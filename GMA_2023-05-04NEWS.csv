1,"DOH: 12 to 23 years to address shortage of nurses, doctors under existing policies","By LLANESCA T. PANTI, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-04," It would take 12 to 23 years for the country to address the shortage of nurses and doctors, respectively, under the current situation, the Department of Health (DOH) said Thursday.
 DOH officer-in-charge Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire made the admission after House appropriations panel senior vice chairperson Stella Quimbo pointed out that a lot of licensed physicians and nurses are not working in the health sector based on government records.
 DOH records showed there are 44,602 physicians and 178,629 nurses working in the country, a far cry from Professional Regulatory Commission’s records showing 95,000 licensed doctors and 509,000 licensed nurses.
 The lack of active nurses and physicians was earlier revealed in a Senate hearing.
 “Not all of our doctors and nurses are working within the [health] sector. They are in other professions such as teaching, Business Process Outsourcing, among others,” Vergeire said.
 Quizzed by Quimbo on how many additional nurses and physicians are needed, the DOH OIC said the country is in need of additional 178,000 nurses and 114,000 physicians.
 “We produce 4,387 physicians and 10,645 nurses per year, so it would take 12 years for the nurses, and 23 years for physicians [to meet such a target],” Vergeire said.
 Quimbo then urged the DOH to address the situation, given the huge number of unmet needs.
 “These figures [of active nurses and physicians] are way behind PRC’s records,” she said.
 Quimbo then suggested that nurses and physicians of state schools and universities should be mandated to render a certain period of service to the country to close the gap.
 “The new graduates of public schools could be mandated, but I imagine it would be difficult to make the same policy for private schools. But for those who graduated from public schools, since their education is financed by taxpayers, they should be willing to render the mandatory service,” she said.
 “This will also serve as an additional training for them and  they will earn their salary, too, so it would not be a complete sacrifice,” she added.—AOL, GMA Integrated News

2,"Over 61M PhilIDs, ePhilIDs delivered — PSA",By GMA Integrated News,2023-05-04," The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) on Thursday announced that over 61 million Filipinos have been issued with their Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) IDs.
 In a statement, the PSA said that so far 29.84 million PhilIDs or national IDs have been delivered by the Philippine Postal Corporation (Post Office).
 The agency added that, at present, a total of 37.11 million PhilIDs were printed from the facilities of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), which accounts for nearly half or 47.3% of the recorded Step 2 registrants at 78.49 million.
 To bridge this gap and ensure that individuals can immediately access the benefits of registering to the PhilSys, the PSA said it introduced the ePhilID (the digital version of the national ID that is printed at registration centers) which holds the same functionality and validity as the physical card.
 The agency said 31.7 million ePhilIDs have already been delivered.
 “This brings a combined total of 61.54 million PhilIDs and ePhilIDs delivered, which can already be used by registrants in transactions,” the PSA said.
 The number of delivered PhilIDs and ePhilIDs accounted for 78.4% of the total Step 2 registrants —means the appearance at registration centers to capture biometric information and verify demographic details.
 Despite issuing ePhilIDs, the PSA said it is continuously engaging with the BSP and Post Office to further accelerate the printing and delivery of the physical cards.
 “The PSA takes great pride in these milestones secured by PhilSys, including huge strides toward the government’s goal of financial inclusion,” it said.
 “Through the co-location strategy with the Land Bank of the Philippines during PhilSys registration, about 8.4 million unbanked Filipinos gained access to formal financial services, of which 5.8 million were able to open transaction accounts. A total of P275.8 million worth of transactions have already circulated in said accounts,” it added.
 The PSA said it is also collaborating with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) for a data matching exercise, where individuals belonging in poor households from the Listahanan are matched with the PhilSys Registry to verify uniqueness.
 The PSA is currently verifying 30.5 million individuals from 5.4 million households in the Listahanan. — Ted Cordero/RSJ, GMA Integrated News

3,Vergeire: Lack of law prevents PH from procuring bivalent COVID-19 vaccines,"By LLANESCA T. PANTI, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-04," The Department of Health cannot buy bivalent COVID-19 vaccines, which targets Omicron COVID-19 and its subvariants, because there is no law authorizing such, DOH officer-in-charge Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said Thursday.
 Vergeire made the disclosure during the House appropriations panel oversight meeting on the budgetary performance of the DOH.
 She said the country is counting on donated bivalent COVID-19 vaccines due to arrive by the end of the month prompting queries from House appropriations panel senior vice chairperson Stella Quimbo.
 “Why is that we are not very active in procuring bivalent COVID-19 vaccines and we are depending on donation. As it is, our healthcare workers remain vulnerable because they are not yet protected,”  Quimbo said.
 Vergeire responded by saying: “We just like to make mention and emphasize that we did all things possible. Unfortunately, procurement is a non-option for us right now because of the existing laws in the country.”
 “We don’t have a basis to do procurement as stated in provisions required by manufacturers for us to be able to enter agreements with them. We opted for donations at this point because we do not have a policy for us to go through the procurement process. The state of calamity was lifted, and because of that, our COVID-19 Vaccination law is already not valid,” she added.
 The country's state of calamity ended last December 31, 2022. President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. did not issue an order extending the state of calamity despite DOH's proposal.
 Vergeire then said that allowing procurement of such vaccines outside of a state of calamity declaration is provided under the proposed bill establishing Center for Disease Control (CDC), a measure already certified urgent by the President.
 The CDC bill has been approved on final reading in the House of Representatives, but the measure is still languishing in the Senate.
 Vergeire said the government has a budget to buy bivalent COVID-19 vaccines.
 “We have a budget from our [COVID-19] loans, that is why we did not include it in the General Appropriations Act proposal,” she said.
 Quimbo, for her part, assured aid in terms of passing legislation for the procurement of bivalent COVID-19 vaccines.
 “If there is a need to pass the law, the Congress is open to it, we will find ways to help you,” she added.—AOL, GMA Integrated News

4,Passengers advised to coordinate with airlines ahead of May 17 airspace shutdown,"By RICHA NORIEGA, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-04," The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) advised affected passengers on Thursday to coordinate with airlines ahead of the May 17 airspace shutdown.   The Philippine airspace will be closed for six hours on May 17 (12 midnight to 6 a.m.) to give way to maintenance activities on the country’s air traffic management system, the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) said on Tuesday.   Around 130 flights and 20,000 passengers are expected to be affected by the temporary closure.
 “Nainform na natin ang mga airline kaya we assume na yung mga pasahero nila ininform nila na tatamaan doon sa date at time na gagawin natin itong repair but just the same inuulit namin doon sa mga pasahero magcheck sila sa mga airlines nila kung itong day na ito doon sila bibiyahe para at least malaman nila yung adjusted departure na ito,” CAAP spokesperson Eric Apolonio said in the public briefing.
 (We have already informed the airlines, so we assume that they have also informed their passengers that will be affected by the date and time that we will be doing this repair, but just the same, we ask passengers to check with their airlines regarding their flights on that day so that they at least know about their adjusted departure.)
 He also apologized to the public for the maintenance activity, saying that this is to prevent glitches similar to the January 1 incident that led to the closure of Philippine airspace, affecting thousands of passengers.
 “Humihingi kami ng paumanhin dahil itong ginagawa namin ay para sa improvement at hopefully wala ng mangyayaring itong glitch na nangyari noong January 1. Kayo rin ang makikinabang dahil tuloy tuloy yung operation ng ating airspace,” he added.
 (We apologize because what we are doing is for improvement, and hopefully this glitch that happened on January 1 will not happen again. The public will also benefit from the continuous operation of our airspace.)
 He said the maintenance activities could be shorter, adding that they will immediately lift the Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) once the repairs are finished. —VBL, GMA Integrated News

5,Comelec presents TOR for an automated election system,"By JOAHNA LEI CASILAO, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-04," The Commission on Elections (Comelec) on Thursday presented its terms of reference for an automated election system for the 2025 mid-term elections.
 At a press conference, Comelec chairperson George Garcia pushed for the Fully Automated System with Transparency Audit and Count (FASTrAC), saying that some of the poll body’s 98,000 vote-counting machines can no longer work.
 The Comelec will use a combination of the Upgraded Optical Mark Reader Paper-Based AES with Direct Recording Electronic capabilities.
 Garcia, however, said they will still conduct a market survey.
 “We’re hoping na magkaroon ng response sa market survey namin before the— even before the end or the early part of June natin. Malalaman niyo po kung merong available pala or hindi available sa market,” Garcia said.
 [We’re hoping to have a response to our market survey before the end of the year of early part of June. You'll be informed if there would be any available in the market or not.]
 “This early gusto na naming ilatag na agad, makapag-procurement kami short of award by July this year so  we can award by January or February next year at makapag end-to-end testing po tayo,” he added.
 [So this early, we want to lay it down ... so we can award by January or February next year and make an end-to-end testing.]
 Garcia also appealed to authorities to carefully look over their proposal when the agency asks for its budget.
 “Sana matignan po ng mabuti yung kagandahan po ng proposal na mai-set aside na namin yung mga lumang makina at maka-procure, makapag-lease ng bagong machine. Take note po, lease lang naman po ito. Hindi pa naman kami bibili,” he said.
 [We hope our proposal will be looked into so that we can set aside the old machines and we can ... lease new machines. Take note, we will lease and not procure yet.] 
 He said that if they do not obtain a budget, they will resort to using the 98,000 VCMs they declared unusable.
 The Comelec chairperson also said that the poll body projects voters to increase to 71 million by the next elections. 
 Garcia said they also have a wish list for suggestions that were not included in the terms of reference.
 “Dito po naipasok namin yung mga suggestions before ng Comelec Advisory Council… may mga pinasok po ako diyan. At yung iba na hindi namin naipasok sa TOR, nilagay namin sa wish list,” he said.
 [We included here the suggestions of the Comelec Advisory Council. And we included suggestions that were not included on a wish list.]
 The Advisory Council had recommended Comelec to use a biometric voter authentication, adopt an internationally recognized election system standard, adopt technologies for transparency, and training, among others. — RSJ, GMA Integrated News

6,"DOLE looking into red-tagging of union members, says official","By JON VIKTOR D. CABUENAS, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-04," The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) is ""reviewing"" issues and concerns regarding the alleged red-tagging of labor union members and activists.
 According to DOLE Bureau of Local Employment division chief Patrick Patriwirawan Jr., the agency is now in talks with stakeholders, and has put in place a mechanism to study and review issues and concerns of unions or workers organizations.
 “Pinag-aaralan pa po itong mga sitwasyon na ito, so kung sa pagtatapos po ng pag-aaral or pagre-review makikita natin na may evidence or wala, doon po malalaman kung ano ‘yung magiging polisiya,” he said in The Mangahas Interviews (TMI).
 (These situations are still being looked into, so upon the completion of the study or the review we see evidence or the lack thereof, that is when we will know what policies will be put in place.)
 A number of local labor groups have long been calling for an end to the red-tagging of trade union members and activists, as well as the release of detained unionists who were allegedly arrested through trumped-up charges in a bid to silence them.
 Patriwirawan said the dialogues will continue but declined to give a specific timeline for this.
 “Ongoing pa rin naman po ‘yung dialogue natin, hindi ko po masasabi kung kailan, pero sinisiguro po natin na bukas po ang Department of Labor and Employment sa pakikipag-ugnayan sa ating stakeholders lalong lalo na sa mga workers organization,” he said.
 (Our dialogue is still ongoing, and I cannot say when it will be completed but we ensure that the DOLE is open to coordinating with our stakeholders, especially with workers organizations.) —KBK, GMA Integrated News

7,PNP chief Acorda vows to prioritize missing ‘sabungeros’ case,By GMA Integrated News,2023-05-04," Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Police General Benjamin Acorda Jr. said the case of missing cockfighting enthusiasts would be prioritized.
 According to Emil Sumangil’s report on GMA Integrated News’ Unang Balita on Thursday, Acorda said he is already asking for regular updates on the search for the six suspects with warrant of arrest.
 “They will be conducting regular meetings pa rin to make sure na hindi po nabibitawan ito...Those incidents na medyo wala pang nai-file na kaso we are pursuing them,” Acorda said.
 (They will be conducting regular meetings to make sure that they would not let this go. We are pursuing those incidents without cases filed yet.)
 According to him, tracker teams have been created for the case.
 Earlier, families of the missing sabungeros asked for help from Acorda for the arrest of the suspects tagged in the abduction of their kin.
 Authorities have been investigating eight formal cases of missing sabungeros involving 34 individuals through the Special Investigation Task Group “Sabungero.”
 In February, an arrest warrant for kidnapping and serious illegal detention was issued for Julie Patidongan, Gleer Codilla, Mark Carlo Zabala, Virgilio Bayog, Johnry Consolacion, and Roberto Matillano Jr.
 This is over the disappearance of John Claude Inonog, James Baccay, Marlon Baccay, Rondel Cristorum, Mark Joseph Velasco, and Rowel Gomez who went missing at the Manila Arena in January 2022.
 Recently, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said tracker teams will be formed to look for the suspects linked to the disappearance of the six sabungeros.
 According to Remulla, names of possible masterminds behind the disappearances have been mentioned but added that authorities still have no evidence.
 Meanwhile, for the case of the alleged abduction of e-sabong master agent Ricardo Lasco in Laguna, the pre-trial hearing is set for June.
 Kidnapping, serious illegal detention, and robbery with violence charges were filed against Police Patrolman Rigel Brosas, Police Staff Sergeant Daryl Paghangaan, and former Police Corporal Roy Navarete.
 The suspects surrendered to authorities and pleaded not guilty to the charges. — Joviland Rita/RSJ, GMA Integrated News

8,Marcos OKs creation of body for 125th PH independence,"By ANNA FELICIA BAJO, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-04," President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. approved the creation of an inter-agency committee for the commemoration of the 125th anniversary of Philippine independence and nationhood.
 Under Administrative Order No. 8, Marcos said a committee should be created to “facilitate the planning and execution of programs and projects” for the commemoration of the 125th Philippine independence anniversary.
 The order noted that the Philippines would commemorate the 125th anniversary of Philippine independence from 2023 to 2026 to “give focus on the freedom that our forebearers struggled for towards that they dreamed for the country and the history that we seek to remember and honor them with.”
 The said committee will be chaired by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) while the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) will serve as vice-chair.
 Republic Act No. 10086 or the “Strengthening Peoples’ Nationalism Through Philippine History Act” provides that the state shall provide the means to ""strengthen people's nationalism, love of country, respect for its heroes and pride for the people's accomplishments by reinforcing the importance of Philippine national and local history in daily life with the end in view of raising social consciousness.”

9,"PH, US set up bilateral defense guidelines to modernize alliance","By ANNA FELICIA BAJO, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-04," WASHINGTON—Defense Department officer in charge Carlito Galvez and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday established the bilateral defense guidelines between the two countries to modernize the alliance cooperation ""for a free and open Indo-Pacific region.""
 According to a fact sheet from the US Department of Defense, the guidelines ""reaffirmed that an armed attack in the Pacific, including anywhere in the South China Sea, on either of their aircraft or armed forces – which includes their Coast Guards – would invoke mutual defense commitments under the 1951 PH-US Mutual Defense Treaty.""
 ""Recognizing that threats may arise in several domains—including land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace—and take the form of asymmetric, hybrid, and irregular warfare and gray-zone tactics, the guidelines chart a way forward to build interoperability in both conventional and non-conventional domains,"" the DOD fact sheet read.
 The guidelines aim to strengthen Manila and Washington's combined deterrence in an evolving security environment, including to:  - Reaffirm the US - Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty’s enduring relevance in addressing both current and emerging threats; - Foster a common understanding of roles, missions, and capabilities within the framework of the alliance to face regional and global security challenges; - Drive unity of effort across all areas of bilateral security and defense cooperation to sustain focus on principal regional security concerns; and - Guide priority areas of defense cooperation to address both conventional and non-conventional security challenges of shared concern.
 In modernizing defense capabilities, the defense departments of the two countries should coordinate closely on the Philippines’ defense modernization, including through the completion of a Security Sector Assistance Roadmap.
 It is also a must to prioritize the procurement of interoperable defense platforms sourced from US programs and Philippine national defense procurement and funding initiatives.
 They should also expand investments in non-materiel defense capacity building including through education and training exchanges, exercises, and other operational activities.
 When it comes to deepening interoperability, there is a need to orient bilateral exercises and activities around improving the combined ability to counter armed attacks on either country as well as threats in space and cyberspace, while expanding the scope, scale, and complexity of exercises.
 Further, the two countries should expand cooperation on maritime security and maritime domain awareness, including through the continued conduct of combined maritime activities, including but not limited to joint patrols.
 Cooperation under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) must also be deepened to strengthen interoperability, including through infrastructure improvements; enhanced joint use of facilities; advancement of additional maritime security, maritime domain awareness, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief capabilities; and rotational US access to Agreed Locations.
 The two countries should also sustain participation in multilateral fora, anchored in shared support for ASEAN centrality.
 Moreover, there is a need to prioritize trilateral and other forms of multilateral cooperation based on common issues of shared concern, including pursuing opportunities for third-party participation and observation in bilateral US - Philippine defense activities.
 The Philippines and the US also vowed to enhance bilateral planning and information sharing on ""early indicators of threats"" to peace and security. 
 Both stressed the need for ""real time information sharing"" and for enhancing information security through consultations on policies, practices and procedures ""for the protection of classified defense and military information.""
 According to a readout of Austin's meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at the Pentagon on Wednesday, they ""lauded the conclusion of new US-Philippines Bilateral Defense Guidelines, which chart their vision for alliance cooperation across all operational domains.""
 ""The two leaders underscored their shared desire to deepen bilateral planning and operational cooperation including an increased tempo of combined maritime activities, such as joint patrols, to support the Philippines’ lawful exercise of its rights in the South China Sea,"" the Pentagon readout said.
 Marcos, who's on an official visit, attended a full honors ceremony at the US Department of Defense grounds, and trooped the line. —NB, GMA Integrated News

10,PDEG chief wants AMLC’s help in probing bank accounts of cops in P6.7-B drug case,By GMA Integrated News,2023-05-04," The acting chief of the Philippine National Police Drug Enforcement Group (PDEG) is coordinating with the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) into whether they could examine the bank accounts of the police officers allegedly involved in the controversial P6.7-billion drug bust last October.
 “Kino-coordinate po natin sa AMLC para makita rin natin kung kailangan ang bank accounts niya na masilip natin,” said PDEG Acting Director Police Brigadier General Faro Antonio Olaguera in Oscar Oida and Jun Veneracion’s report on “24 Oras” on Wednesday.
 (We’re coordinating this with the AMLC to see if there’s a need to examine their bank accounts.)
 “Part of transparency efforts dito sa PDEG...baka mamaya meron silang [they may have] unexplained assets, then let's see,” he said.
 Olaguera likewise expressed willingness to sign a bank secrecy waiver, according to the report.
 “As the acting director of PDEG and as a lawyer myself, I’m very much willing to sign a waiver sa mga bank accounts ko [for my bank accounts] for purposes of transparency,” he said.
 On April 15, a memorandum signed by PNP Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management director Police Major General Eliseo Cruz said 49 PNP officials and personnel were found to have criminal and administrative liabilities in connection with the 990 kilograms of shabu confiscated in October last year.
 Most of the officials and personnel were from the PDEG, with the highest ranking official cited as ex-PDEG chief Police Brigadier General Narciso Domingo. He was removed from his post last month.
 Olaguera, meanwhile, said newly minted PNP Chief General Benjamin Acorda instructed them to study the possibility of abolishing the 17 PDEG special operating units (SOU) due to the reported involvement of the SOU Metro Manila and CALABARZON in the drug raid.
 “They will be consolidated here sa HQ...Kung dito na sila once consolidated na sila and everything is COPLAN-based, madali silang i-monitor natin [They will be consolidated at the headquarters...when they are here and everything is COPLAN-based, they will be easier to monitor],” he added. — Sundy Locus/BM, GMA Integrated News

 According to US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel J. Kritenbrink, the US has been only showing its commitment to the Indo-Pacific and its allies.
 Asked in a briefing if the US looked to establish a new Quad in East Asia based on treaty allies, including the US, the Philippines, Japan, and South Korea, Kritenbrink said, ""I would say no.""
 ""We’re not looking to establish a new Quad. I think what we are trying to do is, again, in every way possible demonstrate the strength and the credibility of America’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific region and to our allies, partners, and friends – including, of course, our treaty ally the Philippines,"" Kritenbrink said.
 In a joint statement following their bilateral meeting at the White House, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and US President Joe Biden adverted to ""trilateral modes of cooperation among the Philippines, Japan, and the United States, as well as the Philippines, Australia, and the United States.""
 The Quad refers to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, made up of the US, Australia, India, and Japan.
 It is a diplomatic network of four countries committed to supporting an open, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and resilient.
 ""I think it’s important to note here, too, that an important element of our engagement as well, though, is that I think it’s important to identify synergies between like-minded partners and explore ways in which informal cooperation might be conducted on a trilateral or other bases,"" Kritenbrink said.
 ""I think as both President Marcos and President Biden noted yesterday, I think there may be opportunities in the future for such close allies as the United States, Philippines, and Japan to look at ways that maybe we could expand our cooperation,"" he added.

14,Win Gatchalian urges principals to shift to blended learning amid El Niño alert,"By HANA BORDEY, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-03," Senate basic education committee chairman Sherwin Gatchalian is urging school principals to shift from in-person classes to blended learning after the state weather bureau PAGASA issued an El Niño alert.
 “Ang pinaka-importanteng responsibilidad ng principals natin ay yung kapakanan o kalagayan ng ating mga estudyante. Kung nakikita nila na sobrang init o may bagyo o anumang hindi maganda sa kanilang lugar, pwedeng mag-cancel ng klase ang ating principals. Pwede rin sila ngayong mag-blended learning,” Gatchalian said in a statement.
 (The most important responsibility of the principals is the welfare of the students. If they observe that there’s extreme heat, a typhoon, or any other bad situation in their area, principals can cancel classes in their respective schools. They can also implement blended learning.)
 On Tuesday, PAGASA issued an El Niño alert after forecasts showed that the phenomenon may emerge in the next three months at 80% probability and may last until the first quarter of next year.
 The El Niño phenomenon is characterized by the abnormal warming of sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and below-normal rainfall.   Gatchalian mentioned reports from the Department of Education indicating that some schools are already implementing a blended mode of learning amid the hot weather.   In-person classes are already held during the cooler hours of the day, but students are supplemented by alternative learning delivery modes.   Under DepEd Order No. 37 Series of 2022, modular distance learning, performance tasks, projects, or make-up classes shall be implemented in the event of canceled or suspended classes to ensure that learning competencies and objectives are still met.   In March, Gatchalian said the country should revert to the old school calendar, where students’ vacations were set in the months of April and May.   The current school year opened on August 22, 2022, and will end on July 7, 2023. —VBL, GMA Integrated News

15,"130 flights, 20,000 passengers to be affected by May 17 airspace shutdown — MIAA","By TED CORDERO, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-03," Hundreds of flights and tens of thousands of passengers are expected to be affected by the scheduled six-hour shutdown of the Philippine airspace on May 17, the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) said Wednesday.
 “Based on our projection there will be around 130 flights that could be possibly affected,” MIAA officer-in-charge Senior Assistant General Manager Bryan Co said at a press briefing.
 “Based on the estimated passenger load, it will be around 20,000 passengers,” he said.
 On Tuesday, the MIAA announced the country’s airspace will be shut down on May 17 to give way for maintenance activities on the country’s air traffic management system to avoid a repeat of the New Year’s Day shutdown.
 The airspace shutdown will be from 12 midnight until 6 a.m. on May 17.
 “That's why the key here is advanced planning...,” the MIAA OIC said.
 He said the MIAA already spoke with aviation stakeholders earlier concerning the airspace shutdown.
 “We have around 40 airline operators here in Manila. Most of them attended via Zoom and the bigger carriers attended face to face, in our meeting at the MIAA office,” Co said.
 “The message here is, since this is a planned outage to improve our air traffic system, we need to do this in a timely manner. That's why we've planned this ahead of time. So even if it's still May 17 we already issued the NOTAM last week and the airlines are already working on how they can reschedule their flights so that they can close for sale those that are affected,” he said.
 “And for those passengers that have already booked, they can get their alternative travel options such as rebooking or get their new timing for their flight,” he added.
 The MIAA said around half of the estimated 130 flights to be affected by the airspace shutdown are international flights, “but majority will be domestic flights.”
 “I would say more than 50% would be domestic. And there will be a number of international flights because we do have international flights that leave at midnight especially going to Korea or the Middle East,” he said.
 In an advisory, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) said corrective maintenance activity will be conducted at the Philippine Air Traffic Management Center (ATMC) on May 3 and May 17 to repair the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR), replace the UPS, and upgrade the ATMS A/B power supply.
 The ATMC facility houses the CNS/ATM system, which manages and supervises the air traffic activities within the Philippine Flight Information Region (FIR).
 On New Year’s Day, over 50,000 passengers were stranded due to the unexpected shutdown of the Philippine airspace caused by power outage because of several equipment malfunctions at the ATMC.—AOL, GMA Integrated News

 “These recurring power interruptions and massive blackouts have plagued Panay Island for several years now and severely impacted not only the daily lives of the people of Panay but also the economic activities in the region,” Poe wrote in proposed Senate Resolution 579 filed on May 2.
 “There is also a need to look into long-term solutions to these power interruptions and outages within the backdrop of the ‘thin’ supply of power in the Visayas grid,” she added.
 The lawmaker emphasized the urgent need to determine the root of the grid disturbances, implement remedial measures, determine who shall be held liable to “finally put an end to the blame-shifting” between the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) and the distribution utilities and to ascertain possible franchise violations.
 In her resolution, Poe cited the NGCP’s placing of the Visayas Grid—which includes Panay, Cebu, Negros, Leyte, Samar and Bohol—on red alert after detecting a grid disturbance, allegedly due to the tripping of the distribution utility (DU) line and causing power plants to disengage from the transmission system.
 The following day, the NGCP downgraded the level to yellow although the NGCP detected another grid disturbance, supposedly due to the tripping of a generation facility.
 While the NGCP reportedly addressed the initial disturbances and restored power supply, they detected yet another grid disturbance that resulted in the disengagement of multiple Panay power plants from the Visayas grid’s transmission system on April 29.
 This system disturbance led to the continuous power outages in some areas of Panay Island including the franchise areas of Aklan Electric Cooperative, Capix Electric Cooperative, Antique Electric Cooperative, MORE Power, Iloilo Electric Cooperative (ILECO) I, ILECO II and ILECO III.
 Poe also referred to President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.'s instructing NGCP to fast-track its improvement works on transmission lines from Cebu to Negros and from Negros to Panay by finishing the third stage of the Cebu-Negros-Panay backbone project. This is expected to provide continuous transmission electricity in the region and inter-connectivity as well.
 The President also instructed the NGCP to hasten the signing of the Ancillary Service Procurement Agreement with the Energy Regulatory Commission.
 On Monday, Marcos said there would be no government takeover amid the frequent power outages in the Visayas region.
 The NGCP has said it is looking into what caused the power outages that affected provinces in Panay Island.
 The grid operator said it is “determining the root cause of these trippings to provide a universal solution to restore and stabilize the power supply chain.”
 Earlier, the NGCP already warned of possible power interruptions this summer season as the Energy Regulatory Commission had denied its request for monthly extensions on ancillary services agreements.
 'Kalokohan 'yan'
 During the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum, Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri told the Department of Energy and the NGCP to “get your acts together,” saying the power outage in Panay Island will not help the country in its development.
 “Get your acts together.  In this day and age, we are 2023, we are trying to be a developing country, we are trying to modernize our structure and infrastructure, we are trying to ask people to invest in the Philippines, and yet, in the middle of the Philippines, in Western Visayas, in Visayas Region there is rotational brownout up to this day,” he said.
 “Okay lang po ‘yong brownout na isang araw, magkaroon ng malfunction, magkakaproblema sa mekanismo, maiintidihan po namin ‘yan.  Pero rotational brownout? Araw-araw? Kalokohan po iyan. Hindi na po nararamdaman ‘yan ng isang developing country.  hindi po nangyayari ‘yan sa Thailand, hindi po nangyayari sa Vietnam ‘yan.   So, the DOE, I have not heard the voice of DOE yet,” he added.
 (A brownout one day due to a malfunction is OK, we can understand that. But rotational brownouts? Every day? That's ridiculous.)
 Although he acknowledged the daily update given to him by the NGCP, Zubiri said these reports are “mere excuses for what is happening.”
 “We need to find the bottom of this. Nung isang araw sawa, ngayon putol na kuryente, mamaya naman may system failure [The other day it was due to a snake, now a power interruption, and then a system failure], that's a poor excuse for running a facility. That is inefficiency,” he said.
 Zubiri then floated the possible government intervention through the DOE and the National Electrification Administration.
 “We have to make sure that government now steps in which is within the ambit of government's powers. They can step in to make sure there is efficient and effective deployment of energy resources to the region,” he said.
 “Kung nagtuturuan lang sila kawawa po ang mga taga Western Visayas at hindi lamang dahil pati na ang Mindanao at Luzon magkaka-problema kung wala po silang sistema na gagawin para I address ang problem sa Visayas,” the Senate president added. — BM, GMA Integrated News

17,Rep. Villanueva blasts DepEd for 'promoting' same-sex union in draft curriculum,By GMA Integrated News,2023-05-03," House Deputy Speaker Eddie Villanueva of CIBAC party-list has accused the Department of Education (DepEd) of promoting same-sex unions among the Filipino youth, which he said is ""anti-God"" and ""unconstitutional.""
 Villanueva issued the statement on Wednesday in reference to the draft Grade 10 curriculum for Araling Panlipunan, which provides for discussions on gender rights and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) community including:
 The same draft curriculum also provides discussions on discrimination in home, schools and work, gender-based hate crimes as well as same-sex union, privileges of same-sex-union, and the difference between same-sex union and same-sex marriage.
 ""We are shocked to discover that the promotion of gender ideology, same-sex union and same-sex marriage is slowly creeping under our nose into the very curriculum of our basic education,"" Villanueva, the leader of Jesus Is Lord movement, said.
 ""What is more worrying is the slant towards promoting and condoning such practices in the minds of our young students,"" he added.
 ""Not only is this anti-God, but also clearly unconstitutional.""
 Villanueva cited Section 13, Article 2 of the Constitution which provides that ""the State shall promote the moral and spiritual well-being of our youth.""
 ""I do not see that the introduction of these topics into our basic education curriculum is heading the right direction,"" he said.
 ""Though this is still a draft and, hopefully, will still undergo revisions, it is just very disturbing that there are proponents of gender ideology inside DepEd that inject this advocacy to the education of our youth,"" he added.
 Villanueva called on ""all stakeholders to be more vigilant on this issue because this a primordial concern that will shape the moral fiber of our youth.""
 ""We plan to have an inquiry or investigation on this matter,"" he said.
 DepEd spokesperson Michael Poa, in response, said that such topics are not new to the basic education curriculum for the right reasons.
 ""The topic on same-sex unions has been in the curriculum since 2013. It seeks to provide learners with a broader understanding of gender-based issues, encourage respect within the community, and promote inclusivity,"" Poa told GMA News Online.
 ""Nonetheless, the Department will consolidate and consider all the comments received, as we move to finalize the K-10 curriculum guide,"" he added. —Llanesca T. Panti/KBK/ VAL, GMA Integrated News

18,US stands with PH vs. Chinese 'intimidation' in South China Sea —US State Dep't official,"By KAREN LEMA, Reuters",2023-05-03," The United States stands with treaty ally the Philippines in the face of harassment by China's coast guard in the South China Sea and remains deeply concerned about ""intimidation"" by Beijing, a senior US official said on Tuesday.
 A visit to the United States this week by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr highlights the strength and endurance of the alliance between the two countries, US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel J. Kritenbrink said. 
 The Philippines on Friday accused China's coast guard of ""dangerous maneuvers"" and ""aggressive tactics"" in the South China Sea, in another maritime confrontation between the two countries. China said the Philippines vessels made ""deliberate provocative moves"".
 ""We remain deeply concerned by (China's) continued intimidation and harassment of Philippine vessels as they continue to undertake really routine patrols within the Philippine exclusive economic zone,"" he said in a teleconference from the United States.
 ""Such actions and behavior on the part of Beijing are truly unacceptable.""
 Kritenbrink also said the United States and its partners recognized the importance of maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait.
 The Philippines and United States on Monday reaffirmed their decades-old security alliance in a trip that marks a dramatic turnaround in their relations, as both countries seek ways to push back China's assertiveness near Taiwan and in the South China Sea.
 US President Joe Biden told Marcos on Monday said the US commitment to defending its treaty ally was ""ironclad"". Marcos said the region had ""arguably the most complicated geopolitical situation in the world right now.""
 Under Rodrigo Duterte, Marcos' anti-US predecessor, relations soured as he sought to court China while openly rebuking Washington.

19,SC suspends lawyer for two years for sexual harassment at work,By GMA Integrated News,2023-05-03," The Supreme Court (SC) suspended a lawyer for two years for committing sexual advances on a colleague at the workplace.
 The high court imposed a two-year suspension from the practice of law on a senior partner in a law firm after a junior associate lawyer filed an administrative case.
 The SC said the respondent was charged with committing “sexually-laced acts ranging from dirty jokes, innuendos, inappropriate personal intimate questions about her romantic relationships, and sharing about his extramarital sexual acts/conquests, to actual sexual advances.”
 It added that the respondent also went confessing that he would have fallen for the complainant had they been within the same age range.
 “Sexual harassment in the workplace is not about a man taking advantage of a woman by reason of sexual desire—it is about power being exercised by a superior officer over his women subordinates,” the SC said.
 “The essence of sexual harassment is not the violation of the victim’s sexuality but rather the abuse of power and authority by the offender manifested through sexually charged conduct or one filled with sexual undertones,” it added.
 The high court said the respondent’s behavior led to “emotional toll” on the complainant who had to seek psychotherapy treatment as a result of his acts.
 Despite the respondent apologizing to the complainant, the SC said it cannot overshadow the gravity of his improper acts in light of his “indifferent and impervious attitude” to the complainant’s feelings.
 “Accordingly, taking into consideration the nature or character of respondent’s complained acts, the frequency of occurrence of the said acts throughout the two-year period he worked with complainant, the degree of his moral influence or ascendancy, and the effect of his acts on her,” the SC said.
 “The Court deemed it proper to impose upon respondent the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for a period of two years,” it added. —Richa Noriega/KG, GMA Integrated News

20,DBM: Marcos admin allots P2.39B for nat’l greening program,"By TED CORDERO, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-03," The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) on Wednesday said the Marcos administration has allocated P2.39 billion for the National Greening Program under the 2023 General Appropriation Act (GAA).
 “As mandated by President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., we will remain committed to attaining inclusive and sustainable transformation toward a greener economy. But we cannot achieve this goal if we neglect our environment,” Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman said in a statement.
 “That’s why, in crafting our national budget, we also put a premium on environmental expenditures. Kaya naman po ngayong taon, mas tinaasan pa natin ang budget para sa climate change programs and activities,” Pangandaman said.
 The National Greening Program is a project under the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).
 It is a massive forest rehabilitation initiative in pursuit of sustainable development for poverty alleviation, food security, biodiversity conservation, environmental stability, and climate change adaptation and mitigation.
 The program covers a land area of 13,565 hectares; 7,249,642 seedlings to be planted; and 158,843 hectares to be maintained.
 “Kita naman po natin ngayon pa lamang, ramdam nating lahat ang epekto ng climate change, lalo na ang pagpasok ng El Niño. Kaya paulit-ulit din pong panawagan ng DBM sa bawat ahensya na maglaan sa kanilang budget proposal ng mga provision para sa pagtugon sa climate change,” Pangandaman added.
 (We are already seeing the effects of climate change, especially with the upcoming onset of El Niño. This is why the DBM is repeatedly calling all agencies to include in their budget proposals provisions for mitigating climate change.)

21,NAIA’s new electrical system won’t necessarily cost P1 billion —Recto,"By LLANESCA T. PANTI, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-03," The Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA)’s request for a new electrical system is an urgent matter, but the amount won’t necessarily reach P1 billion, House Deputy Speaker Ralph Recto of Batangas said Wednesday.
 Recto issued the statement after power outage hit the country’s main airport again on Labor Day, delaying hundreds of flights in the process. 
 Such outage happened just four months after NAIA’s Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Systems for Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM)  malfunctioned on New Year’s Day, an incident that caused at least 282 flights to be delayed, canceled or diverted. 
 ”Even if this light bulb moment had come too late, after the airport had been hit with electrical crashes, it should be treated as an urgent request. Every time NAIA is hit with a blackout, the nation gets a blackeye. So if the promised power system audit would validate that request, then government should buy it, but not necessarily in the amount floated,” Recto said in a statement.
 “Panic buying is the number one procurement sin,” he added.
 Recto then cited that NAIA is not cash-strapped since it is a corporate profit center for the government with gross revenues of the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA), which runs NAIA, reaching P15.2 billion in 2019.
 “From this amount, it remits P1.8 billion to the Treasury as national government’s share of profits, on top of P2.2 billion na tax payments. Despite these, its net income is still at P5 billion, because MIAA also generates revenues outside airport operations,” he said.
 Recto said the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (TIEZA’s) travel tax collection alone reached P7.2 billion in 2019.
 Further, the senator said having additional immigration counters should not be a problem for the Bureau of Immigration, which reported a gross income of P10.5 billion in 2019  and net income of P10.5 billion turned over to the Treasury.
 “In finding the culprit, poverty should be the last suspect,” Recto pointed out.
 Even the Office for Transportation Security, generated P1.1 billion billion in a year out of the Airport Security Fee included in the airline ticket, he added.
 “DOTr said NAIA should have an electrical system audit. If that is the case, why not do a complete checkup to address the problem? Whatever work [that has] to be done should be submitted as one package, so the remedies will not be several Band Aid of cures, but a wellness package,” Recto said.
 “MIAA is a corporation, so they don’t need Congress to authorize such [additional] appropriation,” he added. —KG, GMA Integrated News

22,Blue Ribbon probe on ‘long delayed’ release of national IDs sought,"By HANA BORDEY, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-03," Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III is seeking a Senate blue ribbon committee investigation into the “long delayed” issuance of the national identification cards.
 In filing proposed Senate Resolution 585, Pimentel seeks to identify accountability for malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance, if any, on the part of the leadership in the Philippine Statistics Authority, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and other agencies involved in the issuance of the national IDs.
 “Given the unreasonably prolonged delivery, questionable usefulness, and substandard quality of national IDs, there is already cause to believe that there is malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance on the part of the leadership in the PSA, the BSP, and other relevant agencies in fulfilling its mandate under Republic Act 11055,” he said in the resolution.
 He added PSA, which manages the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) database, has a memorandum of agreement with the BSP to produce and deliver 116 million pre-personalized IDs from 2021 to 2023.
 But Pimentel cited a Commission on Audit report which showed that the BSP delivered only 27,356,750 pre-personalized cards or 76% of the 36 million required number of IDs for 2021.
 “People who registered for the national ID will have to wait around four months before receiving their PhilSys number,” he said.
 “Apart from the delay in meeting the quota for the number of ID cards to be accomplished, there have been complaints about inaccuracy of personal information and blurry images on the cards. In some cases, the IDs are no longer readable after about three months,” he added.
 Further, the lawmaker said even the usefulness of the ID is in question, as some financial institutions refused to recognize the national ID because it lacks the holder’s signature.
 In a separate statement, Pimentel said the government should take swift action to address the issue and provide a clear timeline for when Filipinos can receive their national IDs.
 “It is crucial that the government takes immediate steps to resolve the issue and ensure that all citizens have access to their national ID,” he said.

23,Abalos orders LGUs to prepare for possible El Niño effects,"By JOVILAND RITA, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-03," Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Benhur Abalos on Wednesday ordered mayors to prepare for and mitigate the possible effects of El Niño in their areas.
 This comes a day after state weather bureau PAGASA issued an El Niño alert after forecasts showed that the phenomenon may emerge in the next three months at 80% probability and may last until the first quarter of next year.
 According to DILG, local government units (LGUs) should consider the following mitigation efforts:
 Abalos said these measures can ease the effects of El Niño on agriculture, water resources, marine resources, human health, and the environment.
 “Conserving water is one of the key actions needed to be taken to mitigate effects of El Niño and as public servants, we must set an example. These precautionary steps, albeit small, can make a big difference that can affect our communities,” explained the DILG chief.
 Abalos also asked mayors to work with the regional offices of the Department of Agriculture for cloud seeding, irrigation, water-saving technology, use of drought-resistant and early-maturing seed varieties, cropping calendar changes.
 The DILG, meanwhile, advised the Bureau of Fire Protection to avoid unnecessarily drawing water from fire hydrants and limit it only for purposes of putting out fires.
 The El Niño phenomenon is characterized by the abnormal warming of sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and below-normal rainfall.
 “Recent conditions and model forecasts indicate that El Niño may emerge in the coming season (June-July-August) at 80% probability and may persist until the first quarter of 2024. With this development, the PAGASA El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Alert and Warning System is now raised to EL NIÑO ALERT,” PAGASA said in a statement.
 “When conditions are favorable for the development of El Niño within the next two months at a probability of 70% or more, an El Niño ALERT is issued,” the state weather bureau explained.
 DA measures on El Niño
 Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture (DA) said they are looking into adjusting the planting calendar, or the crops they will grow for the long dry months.
 ""Baka po maga-adjust tayo ng calendar o kaya maga-adjust tayo ng crop na itatanim o kaya paiignitingin and water management,"" said DA Director for Field Operation Services Director U-Nichols Manalo.
 (Maybe we’ll adjust the calendar, the crops that we will plant, or the water management system.)
 The Federation of Free Farmers Cooperative (FFFC) said the administration should also discuss its rice importation measures ahead of the start of the El Niño phenomenon. 
 ""Assuming umangkat sila humaba naman ang lean months, kakasya ba inaangkat nila at available supply para itawid tayo sa next harvest season?"" FFFC National Manager Raul Montemayor said.

24,SRA open to possible probe on high sugar prices,"By GISELLE OMBAY, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-03," The Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) is open to any investigation that may be conducted in connection with the high cost of sugar in some areas, acting Administrator Pablo Luis Azcona said Wednesday.
 Interviewed on Unang Balita, Azcona explained that sugar prices go as high as P136/kilo in select stores as retailers were the ones who dictated the price. He said there are other brands of sugar sold at lower prices.
 “Yes po. Actually, ‘yung price watch and monitoring of the SRP (suggested retail price) ay hindi na sa SRA ‘yun. Ibang agencies ‘yun sa gobyerno,” he said when asked if the SRA is amenable to any investigation on high sugar prices.
 (Yes. Actually, the SRA has no control over the price watch and monitoring of the SRP. That is the job of other government agencies.)
 “What we strive to do is to maintain the balance between the supply and our demand to protect the consumers na hindi bigyan ng rason ang negosyante na itaas na ang price dahil sapat ang suplay [by not giving traders reason to raise the price because the supply is sufficient],” he added.
 “At the same time, very important, is to protect our farmers na ‘yung farmgate price na P60 ma-maintain din [that the farmgate price of P60 is maintained].”
 Azcona said that the country’s stock of refined sugar — both local and imported — is 132% better than last year. This, he said, accumulated to around 385,000 metric tons.
 As for raw sugar, the stock improved to 476,000 metric tons — about 18% to 19% better than a year before.
 Senator Risa Hontiveros on Wednesday questioned the rise of sugar retail prices to P136/kilo, saying the commodity could be sold at only P86 to P90/kilo.
 “Bakit tumaas ang presyo sa halip na bumaba? Bakit may patong na P40 hanggang P60 na di maipaliwanag? Iyan ay resulta na patuloy na pag-corner ng tatlong importer sa suplay ng asukal sa bansa,” she said.
 (Why are the sugar prices going up instead of down? Why is there an addition of P40 to P60 that cannot be explained? That is the result of the three importers continuing to control the country's sugar supply.)
 The lawmaker said retail price control is not the solution to the problem but dismantling the ""cartel"" that controls sugar supply.
 “Baka sa halip na price control sa retail ay price monitoring at control sa wholesale ang dapat pagtuunan ng pansin ng pamahalaan, dahil sa wholesale price nakapagdi-dikta ang makapangyarihang kartel,” Hontiveros added.
 (Instead of price control in retail, maybe the government should focus on price monitoring and control in wholesale, because the cartels could control the wholesale price.)  —KBK, GMA Integrated News

 The PNP said they will focus more on the students, especially minors, who smoke cigarettes or use vape, and will handle the case in accordance with existing laws and local ordinances.
 “Ang focus po nito ay 'yung ating mga menor de edad. Subalit medyo special po ang gagawin nating handling dito sa case na ito sapagkat ang gagawin ng ating pambansang pulisya ay sila muna ay sisitahin, pagbabawalan, at paaalalahanan,” PNP PIO chief Police Colonel Redrico Maranan said.

 “Kukumpiskahin natin ang vape kung talagang medyo matigas ang ulo at paulit-ulit pagsita,” he added.
 (We will confiscate the vape if they are hard-headed and have to be repeatedly reminded.)
 The PNP said the restriction came after they received several complaints from parents through text and messages on social media.
 Based on figures gathered by the GMA News Research Team from the Global Youth Tobacco survey in 2019, it showed that the country is facing a big problem when it comes to discussion on the access of cigarettes.
 Of at least 6,670 students aged 13 to 15 questioned, more than half said they saw cigarettes being sold outside the school, while at least 37.1% of the smokers said that they were not even prevented from buying even when they were minors.
 At Batasan Hills National High School, the parents of the students caught smoking will be called immediately.
 “You want to study in this school? You have to follow our policy. If you cannot stand the heat of the kitchen2, you go out,” Bataan Hills National High School principal Dr. Jojo Escolano said.

 In a statement, Chiong said he received the preventive suspension order, dated April 28, 2023, from the Ombudsman.
 The MIAA chief said his preventive suspension was issued after “previously re-assigning certain MIAA employees"" as part of his effort to improve airport operations.
 Based on the Ombudsman’s order, Chiong along with MIAA Acting Assistant General Manager Irene Montalbo were placed under preventive suspension for alleged grave abuse of authority and grave misconduct.
 The Ombudsman said that Chiong appears to have abused his authority when he designated Montalbo as assistant general manager for finance and administration despite the latter’s unsatisfactory rating, and when he reassigned about 285 MIAA employees.
 The Ombudsman also said that sworn statements from reassigned employees revealed that they were neither informed of the reason for their reassignment nor did they have pending administrative complaints.
 “Based on the evidence on record, it appears that the evidence of guilt of the respondents are strong and the charge against them involves grave misconduct which may warrant their removal from the service,"" the Ombudsman said.
 ""Considering further that respondents continued stay in the office may influence potential witnesses and may prejudice the case filed against them due to their continued access to documentary evidence relative thereto, this Office exercises its power to place respondents under preventive suspension,” added the Ombudsman.  
 The MIAA chief, however, is confident he will be cleared from the allegations.
 ""I am confident of being vindicated and cleared in the end, after I am allowed to present my side as a result of my vision and plan to improve airport efficiency and the financial standing of the authority,"" said Chiong.
 “Putting MIAA in good financial stead is one of my visions. There are others that are just as critical... The country’s main airport faces extremely difficult challenges, and we have started to implement plans and programs that aim to enhance passenger experience at our country’s main gateway,” he added.
 The announcement of Chiong's preventive suspension came a day after a power outage hit Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3, resulting in the cancellation of dozens of flights.
 On Tuesday, the MIAA said it is not ruling out sabotage as a reason behind the power outage.  —VAL/ GMA Integrated News

33,Two trafficking victims in Myanmar now back in Philippines — BI,"By JOAHNA LEI CASILAO, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-04," Two trafficking victims who were recruited through social media have been rescued and are now back in the country, the Bureau of Immigration (BI) announced Thursday.
 Immigration Commissioner Norman Tansingco said the couple arrived in the country on April 25 after working as love scammers in Myanmar.
 ""According to the victims, they were treated like people in military training, even having them do physical workouts under the scorching sun. They also did not receive proper compensation from their employers,"" Tansingco said in a statement.
 The BI said the couple left the country in October 2022 supposedly for a 4-day vacation in Singapore after they were recruited.
 From Singapore, they flew to Bangkok and were transported by armed men to take a boat to Myanmar. The BI said the couple escaped and was assisted by the Philippine Embassy in Thailand.
 Meanwhile, the BI said the couple also claimed that a male Immigration officer facilitated their departure.
 Due to this, Tansingco said the officer has been removed from his post and that an administrative case will be filed against him.
 “Pag wala kayong kasalanan, dedepensahan ko kayo. Pero pag nalaman kong may involvement kayo sa mga kalokohan, tatamaan ka. Wala akong pakiaalam kahit sinong backer mo,” Tansingco said.
 [If you are not guilty, we will defend you. But if I find out that you are involved in irregularities, you will be held responsible. I don’t care who your backer is.]
 According to the BI, two female victims were also intercepted at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1 on April 28 and 29.
 They have been turned over to the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking for investigation and assistance.
 “These syndicates have no sympathy or concern at all for the well-being of their victims. They prey on our poor countrymen who are lured to their evil ways because of their ardent desire to earn a living abroad in order to support their families here,” Tansingco said. — RSJ, GMA Integrated News

 In a courtesy call on Vice President Sara Duterte on Wednesday, Japanese Minister for Health, Labour, and Welfare Katsunobu Kato revealed that 54.7% of Filipino caregivers who took the examination for Japan in March were able to pass, marking the highest recorded for Filipino examinees in the past 10 years.
 He said those who were not able to pass the caregivers’ examination could stay longer in Japan and would be given a chance to retake the exam.
 Kato also said they also need more Filipino nurses to work in Japan under the Philippines-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (PJEPA).
 The Japanese delegation also relayed to the Vice President their demand for skilled workers for construction and industrial waste treatment.
 Boosting education and economic ties
 The OVP said the Japanese delegation also expressed interest in strengthening education and economic cooperation between Japan and the Philippines.
 JICA Representative Sakamoto Takema, meanwhile, bared the programs and projects that Japan wishes to extend to the country, which include training for the Philippine education sector's development this year.
 ""This year we succeeded to convince Tokyo to give more courses and seats for your DepEd (Department of Education) officials and teachers,"" Takema told Duterte, who also sits as the concurrent Education secretary.
 He also said JICA is keen to promote public-private partnerships to encourage Japanese stakeholders to visit the Philippines, address development challenges, and explore future investments.
 Takema also discussed the possible teaching of disaster education to elementary schoolchildren in partnership with the local government units, the recruitment of JICA volunteers to teach Filipino children, and the technical education training program scheduled for August or September.
 Duterte, in another meeting with Special Advisor to the Prime Minister on Women Empowerment Mori Masako, presented an update on the education trend of ""women learners outperforming male learners.""

36,DA-BFAR: Mitigating measures in place to ensure enough fish supply amid El Niño threat,"By TED CORDERO, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-04," The Department of Agriculture–Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (DA-BFAR) on Thursday said that mitigating measures are in place to ensure enough fish supply as the country braces for the onset of El Niño.
 In a statement, DA-BFAR national director Atty. Demosthenes Escoto said that the weather phenomenon, forecast to emerge starting in June, has “positive and negative impacts on the local supply.”
 Escoto said El Niño may be favorable to archipelagic species such as tuna and sardines because these organisms prefer warmer temperatures.
 However, he said, the weather phenomenon may be challenging to land-based aquaculture species like bangus and tilapia since lower water levels may also mean scarcity of dissolved oxygen in their habitat.
 On Tuesday, state weather bureau PAGASA issued an El Niño alert after forecasts showed that the phenomenon may emerge in the next three months at 80% probability and may last until the first quarter of next year. 
 The El Niño phenomenon is characterized by the abnormal warming of sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and below-normal rainfall.
 Escoto said that local fisherfolk could cushion the impact of El Niño on their catch by following good aquaculture practices.
 “The DA-BFAR is encouraging fisherfolk to have good aquaculture practices like having the appropriate stock or number of fingerlings in their cages so they won’t lack oxygen, thus lessening the probability of fish kill occurrence,” he said.
 The DA-BFAR chief reiterated that the agency’s mitigating measures are in place to boost aquaculture production ahead of El Niño.
 “The strategies include intensifying information, education, and communication campaigns among fish farmers; boosting production of fish farming in cages in the mariculture parks; and ensuring sufficiency of fry and fingerlings,” he said.
 Escoto added that the DA-BFAR will also continue its close monitoring of algae blooms for possible red tide occurrence and the provision of technical assistance on fish disease detection and treatment, among others. 
 The DA-BFAR chief also said that the supply and prices of fish in local markets remain stable.   
 Citing the DA-BFAR’s latest price monitoring report, Escoto said bangus are priced at P120 to P160 per kilo, while tilapia range from P130 to P150 per kilo, and local-fresh galunggong are priced at P200 per kilo. —VAL, GMA Integrated News

 ""Mino-monitor po natin ‘yan. Sa data natin Meron na tayong 200,000 first time jobseekers na nabigyan ng tulong sa programa pong ito,"" Patriwirawan said.
 (We are monitoring this. Based on our data, there are 200,000 first time jobseekers who were given assistance under this program.)
 To avail of the free documentary requirement assistance, the DOLE official said a first time jobseeker must first secure and present a certificate from his or her barangay stating that they are a first time jobseeker.
 Patriwirawan said a first time jobseeker could be a senior high school graduate (K-12 program graduate) or a college graduate.
 Enhancing employability
 On enhancing the employability of K-12 graduates, the DOLE official said the agency has career development support and vocational and employment counseling programs through its Public Employment Services Office (PESO).
 ""Patuloy nating susuriin ang employability ng senior high school graduates sa pamamagitan ng continuing partnership sa ating research partners,"" he said.
 (Looking at the employability of senior high school graduates is continuing through partnerships with our research partners.)
 ""Pinagaaralan kung ano ‘yung mga factors sa side ng jobseekers at sa side employers, especially for those na nasa K-12 or senior high school graduates kung ano ‘yung considerations na kakailanganin o titignan upang sila ay ma-hire,"" he added.

39,PH improves to 132nd place in 2023 Press Freedom Index,"By GISELLE OMBAY, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-04," The Philippines has climbed 14 spots higher in this year's World Press Freedom Index, placing 132nd out of 180 countries.
 According to global press watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF), since the Duterte administration, the Philippine media is “extremely vibrant despite the government’s targeted attacks and constant harassment… of journalists and media outlets that are too critical.”
 The RSF also observed that there seems to be less media attacks in the administration of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. as compared to the previous one. 
 Compared to the Duterte administration, RSF said Marcos' policy towards the press “is more consensual.”
 RSF highlighted the acquittal of Nobel laureate and Rappler CEO Maria Ressa and the Rappler Holdings Corporation of four tax evasion charges that were filed under the Duterte administration as an “encouraging development.”
 As to safety, RSF said the Philippines “is one of the world’s deadliest countries for journalists,” considering the gruesome Maguindanao massacre in 2009 that left 58 people dead, including 32 members of the media.
 Though it said that many journalists are still targets of threats and lawsuits in the regional level, RSF noted that there were no journalists and media workers killed since January 1, 2023 although two journalists were reportedly detained. —KBK, GMA Integrated News

 Senate Bill 2074 or the proposed Refund for Internet and Telecommunications Service Outages and Disruptions Act orders PTEs and ISPs to institute a mechanism that will enable them to automatically refund or adjust the bills of their postpaid and prepaid subscribers whenever there are service interruptions.
 The proposed measure will amend Section 20 of Republic Act 7925, otherwise known as the Public Telecommunications Policy Act of the Philippines, to insert a provision mandating refund credit to a customer who experienced a service outage and disruption for an aggregate period of 24 hours or more within a month.
 Estrada, vice chairperson of the Senate committee on public services, said the measure intends to implement fair charging of services of telcos and ISPs to the consumers.
 The lawmaker said it is important that consumers receive the service worth every cent that they pay, and they will not be charged for the service that they were not able to avail of.
 “A refund should be in order if the service outages would accumulate to 24 hours in a month. Serbisyo ang binabayaran natin. Kapag hindi ka nakabayad ng iyong bill sa itinakda nilang due date ng pagbabayad, mabilis pa sa alas kwatro ang pagputol nila ng linya. Kung hindi rin naman nila matutumbasan ang serbisyong binabayaran natin, dapat ikaltas ito sa ating mga bayarin,” Estrada said in a statement.

 At a press briefing, MIAA officer-in-charge (OIC) Senior Assistant General Manager Bryan Co said the agency is expecting 10% to 15% of passengers who would be uninformed of the planned shutdown of the Philippine airspace.
 “MIAA is planning for contingencies in case there are passengers that are unadvised,” Co said.
 The MIAA OIC said the NAIA operator is working with airlines operating at the country’s main gateway to provide “amenities” for passengers “in case they arrive early.”
 On Tuesday, the MIAA announced the country’s airspace will be shut down on May 17 to give way for maintenance activities on the country’s air traffic management system to avoid a repeat of the infamous New Year’s Day shutdown.
 The airspace shutdown will be from 12 midnight until 6 a.m. on May 17.
 Co said the MIAA has already advised airlines ahead to “ensure that all passengers are advised on a timely manner.”
 The airspace shutdown is in line with the scheduled maintenance or replacement of the UPS of the CNS/ATM.
 UPS stands for the Uninterruptible Power Supply while CNS/ATM refers to the Communications, Navigations, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management.
 For his part, Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) spokesperson Eric Apolonio said the agency has already coordinated with all the airlines and airport operators to prepare for the maintenance activity.
 Apolonio said that while the maintenance activity is scheduled for six hours, the actual repairs could be shorter.
 ""Hopefully baka 4:30 [a.m.]…  sakali baka before 5 a.m. ma-lift na natin kung maayos talaga at mabilis ang proseso,"" the CAAP official said.
 On New Year’s Day, over 50,000 passengers were stranded due to the unexpected shutdown of the Philippine airspace caused by power outage because of several equipment malfunctions at the ATMC.
 Apolonio said after the maintenance activity there will be less likelihood that the New Year’s Day incident will happen again as redundancies, backups, and the maintenance provider are in place to fix the system should there be another malfunction.—AOL, GMA Integrated News

50,Zubiri on NAIA mess: Fix airport issues or let foreigners manage,"By HANA BORDEY, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-03," Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri on Wednesday asked President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. to issue an ultimatum to the management of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) to fix the problems at the country’s main gateway.   Alternatively, the government can enter into a contract with foreign firms to manage NAIA, the Senate leader said at the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum.
 “The President should just give an ultimatum to the NAIA management… Kung di niyo kaya iyan, i-outsource na lang natin ‘yan. Gano’n na lang (If they can't do it, just outsource). It’s within his powers. And then we can do a bidding process and ask the internationally known and recognized airport management groups to manage it,” Zubiri said.
 “My point is mediocre is not an option for the Filipinos. We have to handle it efficiently and effectively. And that is why we are appealing to our public servants in our country,” he added.
 The Senate chief made the statement after a power outage hit NAIA Terminal 3 on Labor Day. The incident happened four months after the Philippine airspace shutdown on New Year’s Day.   Zubiri said the Philippines’ main airport can be handled by the group that manages Singapore’s Changi Airport, which was hailed as the world’s best airport for 2023, according to airport and airline review firm Skytrax.
 “Under the (Revised) Public Service Act, we approved the law, it can be run already by internationally known corporation. So that is an option kung hindi kaya ng mga kababayan, mga genius na nandodoon ngayon ay baka pwedeng ibigay na lang natin sa iba,” he said.
 (So that is an option; if our countrymen cannot do it, especially the geniuses at NAIA, maybe we can give the management of the airport to other people.)
 In a Super Radyo dzBB interview, Senate public services committee chairperson Grace Poe said she believes that the Labor Day power outage at NAIA was not due to sabotage but due to negligence.   The lawmaker said the incident was connected to the officials' admission that the power backup can only supply 30% of the airport’s electricity demand.   She also mentioned a 2017 audit of the airport’s electrical system, but there were no improvements or adjustments made over the past few years.
 “Parang nakikita ko medyo talagang may kapabayaan sapagkat nu’ng nakalipas na taon hindi naman nila sinabi sa amin na kailangan namin ng generator para magkaroon ng 100% backup. Bakit di nila sinabi yon?” she added.
 (I think there was negligence because, over the past year, they did not ask us for a generator for 100% backup power. Why didn't they tell us?)
 “Parang ina-angguluhan nila na national security issue ito. Hindi natin alam hangga’t matapos [ang imbestigasyon] pero sa tingin ko hindi e. Kasi alam nga nila na 30% power lang ang pwedeng mag-function pag nagkaron ng blackout. So obviously, talagang may kakulangan,” she went on.
 (It appears that they are portraying it as a national security issue. We won't know for sure until the investigation is over, but in my opinion, it's not. They were aware that in the event of a blackout, just 30% of systems would function. So obviously, there is a shortcoming on their part.)
 On the Manila International Airport Authority’s (MIAA) request for a P1-billion budget for the procurement of power generators for NAIA terminals in case of a power failure, Poe said the transportation officials should have requested this during the budget deliberations last year.
 Poe said they can tap the unprogrammed funds under the 2023 General Appropriations Act or revolving funds from NAIA operations.
 Meanwhile, Senate finance committee chairman Sonny Angara said the Department of Budget and Management should include MIAA’s request when they submit the proposed budget for fiscal year 2024 because this is considered “critical infrastructure.”
 A supplemental budget and the use of savings are other options to fund the requested power generator, he added.
 During the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum, Zubiri said that they already told Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista to provide a list of equipment that needs to be funded.
 “Airports are strategic facilities,” he said.
 Poe said she “intends” to call for a hearing not only to tackle the power outage in NAIA but also the other problems in the air transportation system and land transportation, including the failure of the Land Transportation Office to produce vehicle plates.
 She also urged Bautista, a former airline executive, to exercise caution when taking advice from his subordinates.
 “Sa tingin ko, kailangan din sya mag-ingat doon sa mga nagbibigay ng payo sa kanya kasi parang hindi natin alam kung tama ang intensyon ng mga ‘yan,” she said.
 (Because we cannot be certain that the advice is being given with the best of intentions, I believe he should act with caution.)
 “Ang DOTr napakalawak e. Kahit na ang expertise mo let’s say airline, meron pa rin d’yang ground transport, merong sea [transport]. So you really have to choose the right people because you can’t be an expert in [everything]…Parang nagkaroon ng lamat e. Parang nagkaroon ng blemish [‘yung record niya],” she added.
 (The DOTr is a big agency. Even if your expertise is, let’s say, airline, the department also supervises ground transport and sea transport. So you really have to choose the right people because you can’t be an expert in [everything] …It seems that his record has been blemished.)  —VBL, GMA Integrated News

51,Senate committed to pass minimum wage hike bill before sine die adjournment — Zubiri,"By HANA BORDEY, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-03," The Senate is committed to pass a bill that will increase the minimum wage in the country before the sine die adjournment on June 2, Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri said Wednesday.
 “[The bill] has the support of the Senate President, the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader…in support of a legislated wage hike.  So, sa tingin ko, maikli na lang po ang debate doon sa Senado, [I think there will be a shorter debate on this] and we’re committed to hopefully pass this before the break,” Zubiri said during the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum.
 ”As far as [I] and many of my colleagues are concerned, we want to make this a stand, a statement that the Senate is looking out for the welfare of our workers. It is not a political gimmick. Hindi po ito political gimmick,” he added.
 The sessions in Congress will resume on May 8 and will adjourn sine die on June 2.
 While he is pushing for a legislative wage hike, Zubiri said they will still hear the concerns of the business sector, especially the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).
 “Ang pakiusap po ni Senator Jinggoy Estrada sa akin, [he is the] chairman ng Committee on Labor – tignan natin kung puwede nating gawing graduated for micro and small and medium enterprises. Para sa ganoon, ‘yong mga livelihood rin ng mga maliliit na negosyo at livelihood ng ating mga MSMEs ay hindi apektado,” he said.
 [What Senator Jinggoy is asking is if it would be possible if (the increase) will be graduated for micro and small medium enterprises, so that the livelihood of our MSMEs won’t be affected.]
 “Dahil malaki naman talaga ‘pag almost P3,000 ang dagdag sa sweldo ng iba’t ibang mga workers nila.  So, we can do a graduated [increase] depending on the total income generated by the corporation,” he added.
 Zubiri said they will “look for a balance” so they can pass the measure as early as possible.
 In the same forum, Zubiri took a swipe at the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards for the alleged slow resolution of petitions to increase the daily salary of workers.
 “Napakahina ng regional wage boards, napakabagal ng galaw nila. At kung hindi lang umiiyak at nagra-rally ang mga manggagawa sa ibat-ibang tanggapan ng regional wage boards, hindi po gumagalaw ang ating mga regional wage boards. Pag gumalaw naman, ang kanilang increase ay P16, P15 kada araw. Ano po ang makakain ng tao sa P15,” he said.
 “Alam ninyo po ganito mangyayari dyan, there will be a diaspora of Filipino workers. Maraming aalis ng bansa dahil hindi nila kaya ang mga sweldo na tinatanggap nila dito,” he added. 
 He also observed that Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma is not calling on the regional wage boards to fast-track the resolution of petitions to increase the minimum wage for workers.
 “I appeal to the Secretary, I understand his position na kailangan may balanse sa labor may balanse sa management at pagmamay-ari ng mga kumpanyang ito, but I have yet to hear from the Secretary his appeal to the regional wage boards to increase rates,” Zubiri said.
 Earlier this week, Estrada announced that the Senate Committee on Labor, Employment and Human Resources Development will tackle the bills seeking to increase the minimum wage in the country on May 10.
 Among the measures that are expected to be tackled are the bill seeking to reform the system of increasing the minimum wage, the bill seeking to provide P150 across the board wage increase and the bill amending the Wage Rationalization Act, which will impose penalties against employers who do not follow the daily wage increases.
 In March, Zubiri filed Senate Bill 2002 which proposes a P150.00 across the board increase in the minimum wage of workers in the private sector to cover food, water, fuel, electricity, clothing, transportation, rent, communications, and other personal needs. — RSJ/VBL, GMA Integrated News

52,Bryan Co designated as MIAA OIC after GM Chiong placed under preventive suspension,By GMA Integrated News,2023-05-03," Manila International Airport (MIAAO) Senior Assistant General Manager Bryan Co will take the helm of the agency as officer-in-charge after its chief, Cesar Chiong, was placed under preventive suspension by the Ombudsman.
 According to GMA Integrated News' reporter Joseph Morong’s tweet, Co was designated as officer-in-charge of MIAA on Wednesday after the agency’s board approved his designation in a meeting this morning.
 At a press briefing, Co said that “the plans and programs will continue to move forward as far as the MIAA is concerned.”
 The MIAA OIC said that the agency will continue to tackle the May power interruption at NAIA Terminal 3.
 “There are ongoing investigations and as discussed with you the other day, we have the technical side and we have the other side that where we involved NICA (National Intelligence Coordination Agency). So those things are continuing smoothly. So the transition is very orderly as far as the functions that were being done in the Office of the General Manager,” Co said.
 On May 1, a power outage hit Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3, resulting in the cancellation of dozens of flights.
 The MIAA said it is not ruling out sabotage as a reason behind the power outage.
 On Tuesday, Chiong announced that he was put under preventive suspension due to a complaint alleging he committed grave abuse of authority.
 Based on the Ombudsman’s order, Chiong along with MIAA Acting Assistant General Manager Irene Montalbo were placed under preventive suspension for alleged grave abuse of authority and grave misconduct.
 The Ombudsman said that Chiong appears to have abused his authority when he designated Montalbo as assistant general manager for finance and administration despite the latter’s unsatisfactory rating and when he reassigned about 285 MIAA employees.
 The MIAA chief, however, is confident he will be cleared from the allegations.
 ""I am confident of being vindicated and cleared in the end, after I am allowed to present my side as a result of my vision and plan to improve airport efficiency and the financial standing of the authority,"" said Chiong. —Ted Cordero/ VAL, GMA Integrated News

 Angat Dam irrigates several farmlands in the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga.
 Last month, the NWRB raised the allocation for the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) to 52 cms from the earlier approved increase of 50 cms. 
 The same allocation was also conditionally approved for the month of May.
 The MWSS is the government’s water distribution utility serving Metro Manila and nearby provinces. It has concession deals with Manila Water and Maynilad to serve the east and west zones of Metro Manila.  —KBK, GMA Integrated News

55,Marcos: No sector that wasn't touched by PH-US partnership,"By ANNA FELICIA BAJO, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-03," WASHINGTON — President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. said there is no sector that was not touched by the partnership between the Philippines and the United States.
 During a meeting with the United States-Philippines Society, Marcos said he was pleased with the significant progress both Manila and Washington have made towards strengthening security alliance.
 ""Yes now, prominent are the security defense issues, but if you look at what do we do in partnership, in coordination with the United States, and there’s no part of—there’s no sector that isn’t touched by that partnership,” he said.
 The President said the strengthening and deepening of relations between the two countries has been ""a big step forward with all the developments that have been happening.""
 “It has been terribly useful for us to talk about redefining our Mutual Defense Treaty and this, I think, has given us the opportunity to layout as you say that roadmap for the economy and for another big issue in the Philippines – climate change and all the other big issues,” he said.
 The USPS vowed for greater cooperation and partnership in the development and economy of the Philippines. It is a non-profit, bi-national organization of prominent civic and business leaders of the US and the Philippines.

56,"OPAPRU, DSWD to give P100K cash aid to each ex-MILF combatant",By GMA Integrated News,2023-05-03," The Office of the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unity (OPAPRU) and the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) on Tuesday vowed to provide P100,000 cash assistance to each decommissioned Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) combatants for their socioeconomic development.
 The two agencies signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to roll out a P396 million-worth socioeconomic program for the  former rebels, as part of the government's commitment under the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro (CAB) to uplift the lives of former MILF combatants and their families.
 Under the MOA, the DSWD will implement the program by providing an outright cash assistance of Php 100,000 for each of the decommissioned MILF combatants.
 Of this amount, P80,000 shall be sourced from the Bangsamoro Transitory Family Support Package (BTFSP), while the remaining Php 20,000 shall be provided under the Livelihood Settlement Grant (LSG) of the DSWD’s Socioeconomic Program.
 The BTFSP includes food and non-food basic assistance for the decommissioned combatants and their families, while the LSG may be used by the former rebels to start their livelihood activities.
 The MOA shall also cover the transitional cash assistance for the 1,300 decommissioned MILF combatants under Phase 3, and 2,000 combatants under Phase 4; operational expenses in the conduct of case management of decommissioned combatants and Bangsamoro Islamic Auxiliary Women Brigades; and administrative costs.
 DSWD Secretary Rex Gatchalian expressed his agency’s full support to the Bangsamoro peace process.

58,Panel recommends admin charges vs. 4 senior PNP officials over alleged drug links,By GMA Integrated News,2023-05-03," The five-man advisory group has recommended that the courtesy resignations of four ranking police officials be accepted over their alleged involvement in the illegal drug trade, Super Radyo dzBB's Mark Makalalad reported on Wednesday.
 Quoting former Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Rodolfo Azurin Jr., who heads the advisory group, the report said administrative charges were also recommended to be filed against the four yet-to-be-identified officials.
 The four — two police generals and two police colonels — were among the 36 senior police officials earlier suspected to be involved in the illegal drug trade, the report said.
 Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos on January 4 appealed to senior PNP officials to submit their courtesy resignations as part of the government's efforts to rid the police force of officers with links to narcotics syndicates.
 The five-man advisory group was formed to review the resignations and make recommendations.
 The dzBB report quoted Azurin as saying that he would leave the decision on whether to identify the four ranking PNP officials to the National Police Commission (Napolcom).
 Azurin also reportedly said that he is hoping that current PNP chief, Police General Benjamin Acorda Jr., will sustain their recommendation.
 In an interview with reporters, Abalos, who chairs Napolcom, said they will make an announcement in two days because they are still working on some legalities.
 “We are going to make a statement about this, okay? Just give us about, probably, two days so that all legalities ma-cover namin dito [we can cover all legalities here],” he said.
 “We just want that when we make a statement talagang airtight ang lahat na ito [it’s already airtight],” he added.
 Asked if they will name the implicated police officials, Abalos said they will “announce everything.” —with Joviland Rita/KBK, GMA Integrated News

 According to the White House, this aims to ""fully realize their positive value for local development and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.""
 ""To that end, the United States will expand our work in these communities and areas to support health, education, environmental protection, economic growth, and disaster preparedness,"" the White House said.
 Malacañang had announced four new EDCA sites: Naval Base Camilo Osias in Sta Ana, Cagayan; Lal-lo Airport in Lal-lo, Cagayan; Camp Melchor Dela Cruz in Gamu, Isabela; and Balabac Island in Palawan.
 Existing EDCA sites are Antonio Bautista Air Base in Palawan, Basa Air Base in Pampanga, Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija, Mactan-Benito Ebuen Air Base in Cebu, and Lumbia Air Base in Cagayan de Oro City.
 Signed in 2014, EDCA grants US troops access to designated Philippine military camps and allows them to build facilities, and pre-position equipment, aircraft, and vessels. Permanent basing is prohibited.
 Department of Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo has said six of the 16 projects in the five initial EDCA locations would be completed this year.
 There had been concerns about these new EDCA sites, with China saying that the US only intends to use the latest sites to push for its interests and agenda “at the expense of peace and development of the Philippines and the region at large.”
 Manalo had said the Philippines would not allow the US to use the EDCA sites for activities against China in connection with the tension in the Taiwan Strait. —NB, GMA Integrated News

61,US to transfer more assets to AFP,"By ANNA FELICIA BAJO, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-03," WASHINGTON — The United States will provide additional assets to the Philippine military in support of the latter's modernization efforts.

 Further, two Cyclone-class coastal patrol vessels were already transferred to the Philippines in late April, and are now en route to Manila.
 The White House said these assets would support the AFP's modernization program by enhancing its maritime and tactical lift capabilities.
 During his meeting with President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. during the latter's visit to the White House, May Biden made a commitment to continue supporting the modernization of the Philippines’ military sector.

62,Marcos cites ‘turbulent times’ in PH-US ties but says friendship won,"By ANNA FELICIA BAJO, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-02," WASHINGTON—President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.  on Monday night (Washington time) said the friendship between the Philippines and the US had prevailed even after what he called ""turbulent"" between the two sides.
 According to the Presidential Communications Office, Marcos said his visit to the US was ""vital especially during the 'turbulent times' the relations between the Philippines and US went through in the past years.""
 “But similarly to our ambassadors' friendships, like two friendships,  you go to turbulent times when there are misunderstandings, when there are difficulties, when other forces prevail upon both sides of the partnership,” Marcos said during a dinner hosted by the Philippine Embassy at the Blair House.
 “But between the Philippines and the United states, we have prevailed through all that like a true friendship,"" he added.
 ""And the reason for that I believe is that we truly have come to an understanding as to how we believe certain values and what is important, and our role in the world and that has never really been diminished,”  Marcos said.
 ‘Fundamental part’
 Among the US officials who attended the dinner toast were officials of the US treasury and agriculture departments, and a trade representative.
 At the dinner, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken highlighted the importance of Filipinos and Filipino-Americans when it comes to building a strong foundation for the US.
 Blinken said that Filipinos and Filipino-Americans were a ""fundamental part of the fabric of the United States.”
 He said the Philippines and the US forged a bond 70 years ago based on defense and security, adding that this further strengthened the two nations’ ties.
 “We pledged our faith on the principles of the United Nations charter,” Blinken said.
 “And just last year, thanks to the leadership of President (Joe) Biden and President Marcos, we have significantly strengthened our alliance. We’ve launched new initiatives together to create economic opportunities for Americans and Filipinos alike,"" he added.
 ""Because last year, trade between our countries was worth more than $25 billion, a new record, and today President Biden announced that he will send the first ever presidential trade and investment mission to the Philippines,” Blinken said.
 He said the necessary measures had been taken to modernize security alliances “so that our forces can work even closer together despite natural disasters.”
 ‘Remarkable ties’
 Earlier on Monday, Marcos and Biden affirmed a series of partnerships aimed at strengthening the alliance of Manila and Washington.
 In a joint statement, Marcos and Biden hailed the “remarkable ties of friendship, community, and shared sacrifice that serve as the foundation of the U.S.-Philippines alliance.”
 Marcos' predecessor former President Rodrigo Duterte during his administration enhanced the Philippines' ties with China while reserving strong words against the US.
 In early 2020, Duterte ordered the abrogation of the VFA—the agreement which allowed American soldiers to regularly train with their Filipino counterparts in the country.
 This developed after the US revoked the visa of his close aide and former police chief now senator, Ronald Dela Rosa.
 Marcos said the ties between the Philippines and the United States need to be revisited regularly to make the most out of the friendship and partnership.
 ""I was telling the President, it’s very hard to categorize the partnership between the PH and US as one thing. It’s not just in the area of defense... but in terms of trade, in terms of education, in terms of culture, in terms of people-to-people as it has come to be known. All of these things have been going on for a hundred years,” Marcos said.
 ‘Need to revisit’
 “But it still needs to be continually revisited so that we can make the most of our friendship and our partnership. And so that is the world as I see it today and the reasons that will come. That is why I am very grateful for the invitation of President Biden to come to Washington, D.C., and gain the opportunity to meet the leaders of the government,” he added.
 Marcos reiterated in the dinner the need for the Mutual Defense Treaty to evolve amid the developing security situation.
 ""It should evolve because the situation that we are surrounded with changes and we must evolve with that. Therefore it is extremely important that we have these interactions, it's extremely important that we are constantly in communication. It is extremely important that we understand what it is we are trying to achieve,” Marcos said.
 Marcos and Biden affirmed a series of partnerships aimed at strengthening the alliance between Manila and Washington.

64,Key security policy document between PH and US to be released Wednesday - diplomat,By MICHAELA DEL CALLAR,2023-05-02," A crucial security policy document outlining the future of the Philippines-United States alliance will be released in Washington when President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. visits the Pentagon for a meeting with American defense officials on Wednesday, a senior US embassy diplomat said.   Earlier announced in a White House factsheet following a meeting between US President Joe Biden and Marcos on Monday, the Bilateral Defense Guidelines are seen as an upgrade to the Philippines and America’s security ties as they seek to “institutionalize key bilateral priorities, mechanisms, and processes to deepen alliance cooperation and interoperability across land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace.”   “One thing that would come out of this visit and is on track to be made public this Wednesday when President Marcos visits the Pentagon is the first ever Bilateral Defense Guidelines between the US and the Philippines,” said Brett Blackshaw, political counselor at the US Embassy, at a forum hosted by Stratbase-ADR Institute on Tuesday.
 “It is a very useful milestone in the alliance, sort of articulating why we have this alliance now.”
 Blackshaw said that the document, similar to what the US has with other allies, like Japan, “does not talk about third countries” but is “a useful way to lay out what are the contemporary challenges that we face, what are the mechanisms that we use to manage them, and shared priorities going forward.”   “That’s the core of our treaty; that’s the core of our alliance because the security challenges can evolve and change as they have,” Blackshaw said, adding the text of the document is being finalized.   A White House statement said the Guidelines “support the continued modernization of the alliance and ongoing efforts to adapt alliance coordination to respond to the evolving security environment.”   It seeks to “advance efforts to deepen interoperability, particularly through enhanced bilateral planning, information sharing, accelerated defense capability development, and collaboration on emerging security challenges.”   The adoption of the key document highlights the renewed and deepening cooperation between Manila and Washington, which was fractured during the time of Marcos’ predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who turned to America’s regional rival China in exchange for more economic aid and investments.   It also demonstrates the remarkable progress in the relations between the two longtime allies under Marcos as both countries share deep concerns about China’s growing power in the region, particularly in the South China Sea, which is being claimed by Beijing nearly in its entirety even as its smaller neighbors, like the Philippines, have insisted on lawful rights over parts of the resource-rich waters.   Blackshaw said the Guidelines articulate “why we have this alliance and looking ahead in the future, what are our priorities, and how do we envision meeting them,” as he stressed the importance of stronger US-Philippines cooperation.   “You are not just an important partner in Southeast Asia; you are an ally. That word in our foreign policy is sacrosanct,” Blackshaw said. —VBL, GMA Integrated News
