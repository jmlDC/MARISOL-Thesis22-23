1,DICT to launch SIM Check to fight scammers,byOrlan L. Mauricio,"May 5, 2023,","The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) is set to launch “Project: SIM Check Mo” next week as part of the government’s efforts to combat cybercrime.
ADVERTISEMENT
The project involves a text messaging service thru the DICT’s Hotline“1326” that provides every citizen the capability to validate in 10 seconds the partial identity and status of a SIM number of a suspected scammer.
All one needs to do is text SIM CHECK, space, plus the 11-digit number and send it to 1326.
The sender will then receive the status of the SIM, which will indicate whether it is already registered or not, the initials of the SIM owner, and a remark on whether it has a good or derogatory record.
“The project needs to be launched ASAP and immediately while we await the expiration of the 90-day extension period for the mandatory sim registration under Republic Act 11934,” DICT Executive Director Alexander Ramos of the agency’s Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center said.
The official said the three-month extension is a “very long and dangerous time that can be taken advantage of by scammers to continue all sorts of scheming to swindle unsuspecting individuals.”
“Cybercrime prevention is a three-way shared responsibility between the telcos and the consumers-subscribers. The government acts as the supervising-cyber security to ensure that the public enjoys a safe cyberspace,” Norman Ancheta, OIC of the Inter Agency Response Center that handles the 24/7 operations of DICT’s Hotline 1326, said.
“Project SIM Check” is also in line with DICT Sec. Ivan John Uy’s priority of ensuring cyber security for the public while the country transitions to having all SIM card users registered by July 25, the deadline of the 90-day extension, the DICT said.
Ramos assured the public that compliance with all data privacy requirements is presently being ironed out with the legal liaison of the National Privacy Commission and the CICC.
“Compliance with the SIM Card Registration Law is simply analogous with responsible gun ownership. Do you want to have a community with thousands of unregistered firearms or licensed gun owners? If all the sim card owners are registered with the government, the chances of its users committing crimes will likely be less because they know the consequences,” he said.

Acorda commanded the chiefs of police and provincial directors to coordinate with local government units and school officials to guard the youth from using vape and smoking, “because we know the ill effects they have on their young bodies,” he added.
Maranan also assured the public that the police will handle the cases carefully, especially cases concerning minors.
“There should be special handling of their cases too. We don’t want them to be thrown into jail or just file charges against them. We want to warn them, remind them, and give them proper information (on vaping and smoking),” he stressed.

DILG Secretary Benjamin Abalos, Jr. has recommended to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. the sharing of fishing areas following a meeting with local leaders and affected fishermen in the island.
“The DILG and BFAR will adopt a cluster approach to ensure that all affected fisherfolk will have a place to go and congestion in one fishing area will be avoided,” Abalos said. Joel E. Zurbano

However, the duration of fishing ground sharing is still uncertain, according to Abalos.
“As soon as the fish samples are okay and there is no more contamination of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the affected areas of Oriental Mindoro, the fisherfolks can already do their fishing activities in their own territorial waters,” he said.
Aside from identifying alternative fishing grounds, the DILG will also review existing related policies on the management of municipal waters.

9,Tolentino wants probe on gov’t plans vs. avian flu,byMacon Ramos-Araneta,"May 4, 2023,","Sen. Francis Tolentino wants a Senate probe on the government’s policies to avoid an avian influenza flu outbreak in the country.
ADVERTISEMENT
He noted that the high inventory of imported poultry products amid the unabated importation of finished goods “poses a significant threat to the immediate and long-term prospects of the local poultry sector in the county.”
He said this also puts consumers at risk of the potential adverse effect of other transboundary diseases. “This  will also ultimately lead to adverse public health effects.”
According to the senator, there should be a clear and solid policy from authorities to avert and ward off any possible outbreak of transboundary animal diseases in the country. Macon Ramos-Araneta
“It is high time for the Senate to ensure that risk-based planning, strict prevention protocol, and proactive legislative action are in place to minimize public health risk and fundamentally, to accord our local poultry sector with the support and opportunity as active
partners in development and nation building,” Tolentino said in filing Senate Resolution No. 580.
Tolentino’s bill seeks to determine the appropriate government actions in preventing and controlling another possible outbreak of avian flu.
As of February 9, 2023, nine regions remain affected by the avian flu as per the Bureau of Animal Industry, while more than 300,000 poultry mortalities have been recorded since the outbreak of the said virus the country in 2022, according to the report submitted by the said agency to the National Banner Program Committee on Poultry and Livestock (NBPC on PL) on February 14 of this year.
The World Organization for Animal Health earlier cautioned that the presence of Avian Flu “may restrict international trade in poultry meat that can heavily impact economies.”
In May 2022, the A-H5 variant outbreak in wild birds and poultry has been reported to spread in 16 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, United States and Canada with the first human infection recorded in Ecuador in January 2023 and consequently, deaths of hundreds of sea lions and pelicans in Peru.
Tolentino has expressed concern on the matter especially over reliable reports that various commercial public wet markets in Metro Manila recently have revealed their respective inventories of imported chicken that either: (a) those that can be identified are from Brazil, USA, Netherlands and Canada with expiration dates ranging from 1 to 2 years from the date of production; (b) with no labels pertaining to production and distribution; and; (c) without sticker from the National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS).
ADVERTISEMENT“The sale of the said imported poultry meat brazenly violates the provisions of the law under Republic Act No. 7394, or the ‘Consumer Act of the Philippines’… it fails to qualify with the Philippine National Standards on the Code of Hygienic Practice for the Sale of Fresh Agriculture and Fishery Products in Markets and Authorized Outlets,” the senator stressed.

10,‘Govt needs to return franchise tax to POGOs’,byRey E. Requejo,"May 4, 2023,","The Supreme Court (SC) has upheld its decision issued last year which declared as unconstitutional the government’s imposition of a 5% franchise tax on gross bets from gaming operations of the Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs).
ADVERTISEMENT
In an eight-page resolution, the SC denied the motion for reconsideration filed by the Department of Finance (DOF) and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) seeking the reversal of the said ruling.
The high court directed the government to refund POGO licensees of the 5% franchise tax it collected from them under the Bayanihan 2 Law.
“It is evident that not to order a refund will result in injustice and inequity on the part of the POGO licensees. Thus, any amount that was collected from the POGO licensees based on the implementation of the Bayanihan 2 Law, and prior to the passage of R.A. 11590  (An Act Taxing Philippine Offshore Gaming Operations) should be returned,” the high court declared.
“All things considered, the Court finds no compelling reason to reverse and set aside the assailed decision. Thus, the motion for reconsideration must be denied with finality,” the SC said.
The SC also ordered that an entry of judgment be issued immediately in the case.
In its motion for reconsideration, the government through respondents DOF  and the BIR, argued that the assailed tax issuances are valid as these were issued on the account of the expanded licensing and regulatory authority of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor).
The said respondents maintained that offshore-based POGOs are subject to franchise tax and income taxes.
Furthermore, the DOF and BIR insisted that Sections 11 (f) and  ( g ) of the Bayanihan 2 Law are not riders.
 “After a judicious review of the allegations raised in the motion for reconsideration, the Court finds the same bereft of merit,” the SC ruled.
 It can be recalled that on September 29, 2022, the Court declared Section 11 (f)  and (g) of the Bayanihan 2 Law  ( An Act Providing for  Covid-19 Response and Recovery Intervention and Providing Mechanism to Accelerate the Recover and Bolster the Resiliency of the Philippine Economy, Providing Funds Therefor, and For Other Purposes ) as unconstitutional for being “riders.”   
ADVERTISEMENTThe decision stemmed from the petition for prohibition  filed by offshore-based gaming operators Saint Wealth Ltd., Marco Polo Enterprises Limited, MG Universal Link Limited,  OG Global Access Limited, Pride Fortune Limited, VIP Global Solutions Limited, AG Interpacific Resources Limited, Wanfang Technology Management Ltd.,  Imperial Choice Limited, Bestbetinnet Limited, Riesling Capital Limited,  Golden Dragon Empire Ltd., Oriental Game Limited, Most Success International Group Limited, and High Zone Capital Investment Group Limited, assailing the constitutional of the said provisions of Bayanihan 2 Law and related revenue issuances of respondents Department of Finance (DOF)  and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).
ADVERTISEMENT
Section 11 (f)  and (g) of the Bayanihan 2 Law   provides a list of sources of fund to address the Covid-19 pandemic which include the amounts derived from the five percent franchise tax on the gross bets from POGOs and income tax, value-added tax and other applicable taxes on income from non-gaming operations earned by POGO operators, agents, service providers and support providers.
In deciding the case, the high court pointed out that the said provisions  violate Section 26, Article VI of the Constitution which mandates that “every bill passed by the Congress shall embrace only one subject which shall be expressed in the title thereof.”
The SC noted  that the prohibition against riders “is to prevent hodge-podge or log-rolling legislation, and to ensure that all provisions of a statute have some reasonable relation to the subject matter as expressed in the title thereof.”
The tribunal noted that respondents – former  BIR Commissioner Caesar Dulay and Former Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III – even admitted that Bayanihan 2 Law is not a tax measure.
Thus, the Court held that the imposition of new taxes, “camouflaged as part of a long list of existing taxes, cannot be contemplated as an integral part of a temporary COVID-19 relief measure.
Consequently, the SC said BIR Revenue Regulation No. 30-2020, Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 64-2020, Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 102-2017 and Revenue Memorandum Circular 78-2018, in so far as they impose franchise tax, income tax and other applicable taxes on off-shore based POGOs, are “null and void for being contrary to the Constitution and other relevant laws.”

11,Senate inclined to grant P1b for NAIA gensets,"byMacon Ramos-Araneta,Maricel Cruzand1 others","May 3, 2023,","Senators appeared to favorably consider a request by the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) for P1billion for the procurement of power generators to serve as power supply backup for the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).
ADVERTISEMENT
Meanwhile, Batangas Rep. Ralph Recto sought a top-to-bottom checkup of the NAIA.
In a related development, the Manila Electric Co. (Meralco) asserted that deploying additional generator sets at the NAIA may not be the best idea to end the recurrent power outages at the country’s premier international airport.
Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri said the government should provide the MIAA the funds needed by the airports.
“Kung anong pondo kailangan, dapat ibigay,” he stressed.
He said an airport is an essential  and strategic facility of the country.
Zubiri earlier asked Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista for a “wish list” to be included in the 2024 budget.
Senate Finance committee chairman Juan Edgardo Angara said the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) should include the airport’s budget when they for inclusion in the proposed General Appropriations Act to be submitted to Malacanang.
Angara described the airports as a “crucial infrastructures.”
For her part, Senate public services committee chairperson Grace Poe said an extra P1- billion was necessary to provide backup power to the airports. She said this could be subsidized through the budget’s unprogrammed funds, or even through the revolving funds from airport operations.
“But the question is- if they knew that the existing backup power can only support 30 percent of the terminals’ power requirement, why did they not propose to procure back-up generators during our budget hearings last year? “ Poe inquired.
ADVERTISEMENT“Clearly, they have been remiss in their duties by not proposing an upgraded back-up system,” she pointed out.
ADVERTISEMENT
She recalled there was a full electrical audit conducted in 2017.
“We would like to know, what were the recommendations?” Poe said.
Why did past and present NAIA administrations fail to comply with the recommended upgrades,” she added.
In seeking the complete checkup of the NAIA, Recto cited the eight-hour power outage that struck facility last, May 1, causing the delay or cancelation of dozens of flights.
“According to the DOTr (Department of Transportation), the NAIA will undergo an electrical system audit. If there are many ailments, why not make it a complete check-up so that we’ll come up with the right cure?,” Recto said.
“And whatever work to be done should be submitted as one package, so the remedies will not be several Band Aid of cures, but a wellness package,” he added.
Recto added that the budget needed to upgrade the NAIA would not be a problem.
“So if the promised power system audit would validate that request, then government should buy it, but not necessarily in the amount floated. Panic buying is the number one procurement sin,” Recto stated.
“May pera naman kasi. NAIA is a corporate profit center for the government. It is not a charity,” he said.
“Even if this light bulb moment had come too late, after the airport had been hit with electrical crashes, it should be treated as an urgent request. Everytime the NAIA is hit with a blackout, the nation gets a black eye,” Recto stressed.
The gross revenues of the MIAA which runs the NAIA was P15.2 billion in 2019, Recto disclosed.
“Since the MIAA is a corporation, it need not seek appropriation authorization from Congress,” Recto noted.
He added Secretary Jimmy Bautista has the experience and the expertise “to undertake NAIA’s urgent to-do-list – the ones which are not cosmetic, but essential.”
For its part, Meralco said providing backup generators for the NAIA was viable.
‘We don’t think it’s the best option. Even if you have a genset and it’s your system that is electrically unsafe or underrated, there is still a chance of power failure. It’s a knee jerk reaction. They should talk to power systems experts,” a Meralco source said.
Meralco officials met with the DOTr on Wednesday for the conduct of an electrical audit, which the power retailer offered to conduct free of charge.
“We will conduct the electrical audit… as to the cause of the power outage last May 1, we reported that it was traced to the busted current transformers inside their own substation serving the parking areas,” the official said.
He said that when the transformer was re-energized around 3:46PM last May 1, it caused another total failure and when it was fully isolated, Terminal 3 went back to normal operations.
The Meralco official said the audit can be done in a couple of weeks, but what was important was implementing the audit findings.
He said Meralco wanted to work with Secretary Bautista, not only with the audit, but also on the needed upgrade or rectifications based on audit results.
“The rectifications may not cost that much,” he said.
Senator Sherwin Gatchalian said the May 1 airport brownout that hit NAIA Terminal 3 caused the cancellation of more than 40 flights, affecting thousands of travelers.
“This incident that happened was not acceptable. This disgusting event happened a few months after the entire air transport system was paralyzed during the New Year,” he said.

“We should have learned our lessons from the New Year incident and appropriate redundancy measures should have been put into place to avoid a repeat of such incident,” Gatchalian said.

12,CA bars opening of five roads in BF Parañaque to public,byRey E. Requejo,"May 3, 2023,","The Court of Appeals (CA) has sustained its earlier decision barring the opening of five gates of the BF Homes in Parañaque to the public.
ADVERTISEMENT
In a 14-page resolution, the CA’s Former Ninth Division denied the motion for reconsideration filed by respondents Human Settlements Adjudication Commission (HSAC) and several individuals seeking the reversal of its October 20, 2022 decision which overturned and set aside a ruling of the HSAC ordering the BF Federation of Homeowners’ Associations Inc. (BFFHAI) to open the gates and allow the entry of vehicles on Aguirre Avenue, Elizalde Street, El Grande Avenue, Concha Cruz Street and  Tropical Street in the BF Homes subdivisions, and to stop imposing entry fees on utility and delivery service providers.
In its appeal, the respondents assailed the CA’s decision as illegal as it amended a previous ruling of the appellate court issued on November 16, 1999 which upheld the local government of Paranaque’s reclassification of the El Grande Avenue and Aguirre Avenue as “commercial areas.”
They asserted that declaring the said roads as “commercial areas,” virtually made these thoroughfares public in nature.
Besides, the respondents maintained that the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction by the HSAC to enjoin BFFHAI from requiring car stickers before allowing the entry of vehicles on the subject roads was justified.
They insisted that the subject roads should be opened because these are being maintained using public funds and that BFFHAI has no authority to sell car stickers.
But the CA held that El Grande and Aguirre avenues remained to be private properties despite their reclassification as commercial areas.
It noted that while the Supreme Court approved the reclassification of the El Grande and Aguirre avenues into commercial areas in a decision issued on February 7, 2007 it did not declare them as public roads.
“Needless to say, however, the reclassification does not automatically open the lands to public use,” the CA ruled.
The appellate court also upheld the authority of BFFHAI to regulate passage through subdivision and village roads under Section 10 (d) Republic Act 9904 or An Act Providing For A Magna Carta For Homeowners and Homeowners’ Association, and For Other Purposes.
The said provision states that an association has the right to “regulate access to, or passage through the subdivision/village roads for purposes of preserving privacy, tranquility, internal security, safety and traffic order.”
ADVERTISEMENT“The perceived inconvenience or moral suffering private respondents may suffer due to BFFHAI’s continuous implementation of the security measures is easily offset by the right of homeowners’ associations (including federations) to set goals for the promotion of safety and security, peace, comfort, and the general welfare of their residents…” the CA said.

“BFFHAI has consistently explained that the fees collected are intended for the salary of their security guards, maintenance of the roads and payment of the real property taxes due,” it added.
The CA also noted that the respondents failed to present evidence to prove that public funds were used to maintain the roads in question.
“Besides, it bears underscoring that the homeowners of the BF Homes Subdivision are still residents of the cities of Parañaque, Las Piñas, and Muntinlupa, as the case may be. Unarguably, they are entitled to avail of the basic services offered by these local government units,” the Appellate Court emphasized.

13,Poe seeks probe on Visayas power crisis; Zubiri favors EPIRA rewrite,byMacon Ramos-AranetaandAlena Mae S. Flores,"May 3, 2023,","Senator Grace Poe seeks an inquiry into the power outages plaguing Panay Island for years now to identify measures that would ensure continuous supply to consumers.

Meanwhile, Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri called on the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) to solve the power crisis in the Visayas, even as he expressed openness to amend the EPIRA (Electric Power Industry Reform Act) if needed.
In another development, Aboitiz Power Corp. said it expected power supply to remain thin, but denied a possible power crisis even as demand continues to go up due to economic rebound.
Poe filed Senate Resolution No. 579, saying it is time to put in place a “long-term solution to the power woes which have been severely impacting on the daily lives of residents and economic activities in the region.”
“Recurring power interruptions and massive blackouts should not be a way of life for our people in Panay Island,” the chairperson of the Senate committee on public services said.
She said concerned agencies must get a handle on the problem to end the intolerable suffering of the residents.
Poe stressed the need to determine the root cause of the distribution problems reported by the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) allegedly due to the tripping of distribution utilities (DUs).
At the same time, the inquiry should delve into the position of electric cooperatives in Panay and Negros pointing to the NGCP as the cause of the problem, Poe said.
An electric cooperative cited a voltage fluctuation and frequency imbalance in the power lines under the management of the NGCP.
“There is an urgent need to determine the root of these grid disturbances, implement remedial measures and determine who shall be held liable to finally put an end to the blame-shifting between NGCP and the DUs, and ascertain possible franchise violations,” Poe said.
“There is also a need to look into the long-term solutions to the power interruptions and outages within the backdrop of the ‘thin’ supply of power in the Visayas grid,” she added.
ADVERTISEMENTZubiri said the DOE and the NGCP must step forward and answer to the consumers this massive blackouts.

If they find the need to amend the EPIRA, Zubiri said they will tackle the amendment.
Since the EPIRA law is over two decades old, he said this can definitely be improved to help the power sector serve consumers better, and to help prevent recurring region-wide blackouts.
“We have received the administration’s suggested amendments to the EPIRA, and we are already studying these. We saw how these amendments can be further refined to best respond to the problems that we are hearing about from the power sector and especially from consumers.
But still, he said, the DOE and the NGCP must come forward with a clear explanation behind the blackouts, and more importantly, outline a solution.
“We cannot let this be the norm. Our people deserve better than this kind of service,” Zubiri said.
Zubiri noted that the power interruptions were “no longer just an inconvenience, but a major problem, affecting the economy and endangering the wellbeing of our people.”
Since late April, Zubiri said Western Visayas was hit by extensive blackouts, at the height of the summer season.
The blackouts, he said, have also led to many smaller businesses cutting down their operating hours.
In February, the region also suffered a power outage that lasted 10 hours, caused by a snake intrusion in the Panay Diesel Power Plant 1, according to the NGCP.
“The frequency of these blackouts is alarming, and it is on the DOE and the NGCP to get their act straight and find long-term solutions already,” said Zubiri
While few minutes of power interruption every once in a while is understandable, but frequent outages that last for hours and hours and cause loss of income is unforgivable.
“Let’s start with energy demand, it has bounced back quite significantly. In fact, we’re seeing record peaks in the last few weeks given the hot weather. Supply and demand margin remained thin,” Aboitiz Power president Emmanuel Rubio said in an interview with ANC.
Rubio said major capacities need to come in by 2024 and 2025 otherwise, supply will remain thin  but “I will not say it is a crisis.”
He said aside from thin supply, power costs remain an issue. “Although some plants that have been mothballed are running or going to run, so the question now would be how much will the power cost be?”
Rubio said, however, that once the Ilijan power plant comes online, which may be cheaper than diesel plants serving peak demand, there will be some improvements in terms of power rates.
“DoE is actually pursuing the investments, coming up with programs to allow investors to actually invest on RE [renewable energy] through GEAP [Green Energy Auction Program] and the deliveries are for 2024, 2025 and they’re quite significant capacity, all of these will help contribute to solve this short-term issue,” he said.
Rubio said liquefied petroleum gas was one of the options to address supply in the short to midterm although it is still expensive.
“Later on, there’s really no other option but to actually build LNG. We have land, that’s why we are actually doing the feasibility studies for our 1,200 MW LNG,” he said.
Rubio also said the proposed LNG plant can meet the base load supply requirement by 2028 to 2030.
Meanwhile, he said his company remains interested in nuclear energy particularly small nuclear reactors.

“We are in continuous discussion with a number of SMR technology providers, I personally believe that SMRs will have a role to play in the Philippine energy setting,” he said.

14,DOJ approves filing of 17 tax cases against QC-based publishing firm,byRey E. Requejo,"May 3, 2023,","The Department of Justice (DOJ) has approved the filing of 17 tax cases against the Quezon City-based Vibal Group, including its chief executive officer, for alleged violations of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC).
ADVERTISEMENT
The DOJ said it issued a resolution indicting Vibal Group, Inc., along with its CEO Kristine Mandigma, and controller Maricel Villas, for violation of Sections 254 (Attempt to Evade or Defeat Tax), and 255 (Failure to File Return, Supply Correct and Accurate Information, Pay Tax, Withhold and Remit Tax and Refund Excess Taxes Withheld on Compensation), in relation to Section 253(d) and Section 256 of the NIRC of 1997.
The DOJ said the cases will be filed before the Regional Trial Court in Quezon City.
The Vibal Group’s core businesses included publishing, printing, systems integration, and technology solutions specialized for education, government, and private enterprise.
“It was discovered that respondent did not pay withholding tax on compensation from March to September 2021, expanded withholding tax from January to September 2021 and final withholding tax on income for the period January to March 2021,” the DOJ said, citing the resolution rendered by the DOJ prosecutors.
“While Vibal group, Inc. filed its returns, it did not pay the taxes,” it added.
The DOJ noted that the Bureau of Internal Revenue sent a collection notice to Vibal Group with an attached list of returns filed without corresponding payments and demanded the immediate settlement of the taxes within ten days from the receipt.
But despite receipt of the documents, Vibal allegedly failed to pay the subject deficiency taxes as of January 3, 2023.
The DOJ said non-payment of the withholding taxes were all “willful and deliberate due to respondent’s act of repeated filing of various returns without payment.”
The DOJ prosecutors also pointed out that Mandigma and Villas were both liable for the cited violations having executed and signed the Statement of Management’s Responsibility for Annual Income Tax Return.
“In the said statement, they categorically admitted and owned responsibility for all information and representations contained in the annual income tax return and in all the other tax returns for the reporting period and affirmed the completeness and correctness in all material respects of respondent Vibal’s audited annual income tax return and financial statements for the year,” DOJ said, stressing that Mandigma and Villas were therefore, both responsible officers of the company.

15,PH seeks duty-free rights in US,byVince LopezandMaricel Cruz,"May 5, 2023","Washington D.C.—President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. on Wednesday (Thursday, Manila time) called for the renewal of the Philippines’ participation in the US Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) trade program, which allowed the duty-free entry of several Philippine products into the United States.
ADVERTISEMENT
The country’s eligibility for the US GSP program expired on Dec. 31, 2020.
“We would like to request reauthorization… to boost trade and to make US products that are made in the Philippines more competitive,” Mr. Marcos said in a speech at a forum organized by the US-ASEAN BusinessCouncil and at a US Chamber of Commerce roundtable and reception at the Blair House in Washington DC.
The program, he said, would increase trade with the US and promote competition.
Aside from strengthening trade relations between the two countries, the President also called on US companies to invest more in the Philippines as the country has stepped up efforts to “create an atmosphere that is attractive to potential investors.”
He told American business executives that the Philippine economy grew 7.6 percent last year.
“This is the effect of our very aggressive efforts really to promote the Philippines as an investment destination,” Marcos said.
“We will never, at any point, say we got it perfected. We will continue to listen to you and to all our other partners as to what else we can do to help transform our economy and, in that way, to be able to play a viable part in the security and defense issues that are the challenges of the day and of the region.”
He noted that the US-Philippines alliance is in the “front and center right now,” overcoming “some bumps and scrapes” over the past years.
“But now, security and defense are top of mind… we also have to see that because our economies and our societies have grown more complex, everything… hinges on everything else and… it is very hard for us to separate and say that this is a discreet sector that does not affect any other sector,” he said.
Marcos also highlighted the government’s efforts to advance the digital transformation of the Philippines, particularly supporting the “smart industry readiness” of several semiconductor and electronics manufacturing services companies “to help them craft their digital transformation road maps.”
ADVERTISEMENTHe also told the American business leaders that Philippines has succeeded in streamlining the process for permits to ensure ease of doing business as he assured them that his administration is working hard to address red tape and the digitalization of bureaucratic processes.

“They have done a very good job. They have reduced some of the permitting procedures from different industries from several months to a just few days,” he said.
“I am really confident that if its continued, if it can continue its work and if it is well supported by legislation, by the bureaucratic procedures, we can cut down many of those unnecessary regulatory documentary requirements,” he added.
The President said the country is also optimistic about the future increase in exports of solar and photovoltaic-related products from the Philippines as many countries strive to comply with their decarbonization targets.
He noted that with the trend toward electric vehicles, Philippine exports geared towards electric vehicle use, such as wire harnesses, rubber tires, and automotive electronics have good potential.
The semiconductor industry, on the other hand, can gain more from increasing skills in research and development, he said.
The President also assured American business leaders that the Philippines will “transform” and not just recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I do not use the word recovery, I use the word transformation. Because we are not trying to recover to where we used to be. We are trying to transform ourselves to be part of the modern world,” Mr. Marcos said.
“Now, that transformation I think will occur and is a grand opportunity that we have been given. Now we do not start from a blank sheet of paper but it’s close [to that]. There are many new sectors that did not exist before. There are businesses that did not exist before that will be very dominant in the very near future,” the President added.
President Marcos said he does not want the Philippines to be back where it was in mid-2019, right before the pandemic hit.
“I want to be somewhere else. I want to be in the middle of the new economy, number one. I think that is important,” he said.
Present at the forum were top American businessmen and Filipino tycoons, among them Jaime Zobel de Ayala, Enrique Razon, Tessie Sy-Coson, and Kevin Tan.
Also on Wednesday, the President met with members of the US Senate to discuss a wide range of issues that include security, defense, agriculture, and climate change mitigation, economic cooperation and cybersecurity.
In his remarks, President Marcos thanked Sen. Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee and other members of the panel for welcoming his delegation to Capitol Hill for the frank and productive discussions on the state of Philippines-US relations.
Having been a member of the Philippine House of Representatives andthe Senate, Marcos said engagements between Manila and Washington should not only take place at the executive but also with members of the legislature.
Marcos noted that defense and security engagement remains the key pillar of Philippines-US bilateral relations. He hailed the US’ willingness to work with the Philippine government “as an equal, sovereign partner.”
The President also expressed the Philippines’ intention to deepen cooperation with the US in the areas of supply chain, health and health security, environment, energy security, and interconnectivity.
The meeting was part of the President’s official visit to Washington, and follows a series of high-level dialogues with US President Joseph Biden and US Vice President Kamala Harris.
Joining the President in the Wednesday Capitol Hill meeting were Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique A. Manalo, Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel G. Romualdez, Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin C. Remulla, and Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual.
Speaker Romualdez said the House is ready to take up the challenge of strengthening the long-standing relations between the Philippines and the United States through engagements of lawmakers of both countries.
“We, at the House of Representatives, welcome the suggestion of President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. that efforts to boost the long-standing bond of friendship between the Philippines and the United States should also involve the respective legislative branches of the two countries,” Romualdez said.

“We are ready to take up that challenge and we look forward to more engagements with our counterparts in the United States in the future,” he added.

16,Do not meddle: China says SCS ’not hunting ground’ for outsiders,byManila Standard,"May 5, 2023","China has rejected what it described as “meddling” by outsiders in the South China Sea, saying it is “not a hunting ground” for forces outside of the region.
ADVERTISEMENT
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning made the statement when asked to comment on the new defense guidelines betwee the Philippines and the US which includes how Washington will defend Manila if it came under attack in the SCS and areas within the Indo-Pacific region.
The official said concerted efforts of countries within the region allowed the situation in the South China Sea to maintain “overall stability.”
“The US-Philippines defense guidelines is a bilateral arrangement,” Mao said. “China firmly opposes any country’s move to meddle in the South China Sea issue to harm China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests by citing the guidelines.”
Mao said the SCS is a “shared home for countries in the region, not a hunting ground for forces outside the region.”
“When regional countries are committed to mutual trust, solidarity, cooperation and properly handling differences, they have in their hand the key to peace and stability in the South China Sea,” Mao said.
Defense OIC Carlito Galvez and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Washington established the new guidelines to modernize bilateral alliance cooperation “for a free and open Indo-Pacific region.”
Under the guidelines, the Philippines and the US will expand cooperation on maritime security through but not limited to joint patrols.
The guidelines also “reaffirmed that an armed attack in the Pacific, including anywhere in the South China Sea, on either of their aircraft or armed forces – which includes their Coast Guards – would invoke mutual defense commitments under the 1951 PH-US Mutual Defense Treaty.”
“Recognizing that threats may arise in several domains—including land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace—and take the form of asymmetric, hybrid, and irregular warfare and gray-zone tactics, the guidelines chart a way forward to build interoperability in both conventional and non-conventional domains,” the fact sheet read.

17,‘Golden Orb’ plan to secure King Charles’ coronation,byAFP,"May 5, 2023,","LONDON—Thousands of police officers, snipers, and cameras will be used this weekend to ensure King Charles III’s coronation passes off without incident.
ADVERTISEMENT
London’s Metropolitan police are spearheading a major security operation —dubbed “Golden Orb”—which will see officers redeployed from around the country to the capital.
The “multi-layered” plan will also feature officers from specialized units including dogs, firearms, and marine support. Police will also use facial recognition technology.
With world leaders and heads of state descending on London, as well as hundreds of thousands of expected visitors, the Met said the security operation would be “one of the most significant and largest” it had ever led.
Among those leaders is President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who left the United States on Thursday (Friday, Manila time) with the First Family to attend the crowning of Britain’s 13th monarch since the political union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland.
The Marcos family’s trip, following the President’s five-day official visit to Washington, is in response to the invitation sent by the United Kingdom to Mr. Marcos as relayed by UK Ambassador Laure Beaufils.
In a statement, Malacañan Palace confirmed the President had accepted the invitation to attend the coronation of the new British sovereign. It was still unclear at press time who in the presidential entourage to the US would accompany the Marcoses to London as well.
The coronation will be held at Westminster Abbey on Saturday (Sunday in Manila), the Presidential Communications Office said.
The PCO said Mr. Marcos and the First Lady accepted the invitation of the Master of the Household, upon command of His Majesty, to a reception at Buckingham Palace on May 5 ahead of the coronation of King Charles and Her Majesty the Queen Consort, Camilla Parker-Bowles.
The President is also expected to meet with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Saturday.
“There will be more than 29,000 police officer deployments over the coming week in the lead up to Coronation Day and over the rest of the Bank Holiday weekend,” the force said in a statement.
ADVERTISEMENTSaturday will see the largest one-day mobilization of officers in decades, with just over 11,500 police on duty, including 2,500 specialist officers.

They will line the processional route, manage crowds and road closures, protect high-profile guests, and carry out searches.
Anti-monarchy group Republic has announced its plans to protest what it calls the “vanity parade.” It is hoping around 1,000 people will turn out to boo the king as he passes Trafalgar Square.
The Met’s Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan told reporters Wednesday the planned demonstration would be “legal” but vowed “very swift action” if the protests became “criminal.”
“We have an extremely low threshold for anybody or anything that will disrupt this event,” he said.
Holding up an anti-monarchy sign is not a criminal act, Adelekan noted, while adding “our priority is around safety and security for everyone.”
Contentious new laws handing police increased powers to curb disruptive protests by climate campaigners and others came into force just this week, leading to accusations they were rushed through ahead of the coronation.
Under the new Public Order Act, protesters who block roads could face up to 12 months in prison.
The Met have also disclosed that they “intend to use facial recognition technology in central London.”
“The watch list will be focused on those whose attendance on Coronation Day would raise public protection concerns,” the force said. That includes those wanted for offenses or with outstanding arrest warrants, the statement added.
Civil liberties organisation Big Brother Watch hit out at the proposed use of what it branded an “authoritarian mass surveillance tool that turns the public into walking ID cards.”
“This Orwellian technology may be used in China and Russia but has no place on the streets of Britain…,” still less during the Coronation, its legal and policy officer Madeleine Stone said.
In addition, snipers will be stationed on some rooftops in central London, while the skies above the British capital will also be closely watched.
No drones or planes are permitted to fly over central London on Saturday, except for police helicopters and authorized media.
According to Philippine Ambassador to the UK Teodoro Locsin Jr., President Marcos personally knew King Charles during his early adulthood, and they even had a chance to play polo together.
Charles became king when his mother Queen Elizabeth II died last September 8. He also took over as head of state of 14 Commonwealth countries, including Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.
Charles Philip Arthur George chose his regnant name Charles III following his ascension to the throne. His mother Queen Elizabeth was the longest-reigning British monarch, which also made him the longest-serving Prince of Wales.
Mr. Sunak is eager to meet President Marcos at the coronation, Ambassador Beaufils said on Tuesday.
The British envoy said they were working on setting up a meeting between the two leaders on Saturday, the day of the coronation, but nothing had been finalized.

“We hope so. The Prime Minister said that he would very much like to meet President Marcos so we’re in the process of trying to make that happen. We very much hope that the meeting will take place Saturday and we think it’s likely to take place on Saturday,” she added. With Vince Lopez

18,"BuCor: Face mask, antigen test for visitors as COVID cases hike",byMacon Ramos-AranetaandMaricel Cruz,"May 5, 2023,","As COVID-19 is spreading anew, individuals visiting the offices of the Bureau of Corrections and the New Bilibid Prison are required to wear face masks and present negative rapid antigen test results.
ADVERTISEMENT
This comes amid the increase of COVID cases at the NBP and Correctional Institution for Women.
With the shift in testing protocols to focus more on symptomatic individuals, the Department of Health is bracing for a continuing rise in the COVID-19 positivity rate.
DOH Officer-in-Charge Dr. Maria Rosario Vergeire stressed that with this shift, those tested are most likely to be positive for the coronavirus disease.
Vergeire also said the positivity rate is not the sole criterion in monitoring the country’s COVID-19 situation.
She also allayed concerns from legislators on the reported increase in local COVID-19 cases.
During the hearing of the House Committee on Appropriations on the budgetary performance of the DOH, Vergeire told the panel the department is prevented from purchasing bivalent COVID-19 vaccines, which targets Omicron COVID-19 and its subvariants, due to an absence of a law authorizing such.
On the rising COVID cases, Vergeire said over 90 percent of the new infections being recorded daily are “mild and asymptomatic cases.”
“We’re averaging around 822 cases per day. This is about 79 percent higher than the previous two weeks of cases,” Vergeire told the House appropriations panel chaired by Ako Bicol Party-list Rep. Zaldy Co.
“Most of these cases are mild and asymptomatic cases. We will have about 8 to 9 percent of those with COVID that are classified as severe and critical,” she said.
Metro Manila’s weekly COVID-19 positivity rate rose to 19.7 percent as of May 2, according to pandemic monitor OCTA Research, as its fellow Dr. Guido David said Wednesday night the latest positivity rate increased by 7 points from 12.7 recorded on April 25.
ADVERTISEMENT“This could go as high as 25 percent,” he warned in a tweet on the positivity rate, or the percentage of tests turning out positive for the coronavirus. (See full story online at manilastandard.net)
ADVERTISEMENT
The World Health Organization recommends a 5-percent threshold for COVID-19 positivity rate.
Hospital occupancy in Metro Manila also increased to 24.7 percent on May 2 from 22.5 percent on April 25, Guido noted.
Infections surged in the past weeks due to increased mobility, waning immunity and more contagious COVID-19 variants, he told ABS-CBN News.
BuCor Health and Services Acting Director Dra. Ma. Cecilia Villanueva said that out of the 577 persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) tested this week, a total of 55 PDLs tested positive for the virus. Of this, 30 had mild symptoms while 22 were asymptomatic.
The agency said one Bucor personnel also tested positive for COVID-19, as the bureau said the first batch of 32 PDLs who tested positive must undergo a rapid antigen test on Friday before they can be discharged.
“We will continue to undertake contact tracing just to make sure that our personnel and PDLs are safe,” Villanueva said in a statement.
Visitation privileges, meanwhile, remain suspended.
“There are many factors or measures to consider as to an area’s increase in COVID-19 cases,” Vergeire said. “This means the metrics such as transmission rate, contact rate, and longer durations of infectiousness are not sole drivers of transmission and increases in cases.”
The DOH OIC said they must keep an eye on the healthcare utilization rates and monitor the situation on hospital admission.
She further cited the need to emphasize other factors such as layers of protection — mask wearing based on individual risk assessment, isolating when sick, and vaccination for the primary series and getting boosted.
Former National Task Force vs. COVID-19 adviser, public health expert Dr. Anthony Leachon, noted that while hospital occupancy remains low, it is increasing gradually. Although cases of COVID-19 infections are low, “we cannot predict the future,” he added.
He attributed the surge in the coronavirus cases to the new subvariant XBB 1.16 known as Arcturus, the wanning wall of immunity, the increase in mobility, complacency of people and the optional masking.
The WHO urged the public to make safe choices and assess the risk to help prevent infection as it acknowledged the rise in COVID-19 cases in the region.
If possible, WHO said, office meetings should be held online to protect oneself against coronavirus infection.
“When meeting in person, practice COVID-19 protective measures,” added WHO.
Meanwhile, Vergeire said that the absence of a law allowing the DOH to purchase bivalent Covid-19 vaccines explains why the DOH “is not very active” in pursuing the procurement of the vaccines.
Vergeire raised the issue upon a query from Marikina Rep. Stella Luz Quimbo, the House appropriations panel senior vice chairperson.
“Why is that we are not very active in procuring bivalent COVID-19 vaccines and we are depending on donation. As it is, our healthcare workers remain vulnerable because they are not yet protected,” Quimbo said.
In response, Vergeire said: “We just like to mention and emphasize that we did all things possible. Unfortunately, procurement is a non-option for us right now because of the existing laws in the country.”
“We don’t have a basis to do procurement as stated in provisions required by manufacturers for us to be able to enter agreements with them. We opted for donations at this point because we do not have a policy for us to go through the procurement process. The state of calamity was lifted, and because of that, our COVID-19 Vaccination law is already not valid,” she added.
Vergeire said the government has the money intended to purchase bivalent COVID-19 vaccines.
“We have a budget from our [COVID-19] loans, that is why we did not include it in the General Appropriations Act proposal,” she said.

Quimbo, for her part, committed that Congress is ready to pass a law for the procurement of bivalent COVID-19 vaccines. “If there is a need to pass the law, the Congress is open to it, we will find ways to help you.”

19,PBBM: Whole-of-gov’t fight vs. crimes,byVince Lopez,"May 5, 2023,","President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has signed a memorandum circular directing all government agencies and encouraging local government units to support the 2023 National Crime Prevention Program (NCPP).
ADVERTISEMENT
The President said the directive is in line with the adoption of a “whole-of-government” approach in addressing criminality, and ensuring peace and security in the country.
The 2023 NCPP puts into practice the strategies for ensuring peace and security under the Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028 with the National Police Commission (Napolcom) at the helm of NCPP implementation.
The 2023 NCPP was developed by Napolcom through its Technical Committee on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, an inter-disciplinary body composed of acknowledged experts from government agencies and non-government organizations involved in the criminal justice system.
Napolcom is an agency attached to the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) responsible for the administration and control of the Philippine National Police.
On Thursday, a ranking police official said the country’s crime rate dropped by 11.36 percent in the first three months of the year.
In a Laging Handa briefing, Philippine National Police (PNP) PublicInformation Office chief Col. Redrico Maranan said a total of 12,226 crime incidents were recorded from Jan. 1 to May 2, compared to 13,763 crimes in the same period last year.
“We were able to reduce 1,500 plus crimes of the so-called eight focus crimes. That’s why we see, our different anti-criminality strategies, we see that it is effective,” he added.
The eight focus crimes are murder, homicide, physical injury, robbery, theft, vehicle theft, motorcycle theft and rape.
Index crimes are serious crimes such as murder, homicide, physical injury, robbery, rape, theft, and carjacking, while non-index crimes are violations of local ordinances and laws and vehicular accidents.
Maranan said that under PNP chief Gen. Benjamin Acorda Jr.’s leadership, the PNP will deploy policemen in barangays identified by the local police forces as crime-prone areas as part of preemptive efforts against criminality. (See full story online at manilastandard.net)
ADVERTISEMENT“The focus of our new PNP chief, Gen. Acorda, is to assign police tocrime-prone barangays. We have already identified that and that will be the priority of our deployment… in the crime-prone barangays. And we have also identified police regional offices that will be the ones to lead in their area of responsibility,” he added.

Maranan earlier said the move is a strategic action plan as the national police do not have enough manpower to guard over 100 million Filipinos across the country.
Maranan explained that police visibility has been proven as a crime deterrent over the years.
He emphasized the importance of the cooperation of the barangay officials in maintaining peace and order.
He said that strong coordination between the police and the community lies on the cooperation between the two, adding that it is the police commanders who are given the task to initiate it.
“The PNP cannot deploy policemen in each of the barangay. What we do is to cluster the barangay and then we either put up Police Community Precincts, police assistance desks or even a police outpost. We believe that if this is properly implemented, we would be able to reduce crime, especially in the crime-prone barangays,” he added.

The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) already completed its initial “corrective maintenance activity” on Wednesday (May 3) and said it “went smoothly.”
“The maintenance work on the Automatic Voltage Regulator was completed at around 0327H without disruption,” said CAAP spokesperson Eric Apolonio.
The repair work on May 3 included the removal of panel covers, replacement, testing and calibration, cleaning and closing of the front panel cover and side panel covers.
Apolonio said the next maintenance work at the Air Traffic Management Center (ATMC) may affect operations of major airports, particularly the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, because it will be done from midnight until 6 a.m. on May 17.
The ATMC houses the Communications, Navigations, Surveillance / Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) system which manages and supervises the air traffic activities within the Philippine Flight Information Region (FIR).
The ATMS power supply upgrade will involve the installation of a bypass panel to provide seamless ATMS operation and the reconfiguration of the existing distribution panel to segregate ATM system A (voice) and ATM system B (data), resulting in the UPS and AVR serving as each other’s backup in case the other power supply encounters a problem.

Canceled flights include those flying from Manila to Davao, Cebu, and Bacolod and their corresponding return flights, which cover the six-hour repair of ATMS.
Air Asia Communications and Public Affairs Country head Steve Dailisan said the repair of the CNS-ATM system is a positive development towards ensuring safer skies for all.

“We seek your kind understanding as PAL works with the authorities to minimize the impact on our customers. The government is undertaking this preventive maintenance work as part of a permanent upgrading and improvement of the country’s air navigational radar systems. Your safety remains our top priority,” PAL said in a statement.
The CAAP described the activity as a “preemptive measure to prevent the repeat of New Year’s Day shutdown of the country’s airspace.”
The maintenance activity will mainly affect flights at the NAIA, the Clark International Airport, and the Mactan-Cebu International Airport, and several flights at the other 42 CAAP commercially operated airports.
But Bataan Rep. Geraldine Roman called on the authorities to reconsider their plan to shut down Philippine airspace for six hours on May 17.
“I’m sure we have many experts who can install that system without affecting passengers,” Roman said in a mix of English and Filipino.
Roman expressed concern that the closure would mostly affect budget airlines’ promotions, which offer cheaper fares during the late hours.
She also highlighted the possible negative effects of the closure on subsequent flights and tourism during the summer.
Roman also raised her concern about the recent power outages at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 3. She said such power outages, which inconvenienced passengers and disrupted airport operations, should not happen again.

Roman supports an investigation into the root cause of the outages and has urged authorities to take necessary steps to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

The polymer thousand-peso bill is the first Philippine banknote to win the award. It won over banknote finalists from Algeria, Barbados, Egypt, Northern Ireland, and Scotland.
In announcing the award, the IBNS said: “The Philippines’ successful design in eye-pleasing blue combines an endangered species with an environmental motif.”
IBNS is a global non-profit organization that recognizes exceptional banknotes issued each year on the basis of artistic merits, such as design and use of colors, as well as high-quality security features.
The obverse side of the 1,000-Piso polymer banknote showcases the Philippine Eagle, which symbolizes the Filipino people’s uniqueness, strength, power, love for freedom, and sharp vision. It also features the national flower, Sampaguita, which represents purity, simplicity, humility, and strength.
The bill’s reverse side showcases the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site; the T’nalak weave design of the T’boli people; and the South Sea Pearl.
The BSP began circulating the award-winning banknote in April 2022. It was printed by Note Printing Australia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Australia’s central bank.

22,‘We’ll have your back in SCS’,byVince Lopez,"May 4, 2023,","Washington—The United States “will always have the Philippines’ back” in the South China Sea or elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin assured President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Wednesday (Thursday in Manila).

“So make no mistake Mr. President, we will always have your back in the South China Sea or elsewhere in the region,” Austin said to Mr. Marcos, who met with the top American defense officials at The Pentagon, the US Defense Department’s headquarters.
The US and the Philippines are also moving toward real-time sharing of military information and greater coordination to guard against any coercive behavior by China in the South China Sea and around Taiwan, according to a fact sheet released by the Pentagon.
The fact sheet covered the US-Philippine defense cooperation guidelines Wednesday after US President Joe Biden and Mr. Marcos adopted them following their meeting at the White House this week.
In reply to Austin, President Marcos said that the background “of the strengthening relationship between our two countries, strengthening what is already has begun, is a longstanding and very robust relationship that we have developed over the many years.”
Mr. Marcos also looked forward to “a very bright future between the Philippines and the United States.”
“And so, Mr. Secretary, I look forward… to a future that is founded on the long experience, and as you say, friendship and familial relationship because the people-to-people exchanges between our two countries have been ongoing at this very level,” he said.
Mr. Marcos is in the US for a four-days official working visit in which he met his American counterpart and discussed national and regional matters.
The rare visit by a foreign leader to the US Department of Defense indicates the urgency and resolve of both sides to increase defense cooperation.
Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder stressed in a news briefing Tuesday that Washington and Manila are “standing at a transformational moment,” adding that Austin and Mr. Marcos discussed “a wide range of security topics” including expansion of operational cooperation in the South China Sea.
According to the fact sheet, the guidelines are intended to “foster a common understanding of roles, missions, and capabilities within the framework of the alliance to face regional and global security challenges.”
ADVERTISEMENTWashington and Manila agreed to conclude by the end of 2023 an intel-sharing framework, known as a General Security of Military Information Agreement, when they held a two-plus-two meeting of foreign affairs and defense leaders – Austin and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken with Philippines Defense OIC Carlito Galvez and Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo — in April.

The GSOMIA is meant to exchange sophisticated military intelligence in a timely manner, and the two sides are expected to finalize details of the agreement in working-level talks.
In the South China Sea, Chinese Coast Guard ships have continued aggressive maneuvers in the Spratly Islands around Ayungin Shoal, also known as Second Thomas Shoal, where both Beijing and Manila claim sovereignty.
A better understanding of the locations and movements of Chinese ships gleaned through real-time intelligence sharing would help the Philippines safely execute resupply missions to the naval ship BRP Sierra Madre, which was deliberately grounded on Second Thomas Shoal in 1999 to reinforce Manila’s territorial claims.
The US and the Philippines will work to enhance maritime and security awareness in the South China Sea by conducting “combined maritime activities” such as joint patrols.
A senior US defense official told Nikkei Asia in a report that “we think preserving their rights to operate within an EEZ [exclusive economic zone] in accordance with international laws is something that’s really important.”
Adm. Samuel Paparo, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, also accused Beijing of repeated interdictions of Philippine ships operating in Manila’s EEZ during a recent interview with Nikkei.
Paparo issued warnings to China that US Navy ships “stand ready” to support the Philippine operations with an eye on potential collisions between Beijing and Manila.
The defense guidelines direct the US and Philippine militaries to increase interoperability across land, sea, air, space, and the cyber domain. They will intensify efforts to tackle gray zone operations and irregular warfare.
China is consolidating effective control over the South China Sea by deploying militia groups and civilian ships so as not to go beyond the threshold of military confrontation.
President Marcos was given arrival honors by the United States Armed Forces as he met with the US military top brass and the Philippine delegation.
Austin reminded the President of the “enduring strength” of the PH-US alliance and the shared commitment of the two countries.
“For decades, the Philippines has been an indispensable friend and ally to the United States,” he said.
Austin also acknowledged the recent “Balikatan” exercises of the American and Filipino troops, the largest-ever edition of the annual military drills, which included thousands of soldiers from the US, the Philippines, and their allies.
“The recently concluded largest and most complex iteration ever of Exercise Balikatan included more than 17,000 troops in the Philippines, the United States, and Australia, training side-by-side across air, land, sea, and for the first time, cyberspace,” the US Defense chief said to President Marcos.
Austin also reiterated the commitment made by Mr. Biden to Mr. Marcos for the defense of the Philippines.
“President Biden has made clear our commitment to the defense of the Philippines is ironclad,” the secretary said.

“Our Mutual Defense Treaty applies to armed attacks on our armed forces, coast guard vessels, public vessels, or aircraft in the Pacific, including anywhere in the South China Sea,” he added.

23,100 Chinese ships continue to swarm Julian Felipe Reef—PCG,byCharles DantesandRey E. Requejo,"May 4, 2023,","A week after they were first spotted, over 100 suspected Chinese maritime militia (CMM) vessels were still anchored in the West Philippine Sea, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) reported on Wednesday.
ADVERTISEMENT
In a public briefing, PCG spokesperson for West Philippine Sea, Commodore Jay Tarriela said the CMM ships have been sighted in the Julian Felipe Reef since April 22.
“There are still more than 100 Chinese maritime militia in Julian Felipe (Reef),” Tarriela said.
Two Chinese coast guard ships roaming in Ayungin Shoal since April 23 were still lingering in the area.
The PCG reported on April 28 the sighting of more than 100 militia ships during their weeklong maritime patrol in the West Philippine Sea.
The PCG said Chinese vessels were showing aggressive tactics through radio challenges asking Philippine patrol vessels to leave several times and executing dangerous maneuvers that led to a near collision between a PCG ship and a Chinese coast guard vessel.
In July 2016, the UN Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague invalidated the nine-dash claims of China covering the entire South China Sea and recognized the Philippines’ sovereign rights in the area within its 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone.
Beijing has been ignoring the international ruling and deployed hundreds of militia vessels to harass local fishermen and other boats.
The United States has urged China to respect freedom of navigation and honor the 2016 arbitral ruling.
US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Kritenbrink expressed Washington’s deep concern on China’s “continued intimidation and harassment of Philippine vessels” after its coast guard once again made a dangerous maneuver against its Filipino counterpart.
On April 19 and 23, Chinese vessels had blocked the path of Philippine vessels on patrol mission in the Ayungin Shoal, which led to a near collision between the two ships.
ADVERTISEMENTDuring an online press conference on Wednesday morning (Manila time), Kritenbrink said that such actions and behavior were “truly unacceptable” and the US “will continue to track and monitor those interactions.”
ADVERTISEMENT
“The best way to prevent such instances in the future would be for the PRC (People’s Republic of China) to make a commitment to uphold the rules-based international order,” Kritenbrink said.
The US official also called on Beijing to respect the “freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and to abide by the 2016 Arbitral Tribunal ruling which of course is binding on both parties.”
“We again call upon Beijing to desist from its provocative and unsafe conduct,” Kritenbrink said.
He said the US would continue regularly operating in the contested waterway to “demonstrate the principle that all countries should be able to, or are able to fly, sail and operate anywhere where international law allows.”
With a strengthened military alliance between Washington and Manila, the US official also said it was “somewhat puzzling” for China to claim that the Western giant is dragging Manila into conflict in the Taiwan Strait.
Kritenbrink emphasized that the US and the Philippines “share vision for a peaceful and stable region,” so it is concerning for him why China would make such a claim.
“We support the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. We oppose unilateral efforts to change the status quo by either side and we insist that cross-strait differences be resolved peacefully,” he said.

24,US trip yields over $1.1b in investment pledges,byVince LopezandOthel V. Campos,"May 4, 2023,","American companies—including those involved in pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, solar power and business process outsourcing–committed to invest more than $1.1 billion in the Philippines and told visiting President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. they were eager to tap the country’s “critical mix of talent and global business service expertise.”
ADVERTISEMENT
Executives from pharmaceutical and biotechnology leader Moderna, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, told President Marcos they intended to set up a vaccine-making facility in the Philippines during a meeting with Filipino officials at Blair House in Washington DC.
Moderna Chief Commercial Officer Arpa Garay and Senior Vice President and General Manager Patrick Bergstedt said they are set to establish a shared service facility, their third in the world.
Garay said the shared service in the Philippines will serve the entire Asia Pacific Region. She underscored they want to explore further the successful public-private partnership between the Philippine government and Moderna.
“We are really excited to have selected the Philippines for the third one primarily because you know the capabilities exist. We have the talent that exists, and we know that the partnership will be one that can be beneficial for both Moderna and the Philippines,” Garay said.
Bergstedt said there are other countries that offered shared services with Moderna but they have chosen the Philippines as the “perfect location” for their third shared service facility in the world.
Moderna was among the pharmaceutical companies that pioneered the production of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which were distributed to the Philippines at the height of the pandemic.
Marcos met with the Moderna executives on Tuesday afternoon (Wednesday, Manila time) at the Blair House in Washington DC along with former president and now Senior Deputy Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Speaker Martin Romualdez, Trade and Industry Secretary Alfredo Pascual and Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno.
Special Assistant to the President Secretary Antonio Ernesto Lagdameo Jr., Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez and DTI Undersecretary Ceferino Rodolfo were also present during the meeting.
Once operational, it will be Moderna’s only shared service facility in Asia and the third in the world following Poland and the United States.
It is expected to employ about 50 health professionals.
ADVERTISEMENT“We are pleased to expand our footprint into the Philippines by establishing an enterprise solutions hub and commercial operations,” Moderna Chief Executive Stéphane Bancel said in announcing the investment plan. “The Philippines has a critical mix of talent and global business service expertise, which makes it an excellent location to scale efficiently and provide regional support.”

Moderna plans to begin operations in the Philippines in the second or third quarter of 2023.
At the same time, the President welcomed the plan of Analog Devices Inc. (ADI) to invest $200 million to build a new R&D facility to add to its semiconductor plant in the Gateway Business Park in Cavite.
During a meeting with the President, ADI executives said they have continued to increase the level of technology that’s been introduced, and are setting up a 300-mm Center of Excellence in Cavite, which is doing all of the company’s wafer programs.
Established in 1965, ADI is a global semiconductor leader.
In August 2021, ADI announced the completion of its acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., strengthening its position as a high-performance analog semiconductor company.
ADI’s Philippine counterpart, Analog Devices General Trias, Inc. (ADGTI), engages in the manufacture, assembly, testing and inspection of semiconductor devices.
As of 2022, ADGTI has 5,252 employees, with a total of $394.39 million worth of exports for the same year.
Solar company Maxeon, meanwhile, said it will invest some $900 million (P49.8 billion) in solar energy in the Philippines, while American health care services provider Optum will invest some P800 million in medical business process outsourcing (BPO) in the Philippines.
Bill Mulligan, CEO of Maxeon, which operates the SunPower brand in all global markets, said the investment will provide more than 3,000 jobs in the next few years.
Mulligan said the reason for the expansion efforts is the company’s confidence in the administration of President Marcos, as he looks forward to expanding the engagement with the Philippine government.
“The Philippines has been incredibly important… it’s actually a strategic part of our company. And I want to thank you and I want to thank all of the government agencies for all of the help and the support for the 40 plus years that we’ve been in the country,” Mulligan said.
Mulligan said they are starting the expansion of their R&D facility in Cavite, providing around 2,000 engineering jobs in the area.
Maxeon has been operating in the Philippines since 2003 and opened its first factory at the Laguna Technopark in Biñan City in 2004.
Meanwhile, Optum’s P800 million medical BPO investment is set to employ some 1,500 Filipinos.
John Prince, president and COO of Optum, said the firm is committed to the Philippines and lauded the “strategic partnership that we have for a very long time.”
“I’m a really big believer that great things happen to great teams and we have a great team in the Philippines,” Prince said.
In March this year, Optum met with the Board of Investments (BOI) to discuss details of their planned new project in Davao and queries on the importation of equipment.
Since 2011, UHG/Optum has invested P5.1 billion in capital expenditure in operating four sites in Taguig, Muntinlupa, Quezon City and Cebu City.
In a separate meeting, the President welcomed the decision of BPO company Atento to set up its first call center in the Philippines at the Iloilo Business Park in Madurriao, Iloilo.
President Marcos told Atento officials that they made the right decision in choosing the Philippines as their location as “Filipinos speak and write the best English.”
“I know it will be successful because it has been successful in the past. It has been a go-to industry for the Philippine government for quite a long time now,” Mr. Marcos said.
President Marcos met with Atento President Fili Ledezma Soto and Chief Delivery Officer Josh Ashby at the Blair House as part of his official trip to the US.
Atento officials assured the President and the Philippine government officials of their commitment to start their call center in Iloilo.
Atento is a customer relationship management and business process outsourcing company operating in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Morocco, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Spain, Uruguay and the US.
Atento is projected to provide employment opportunities for around 554 workers in the first year and 665 workers in the second year, bringing in an investment of P21.4 million.
Also on Tuesday, a seafaring industry executive told President Marcos that US firms are set to hire some 75,000 Filipino seafarers in the next three to four years. John Padget, president and CEO of Carnival Corp. said his group of companies is set to hire the Filipino seafarers and praised Filipino workers for their hospitality and competitiveness in the global workforce.
“It doesn’t matter whether it’s the marine, deck, hospitality, restaurant…everything is based on the happiness, the smile, and the greatness of the Filipino employees,” he said.
President Marcos thanked the US employers for their continued confidence in Filipino professionals and skilled workers.
Meanwhile, an organization of prominent Filipino and American civic and business leaders vowed greater cooperation and partnership in the development and Philippine economy.
The United States-Philippines Society, co-chaired by Ambassador John D. Negropotente, made the commitment following the group’s meeting with President Marcos.
Negroponte, who was US ambassador to Manila from 1993 to 1996, said Marcos’ visit to Washington laid the framework for the commitment of the group to support the Philippines.
“(The) President’s visit… sets the table for our work…in the months and years ahead. Thank you for that,” Negroponte told President Marcos.
Also known as The Society, the USPS is a non-profit, bi-national organization of prominent civic and business leaders of the US and the Philippines.
The Society was organized in May 2012 with the aim of enhancing and awareness of the profile of the Philippines in the United States in the areas of security, trade, investments, tourism, the environment, history, education and culture.
Negroponte noted the positive developments of President Marcos’ meeting with US President Joseph Biden last Monday.
Michael DiPaula Coyle, head of international trade policy government and regulatory affairs of IBM, a member of the US-PH Society, said they are “very, very bullish” on the Philippine economy and look forward to working with the government to invest in digitalization.
“We’re also very heavily invested in helping grow your talent pool through skills development programs,” Coyle said. “We’ve had a number of partnerships with the US government with your government to improve skills development particularly in areas like… AI and cybersecurity where I think the Philippines has an enormous opportunity to position yourselves as very competitive economy particularly in the IT services sector.”
Speaker Romualdez said the hard work of the President has paid off with investments that would boost the Philippine economy and create jobs for thousands of Filipinos.
This developed following a series of engagements that the President and his delegation held in Washington D.C. with various leading US firms on the third day of his official visit to the US.

“It is heartening to note that the President’s mission to the US has scored significant gains that would not only spur further economic growth but more importantly, result in direct benefits for thousands of Filipino workers in terms of job created,” Romualdez said.

The First Family’s trip, following the President’s five-day official visit to the US, is in response to the invitation sent by the United Kingdom to Mr. Marcos as relayed by UK Ambassador Laure Beaufils.
In a statement, Malacañan Palace confirmed the President had accepted the invitation for his attendance at the coronation of the new British sovereign. It was still unclear at presstime who in the presidential entourage to the US would accompany the Marcoses to London as well.
The coronation will be held at Westminster Abbey on Saturday (Sunday in Manila), the Presidential Communications Office said.
The PCO said Mr. Marcos and the First Lady accepted the invitation of the Master of the Household, upon command of His Majesty, to a reception at Buckingham Palace on May 5 ahead of the coronation of King Charles and Her Majesty the Queen Consort, Camilla Parker-Bowles.
A trip to Indonesia soon follows for Mr. Marcos as he attends the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit.
The trip slated from May 10 to 11 is upon the invitation of ASEAN chair Indonesian President Joko Widodo, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).
The Palace has yet to release the list of the people who will be accompanying the President and the First Lady to the UK.
According to Philippine Ambassador to the UK Teodoro Locsin Jr., President Marcos personally knew King Charles during his early adulthood, and they even had a chance to play polo together.
Charles became king when his mother Queen Elizabeth II died last September 8. He also took over as head of state of 14 Commonwealth countries, including Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.
Charles Philip Arthur George chose his regnant name Charles III following his ascension to the throne. His mother Queen Elizabeth was the longest-reigning British monarch, which also made him the longest-serving Prince of Wales.
ADVERTISEMENTUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is eager to meet President Marcos at the coronation, Ambassador Beaufils said on Tuesday.

The British envoy said they were working on setting up a meeting between the two leaders on Saturday, the day of the coronation, but nothing had been finalized.
“We hope so. The Prime Minister said that he would very much like to meet President Marcos so we’re in the process of trying to make that happen. We very much hope that the meeting will take place Saturday and we think it’s likely to take place on Saturday,” she added.
In a media briefing on Friday, Angelito Nayan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the DFA-Office of ASEAN Affairs, said Mr. Marcos is expected to “assert the importance of demonstrating ASEAN centrality in the region amid geopolitical rivalries.”
The Chief Executive is also seen to advance the Philippines’ priorities in ASEAN by boosting cooperation in various areas such as food and energy security, economic recovery, and protection of migrant workers, among others.
“One of the important outcomes of this summit is the leaders’ declaration on combatting trafficking in persons caused by the use and misuse of technology,” Nayan said.
“This is something that the Philippines fully supports — owing to our advocacy in ASEAN on the protection of migrant workers, and the Philippines’ role as lead shepherd for ASEAN cooperation against trafficking,” he added.

26,4 million kilos of smuggled sugar to be sold cheap at Kadiwa stores,byMacon Ramos-Araneta,"May 4, 2023,","At least 4,000 metric tons or 4 million kilos of seized smuggled sugar were approved to be sold at Kadiwa outlets at a cheaper price, the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) said on Wednesday.
ADVERTISEMENT
At the televised public briefing, SRA acting administrator Pablo Luis Azcona said the sugar will be sold at P70 per kilo.
“We still have an additional 6,000 MT confiscated sugar. Hopefully, it will also be released once it is proven safe and approved for sale, for donation to Kadiwa,” he added.
Meanwhile, Sen. Risa Hontiveros slammed those behind the spike in sugar price to P136 per kilo as “robbing the consumers.”
She said Malacanang, the Department of Agriculture, and SRA’s Azcona should know the reason for the spike since “they created the sugar cartel.”
“This is not just ‘tubong lugaw’ (profit far exceeding investment) but outright robbery of consumers across the country who are being forced to carry this with the help of corruption and mismanagement,” Hontiveros said.
The senator said the local sugar refineries or azucarera had already sold their supply to traders, and that according to former SRA Administrator Rafael Coscolluela, this should have lowered the cost of sugar from P86 to P90 per kilo.
And since 170,000 metric tons of sugar from All Asian Countertrade, Sucden Philippines and Edison Lee Marketing have entered the market, Hontiveros said sugar can be sold in the market at P70 per kilo without losses for retailers.
“So instead of the price of sugar going down, why the increase?” she asked, while lambasting the additional P40 to P60 passed on to Filipinos.
“It appears that retailers, food producers, traders, wholesalers and the market are taking their cues from the favored importers and their irregularities,” the senator added.
Wholesalers, she said, may be aligning their price offers with those of the cartel.
ADVERTISEMENTHontiveros said food producers, traders and retailers were forced to buy sugar even at high prices “because there’s no other source.”
ADVERTISEMENT
They are also fearful of running out of stocks “because rumors are rife that Sucden (Philippines Inc., an importer and distributor) does not have enough capital to import the 100,000 metric tons assigned to them,” she added.
“Are retail price controls the solution? Not if they’re not the ones who padded the unbelievably high prices. This would probably result in a greater lack of supply of sugar in our retail markets,” the senator said.
It should be remembered, Hontiveros said, that apart from the earlier imports, Sugar Order No. 6 obligated the three government-approved importers to buy 440,000 metric tons of sugar from local suppliers.
“This means that the cartel can control almost 880,000 metric tons of sugar, which will surely be sold at high prices to the public. That’s part of the market’s fears,” she said.
Instead of price control on sugar retail prices, the senator said the government should focus on price monitoring and control for wholesale purchases, “because that’s where the powerful cartels can dictate prices.”
Hontiveros noted that about 260,000 metric tons need to be imported from Thailand to reach the supply the country needs.
“The SRA should act now and give import licenses to qualified importers as provided by Sugar Order No. 6. We hope the government moves now before sugar supplies fall even more, leading to a higher spike in prices,” she said.

27,Brace for new heat records: UN raises alert on El Niño by July,byAFPandRio N. Araja,"May 4, 2023,","The United Nations warned Wednesday of a growing likelihood the weather phenomenon El Nino will develop in coming months, fueling higher global temperatures and possibly new heat records.
ADVERTISEMENT
The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said it now estimated there was a 60-percent chance that El Nino would develop by the end of July, and an 80-percent chance it would do so by the end of September.
“This will change the weather and climate patterns worldwide,” Wilfran Moufouma Okia, head of WMO’s regional climate prediction services division, told reporters in Geneva.
El Nino, which is a naturally occurring climate pattern typically associated with increased heat worldwide, as well as drought in some parts of the world and heavy rains elsewhere, last occurred in 2018-19.
Since 2020 though, the world has been hit with an exceptionally long La Nina — El Nino’s cooling opposite — which ended earlier this year, ceding way to the current neutral conditions.
And yet, the UN has said the last eight years were the warmest ever recorded, despite La Nina’s cooling effect stretching over nearly half that period.
Without that weather phenomenon, the warming situation could have been even worse.
Global heating spikes likely
La Nina “acted as a temporary brake on global temperature increase,” WMO chief Petteri Taalas said in a statement.
Now, he said, “the world should prepare for the development of El Nino.”
The expected arrival of the warming climate pattern, he said, “will most likely lead to a new spike in global heating and increase the chance of breaking temperature records.”
ADVERTISEMENTAt this stage, there is no indication of the strength or duration of the looming El Nino.
ADVERTISEMENT
The last one was considered very weak, but the one before that, between 2014 and 2016, was considered among the strongest ever, with dire consequences.
WMO pointed out that 2016 was “the warmest year on record because of the ‘double whammy’ of a very powerful El Nino event and human-induced warming from greenhouse gases”.
Since the El Nino effect on global temperatures usually plays out the year after it emerges, the impact will likely be most apparent in 2024, it said.
“We are expecting in the coming two years to have a serious increase in the global temperatures,” Okia said.
More extreme weather
Taalas highlighted that the expected arrival of El Nino could have some positive effects, pointing out that it “might bring respite from the drought in the Horn of Africa and other La Nina-related impacts”.
But it “could also trigger more extreme weather and climate events” he said, stressing the need for effective early warning systems “to keep people safe.”
No two El Nino events are the same and their effects depend, in part, on the time of year, WMO said, adding that it and national meteorological services would be closely monitoring developments.
The climate pattern occurs on average every two to seven years, and usually lasts nine to 12 months.
It is typically associated with warming ocean surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.
Increased rainfall is usually seen in parts of southern South America, the southern United States, the Horn of Africa and central Asia, while severe droughts can occur over Australia, Indonesia and parts of southern Asia.
During summer in the northern hemisphere, El Nino’s warm water can also fuel hurricanes in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, while hindering hurricane formations in the Atlantic Basin, WMO said.
Philippine forecast
THE Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services (PAGASA) on Wednesday said 10 to 14 cyclones could enter the Philippine area of responsibility between May and October amid the El Niño threat.
Ana Lisa Solis, Climate Monitoring and Prediction Section chief, said El Niño characterized by below-normal rainfall could Lead to dry spells and drought in several areas.
The increase in the temperature of the seas could it favorable for tropical cyclones to develop, she noted.
During El Niño, more rains could be expected in western Luzon and other parts of the country, including Metro Manila, Cordilleras, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mimaropa and Bicol Region, she said.
“Based on our forecast , there will be 10 to 14 storms from May to October,” she said.

“We earlier said that before El Nino hits, there are above normal rainfall conditions. That is our forecast starting June, July: above-normal rainfall conditions,” she added.

28,DILG chief to name high-level ninja cops,byJoel E. ZurbanoandCharles Dantes,"May 4, 2023,","Interior and Local Government Secretary Benjamin Abalos Jr. said Wednesday he is set to reveal the names of resigned police generals and colonels who are suspected to be involved in the illegal drug trade.
ADVERTISEMENT
“Just wait. It’s now with the National Police Commission (Napolcom) and I, myself sit there as the chairman. With me is the new chief of PNP, Gen. (Benjamin) Acorda, and our vice chairman (Alberto) Bernardo and there are other commissioners. We are going to make a statement. Just give us about probably two days so we can cover all the legalities. When we make a statement, we want to make sure that everything is really airtight,” Abalos told reporters.
“I just want to assure the public there is really a house cleansing but we also want to make sure we really observe all the legalities here,” he added.
In January, Abalos called for the courtesy resignation of full colonels and generals as part of the government’s efforts to cleanse the ranks and get rid of “bad eggs” within the PNP.
The five-man panel tasked to evaluate the resigned police officials already completed its work.
Earlier reports said the team recommended filing cases against four ranking police officials.
There were also reports quoting former PNP chief Rodolfo Azurin Jr. that the four officials are two generals and two colonels.
The four were included in the 36 remaining officials that will undergo further review by Napolcom.
Abalos initiated the PNP “house cleansing” amid reports of the return of so-called “ninja cops” in the police force, who make money by reselling confiscated drugs.
The DILG chief said there is a need to take a radical approach versus illegal drugs by cleansing the PNP because it is unfair to the majority of the police officers who are putting their lives on the line everyday to combat illegal drugs while some of their bosses in the organization are behind the illegal drug trade.
“Many policemen risk their own lives to suppress illegal drugs, but their boss is their enemy. It is very unfair to the majority of our police force who work honestly,” he said.

The police officer was identified as Ney Saligumba Atadero, 50.
Atadero later told investigators that more illegal drugs were stored at a lending company office in Sta. Cruz, also in Manila.
The team came up with a follow up operation and discovered that another police officer assigned to the PNP Drug Enforcement Group’s Special Operations Unit in the National Capital Region was also involved.
Azurin confirmed in a message that the five-man panel had recommended the filing of charges against the two generals and two colonels
“We recommended it. And hopefully, chief PNP (Benjamin) Acorda will sustain our efforts on this,” said Azurin.
Azurin added that the next step would rest on how the Napolcom would act on the panel’s recommendations.
The advisory group also sent an earlier recommendation for Napolcom to conduct further investigation against 36 senior police officials over the possibility of their involvement in the narcotics trade.
Once that investigation is done, a recommendation will then be made to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.

29,Biden: US to defend PH,byVince Lopez,"May 3, 2023,","Washington D.C.—US President Joe Biden underlined America’s “ironclad” commitment to defending the Philippines as President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. referred to “difficult times” as the country finds itself in a region with “arguably the most complicated geopolitical situation in the world right now.”

“It is only natural for the Philippines to look to its sole treaty partner in the world to strengthen, to redefine, the relationship that we have and the roles that we play in the face of those rising tensions that we see now around the South China Sea and Asia Pacific,” Mr. Marcos said during his bilateral meeting with Biden at the White House Monday (Tuesday, Manila time).
Biden, for his part, said Washington remains “ironclad” in its commitment to the defense of the Philippines, including the South China Sea. “And we’re gonna continue [supporting] the Philippines’ military modernization,” he said.
“You know, when we met in New York last year, you told me that the strong alliance has to continue… I’m using your phrase, ‘to evolve as we face the challenges of this new century.’ And we are facing new challenges. And I can’t think of any better partner to have than you.”
“Our countries not only share strong partnership. We share a deep friendship, one that has been enriched by millions of Filipino-Americans and the communities all across the United States,” Biden added.
Mr. Marcos is on a five-day trip that follows last week’s state visit to Washington by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and a White House meeting in January between Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
A senior US official said Mr. Marcos’ visit – which began with a military honor guard outside the White House – was the first “at this level and intensity” between the two countries for decades.
“It is clear that we’re in a deeply consequential period in terms of our Indo-Pacific engagements,” the official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
In a fact sheet released by the White House, the US government said it will provide additional assets to the Philippine military in support of the latter’s modernization efforts.
Washington said it intends to transfer to the Armed Forces of the Philippines two Island-class patrol vessels, two Protector-class patrol vessels, and three C-130H aircraft, pending applicable Congressional notification requirements.
Further, two Cyclone-class coastal patrol vessels were already transferred to the Philippines in late April, and are now en route to Manila.

The tension, combined with constant saber rattling over Taiwan – the democratically run island that Beijing claims but Washington vows to help defend — has prompted the Biden administration to rapidly bolster its military capabilities.
The Philippines, which lies close to key sea lanes and Taiwan, is of particular interest.
In his opening remarks, Mr. Marcos noted with concern the escalating tensions in the Asia-Pacific and cited US assistance in maintaining peace and contribution to the stability and development of the region.
“We have many things that are new that need to be assessed and again our role as partners in the world,” he said, emphasizing the need for peace, not only in the region but also in the rest of the world.
This is the second in-person meeting between the two leaders. Their first meeting was on the sidelines of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2022.
Mr. Marcos signaled as he left for Washington that he is wary of being caught between the superpowers, telling reporters: “We will not allow the Philippines to be used as a staging post for any kind of military action.”
However, this month, the Philippines identified four military bases – in addition to five existing sites – where US forces will be given access, including one located near the tense Spratly Islands and two others near Taiwan.
The two allies also carried out their largest-ever military maneuvers in recent weeks.
That has alarmed China, which accuses Washington of trying to drive a wedge between Beijing and Manila—even though its own actions have driven the Philippines closer to its treaty ally.
On April 23, a Chinese vessel sailed into the path of a much smaller Philippine Coast Guard vessel carrying journalists in the Spratly Islands, causing a near-collision.
In an acknowledgment of Philippine sensitivities about the US troop presence, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby emphasized that the sites slated to be used by the United States remain part of the Filipino military and “every single step of the way will be done in complete coordination.”
“It’s about our ability to be better allies to one another and meet our commitments to each other,” he said.
In a joint statement, Mr. Marcos and Biden hailed the “remarkable ties of friendship, community, and shared sacrifice that serve as the foundation of the US-Philippines alliance.”
Both leaders said the identification of new sites under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) “will strengthen Philippine security and support the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ modernization goals, while driving US investment to local communities across the Philippines and improving our shared ability to rapidly deliver humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.”
Both leaders underscored their “unwavering commitment” to freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea, as well as the importance of respecting the sovereign rights of states within their exclusive economic zones consistent with international law.
“The leaders support the right and ability of Filipino fisherfolk to pursue their traditional livelihoods. The leaders note the ruling of the 2016 arbitral tribunal, constituted pursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),” the joint statement added.
The two leaders also affirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, which they described as an “indispensable element of global security and prosperity.”
Both Biden and Marcos conveyed their support for Ukraine in its sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, “noting that the conflict (with Russia) has adversely affected food and energy security in the Indo-Pacific.”
The United States Embassy in the Philippines reiterated on Tuesday its support for the 2016 arbitral ruling on the West Philippine Sea.
Speaking at the Stratbase ADR Institute discussion on Modernizing Philippine Defense Capabilities and Elevating Security Partnerships, US Embassy Political Counselor Brett Blackshaw said the US views the Ayungin Shoal as being under Philippine sovereignty and jurisdiction.
He said that China has no lawful territorial or maritime claim.
Blackshaw added that the United States values the Philippines as an equal sovereign partner and reaffirmed US support.
He also hailed President Marcos, noting that relations between the US and the Philippines have been invigorated under the present administration.
Blackshaw announced that the Philippines and the United States will be issuing the “first defense bilateral guidelines” between the two countries.
“One thing that would come out of this visit and is on track to be made public this Wednesday when President Marcos visits the Pentagon is the first ever Bilateral Defense Guidelines between the US and the Philippines,” Blackshaw said.
