4,Enforce ample measures vs El Niño: Abalos orders LGUs,Chito Chavez,"May 3, 2023 ","Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Benjamin “Benhur” Abalos Jr. ordered local chief executives (LCE) on Wednesday, May 3, to help mitigate the adverse effects of El Niño in their respective areas.
Abalos issued the order after the state weather bureau forecasted that the phenomenon may emerge in the next three months and will last until the first quarter of 2024.
“Included in the mitigation efforts are the urgent enactment of ordinances curbing illegal connections and encouraging prudent water usage; allowing water concessionaires and water utilities to conduct emergency leak repairs; lifting of application of number coding schemes with respect to water tankers used by water concessionaires to immediately address water supply needs of affected customers; implementing and updating of existing contingency plans related to El Niño; stockpiling of relief goods (food and non-food items) for immediate relief assistance, among others,’’ the DILG said.
In his Memorandum Circular (MC), Abalos noted that the LCEs are also tasked to conduct massive information, education, and communication campaigns in communities on checking and immediate fixing of water leaks, maximizing rainwater harvesting and storage; implementation of water conservation measures; setting the temperature of air-conditioning units between 22 degrees Celsius to 25 degrees Celsius.
He stressed that the preparatory steps can alleviate the ill effects of the phenomenon in terms of agriculture, water resources, marine resources, human health, and environment, as a whole.
“Conserving water is one of the key actions needed to be taken to mitigate effects of El Niño and as public servants, we must set an example. These precautionary steps, albeit small, can make a big difference that can affect our communities,” he added.
The memorandum circular also listed down water conservation tips like turning off faucets while brushing teeth, using a glass instead; removing all leftover foods before washing the dishes; washing them using a small basin; storing and reusing the final rinse water to flush toilets; storing and reusing laundry water to clean floors, flush toilets, etc; watering plants early in the morning or late in the afternoon to minimize evaporation; not hosing down vehicles, clean it using a washcloth and pail; using water-efficient gadgets, such as high-pressure, low-volume hoses and showerheads, faucets with aerators and double-flush toilets among others.
“The LCEs are also urged to coordinate with Department of Agriculture regional offices for conduct of cloud seeding operations, implementation of rotational irrigation scheme and water-saving technology; strategizing of areas to be irrigated and reusing wastewater from drainage canals; utilizing solar pump irrigation; adapting drought-resistant and early-maturing seed varieties; and adjusting cropping calendar, among others,’’ the DILG added.

To avoid public confusion, Abalos clarified that the Philippine National Police (PNP) officers whose resignations were accepted were among the more than 950 police generals and colonels who were asked to resign as part of the PNP’s cleansing process.
Recently, the PNP came under fire in view of the alleged high-profile illegal drug involvement worth billions of pesos of some police officers.
“So eto (courtesy resignations) ngayon ang tatalakayin, ilan dito (police officers) ang tinanggap ang resignation, ilan ang hindi tinanggap ang resignation at ano ang mangyayari (there were some whose resignations were accepted, a number of the resignations were rejected and this is what will transpire). We will make that statement in two days, okay,” Abalos said.
Abalos assured the public that the names of the PNP generals and colonels who will be removed from the police roster will be made public but additional time would be needed to ensure that all legalities are covered for them to come up with ‘airtight’ statements.
In his meeting with the NAPOLCOM, Abalos stated “ actually, kahapon (May 2) nag-usap na kami rito (Yesterday we already had a discussion). I just want to reassure the public that we will make sure that there will really be a house cleansing but we also want to make sure na talagang lahat ng legalities ay observe natin rito (that all legalities are observed).’’

This was among the investments bagged by President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. while in Washington for a five-day working visit.
In a meeting with Marcos, the Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI) announced its investment in a new R&D facility to add to its LEED certified production facility at the Gateway Business Park in Cavite.
According to ADI, it would continue to decide on the manufacturing aspects and change the manufacturing operation to focus more on current technology.
They said rather than the more basic stuff that may have been done 15 to 20 years ago, they have continued to increase the level of technology that’s been introduced since the planning.
“So today you hear about 300 mm wafers, 12-inch wafers, in there. Well, those wafers now come down and we are setting up a 300-mm Center of Excellence in Cavite, which is doing all of the wafer programs and associated with our products,"" an ADI official told the President.
These are some of the most advanced technology products that come in, get tested and processed at ADI’s Cavite plant, ADI said, adding the company has moved at all stages to the technology part, both from development and manufacturing perspectives.
Marcos welcomed the company's expansion plans and affirmed the support of his administration to its endeavors.
Established in 1965, ADI is a global semiconductor leader using Intelligent Edge. It combines analog, digital, and software technologies into solutions that help drive advancements in digitized factories, mobility and digital healthcare, combat climate change, and reliably connect humans and the world.

9,Advocacy group highlights importance of integrating civic education in all subjects,Merlina Hernando-Malipot,"May 3, 2023 ","To promote the development of critical thinking skills, civic engagement, and social responsibility among Filipino learners, an advocacy group pushes for the integration of civic education in all subjects.
The Philippine Business for Education (PBEd), through its online learning platform Sibika.ph, pushed for civic education in all subjects.
“By incorporating civic education into different learning settings and teaching methods, we support the advocacy for a more holistic approach to education which not only prepares students for employment but also develops their character and sense of civic responsibility,” said PBEd Deputy Executive Director for Programs Bal Camua said during the Youth Leadership for Democracy (YouthLed PH) Civic Education Summit 2023.
The platform Sibika.ph provides teachers with free and accessible resources for teaching civic education, helping them equip students with a better understanding of their role in society.
The resources include Department of Education (DepEd)-certified (Understanding Culture, Society and Politics) modules, educational videos, and curated materials on civic education.
The summit, organized by YouthLed, a project of The Asia Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development, took place at Diamond Hotel last month.
It featured discussions on developing civic knowledge and skills among teachers and the youth, with a showcase of online and offline training opportunities and resources.
Special sessions were conducted among teachers and education supervisors nationwide on pedagogical innovations for delivering civic education to learners.
The event also provided a platform for the academe, government, civil society, private sector, and student and youth-led organizations to discuss the state of civic education in the Philippines.
Civic education is vital for nation-building
During the panel discussion, teachers emphasized the importance of civic education in teaching students about their rights and responsibilities.
With the use of various methods such as small group discussions, immersion programs, and metaphors, they were able to instill collaboration, social responsibility, and integrity in their students while addressing community problems.
“What we can learn from this is that civic education is an essential part of every student's education, and we recognize that it can be integrated into all subjects and at all grade levels,” Camua said.
Camua added that the ongoing review of the K to 12 curriculum and convening of the Second Congressional Commission on Education are “opportune time to include the critical role of civic education in the formation of the youth to become responsible citizens and contribute to nation-building,” he added.

10,"Ombudsman orders 6-month preventive suspension of MIAA acting GM Chiong, acting GM for finance Montalbo",Rey G. Panaligan,"May 3, 2023 ","Ombudsman Samuel R. Martires has ordered the prevention suspension for not more than six months without pay of Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) Acting General Manager Cesar M. Chiong and Acting General Manager for Finance and Administration Irene P. Montalbo.
In an order issued last April 28, Martires said his office acted on the administrative complaint for grave abuse of authority, grave misconduct, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service filed by 285 MIAA employees who claimed they were indiscriminately reassigned.
Ching was appointed acting MIAA general manager on July 19, 2022 and barely a month after assuming office, he started the reassignment of airport employees.
The OMB said that “sworn statements from the reassigned employees would reveal that they were neither informed of the reason for their reassignment nor did they have pending administrative complaints.”
It said “Chiong abused his authority/position when he designated Montalbo as assistant general manager for finance and administration notwithstanding her unsatisfactory rating and when he indiscriminately reassigned about 285 MIAA employees.”
It also said “Montalbo cannot deny her participation in the reassignment of MIAA employees because, as the designated assistant general manager for finance and administration, it is her function to advise the general manager in the formulation and implementation of administrative matters.”
“Based on the evidence on record, it appears that the evidence of guilt of the respondents (Chiong and Montalbo) are strong and the charge against them involves Grave Misconduct which may warrant their removal from the service,” it said.
“Considering further that respondents’ continued stay in the office may influence potential witnesses and may prejudice the case filed against them due to their continued access to documentary evidence relative thereto, this Office exercises its power to place respondents under preventive suspension,” it also said.
“Wherefore, pursuant to Section 24 of Republic Act No. 6770, Cesar M. Chiong and Irene P. Montalbo are hereby placed under preventive suspension without pay for the duration of the proceedings until the same is terminated, but not to exceed six (6) months,” it ruled.
In a published statement, Chiong admitted the reassignment of the employees in his “effort to improve airport operations.”
He expressed confidence that he would be vindicated and cleared of the complaint filed before the OMB.
Also, he pointed out that MIAA’s finances had improved even without government subsidy since he took over, adding that “putting MIAA in good financial stead is one of my visions.”
Montalbo could not be contacted as of posting.
On Labor Day last May 1, an eight-hour power outage hit one of the terminals of MIAA.  The power outage stranded thousands of passengers and delayed several domestic and international flights.

13,PMFTC reduces carbon footprint with EV shift,Manila Bulletin,"May 3, 2023 ","In a bid towards achieving its smoke-free future vision, the country’s leading tobacco company, PMFTC Inc., has moved to reduce its carbon footprint by beginning to deploy 10 fully electric vehicles (EVs) for its service fleet.
The shift means PMFTC is now the first company in the Philippines to deploy fully electric vehicles for its salesmen, servicing the company’s Pasig, Marikina and Rizal areas of operations.
“Our journey of transformation is naturally linked to our Sustainable Fleet initiative. Just as our ambition is to replace cigarettes with better alternatives as quickly as possible, we have a responsibility to have a net positive impact on society by reducing the environmental impact of our products, operations, and value chain. This is our commitment to become a major part of the Philippines’ shift towards electro-mobility,” said PMFTC President Denis Gorkun.
PMFTC now becomes the first among mother company Philip Morris International’s (PMI) affiliates to move towards EVs, in line with PMI’s low-carbon transition plan which commits to achieving carbon neutrality by 2025 and net-zero emissions of its value-chain by 2040.
PMFTC’s EV fleet will consist of 10 BYD T3 Mini Vans, which are 100% electric logistics vehicles with a range of 250km, with each vehicle having a carrying capacity of up to 700 kilos in load. The vehicles will be supported by BYD’s NCR-based service center.
In minimizing its fleet’s dependence on fossil fuels, the EVs are expected to reduce carbon emissions by 84,954 kg. per year.
“Reducing consumption to cut greenhouse gas emissions, minimizing fossil fuel use and prioritizing nature-based solutions is us doing our part to make sure our employees, customers, and stakeholders to improve sustainability,” Gorkun added.
PMFTC targets to deploy another 10 EV units before the year ends.
In addition, the company plans to enhance its telematics technologies to promote eco-driving behaviors and improve safety, efficiency and productivity among its fleet drivers.

14,‘Above-normal’ rainfall conditions possible over western Luzon despite El Niño,Ellalyn De Vera-Ruiz,"May 3, 2023 ","Despite the increasing likelihood of El Niño development, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) warned that Western Luzon may experience “above-normal” rainfall during the southwest monsoon or “habagat” season.
El Niño is characterized by “unusually” warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific that could cause negative effects, such as drought and dry spell, in some areas of the country.
However, PAGASA-Climate Monitoring and Prediction Section Chief Ana Liza Solis noted that another effect of El Niño is the occurrence of above-normal rainfall, particularly affecting the western parts of Luzon.
“Historically, we see that Luzon, particularly the western part, receives more rain during the southwest monsoon season than any other areas,” Solis said in Filipino during a public briefing on Wednesday, May 3.
Metro Manila and the western portions of Luzon and the Visayas fall under the Type 1 climate category. These areas experience two distinct seasons: dry from November to April and rainy the rest of the year.
According to Solis, the months of June and July will see above-average rainfall in the Cordillera Administrative Region, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Metro Manila, Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon), Mimaropa (Oriental Mindoro, Occidental Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon, Palawan), and Bicol Region.
“With the looming El Niño, we see that there is a reversal of rainfall pattern, where there are more rains during the monsoon in the aforementioned areas,” Solis said.
By August, September, and October, it will gradually become dry in other areas, such as Central and Eastern Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, Caraga, Dinagat Islands, and Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, she pointed out.
10-14 cyclones from May to October
Solis said that before and during El Niño, there is an unusual warming of the tropical Pacific, which is favorable for tropical cyclone formation.
Based on PAGASA’s latest forecast, 10 to 14 tropical cyclones may enter or form within the country’s area of responsibility from May to October: one or 2 in May, one or two in June, two to four in July, two or three in August, two or three in September, and two or three in October.
During these months, Solis said there will be cyclones that may “recurve,” or may not directly affect the Philippines, while others may make “landfall” or cross the country.
She emphasized that the first few months of the southwest monsoon season, from May to July, are typically when recurving cyclones occur.
However, Solis said a recurving cyclone could strengthen the effects of the habagat by pulling the moisture causing rains.
On May 2, PAGASA raised the El Niño Southern Oscillation Alert and Warning System to “alert” as the probability of El Niño developing in the June-July-August period increased to 80 percent.

The event was also attended by DSWD Secretary Rex Gatchalian, DSWD Undersecretary Monina Jose Romualdez, Assistant Secretary Uly Aguilar, and Vistareit Inc. General Manager Dino Francisco.
""Alam namin na paghihingi kayo ng tulong sa DSWD, lumuluwas pa kayo papunta sa Central Office sa Batasan, magastos, malayo kaya naisip namin ni Mayor Art na ang pinakamadali ay maglagay na tayo dito sa San Jose (We know that you had to commute to Central Office in Batasan when you need to request for assistance.  It is far and costly, that is why, Mayor Art and I thought that putting up a satellite office in San Jose is the best remedy),"" the DSWD chief stated.
He also thanked Robes for the city's assistance in providing supplies for the new AICS office as well as Starmall Management for giving free space in the mall.
First clients
One of the first clients of the new AICS center was cancer patient Geraldine Valmoria.
""Kaming mga patient na may cancer, hirap na hirap kasi nagugutuman kami, nagche-chemo pa kami. Ngayong may malapit na office hindi na kami mahirapan. (For cancer patients like us, it is very difficult because we get hungry as we are undergoing chemotherapy. With the satellite office, it is now more convenient for us),"" she said, recalling her struggles traveling from her home in SJDM to Quezon City.
Meanwhile, 45-year-old Rolando Corbe from Barangay Sapang Palay said that the new office will make his access to medical assistance easier.

17,"DepEd seeks help of partners for key reform objectives, priority interventions in education",Merlina Hernando-Malipot,"May 3, 2023 ","The Department of Education (DepEd), under the leadership of Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte, sought the assistance of its partners to implement priority interventions and key reform objectives for the country’s basic education sector.

In a statement issued Wednesday, May 3, DepEd said that its key officials presented the agency’s priority interventions to the Official Development Assistance (ODA) and local partners in a convergence meeting at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Headquarters.
“The Department of Education gives a special place to our partners,” said Education Undersecretary for Finance Annalyn Sevilla.
“We have to realize that the DepEd's goal to provide quality and accessible basic education to all Filipino learners requires collaboration and a helping hand from organizations and stakeholders like you,” she added.
Sevilla also presented its key reform objectives that focus on several programs geared towards the digitalization of finance processes.
The Finance Strand, which Sevilla heads, also aims to prioritize scholarships including capacity building on loan management, and financial literacy programs for DepEd personnel.
The School Infrastructure and Facilities strand, led by Undersecretary Epimaco Densing III, requests assistance from the partners in addressing classroom shortages through construction or rehabilitation, building disaster-resilient schools, retrofitting classrooms, and electrification programs.
He also shared with the partners that “more than a million of learners are still conducting classes under a makeshift/temporary classrooms or some are under the trees.”
DepEd Undersecretary for Administration Kristian Ablan also discussed possible collaborations with partners on DepEd initiatives in the digitization of forms, enhancement of existing systems, and assistance for its parametric and indemnity insurance for public schools.
Curriculum and Teaching (CT) Strand Undersecretary Gina Gonong said that they will focus priority interventions on strengthening its literacy and numeracy programs, review the Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE), digitizing national assessments, strengthening of inclusive education program, and inclusive teaching approaches, among others.
The CT is considered one of the main pillars of the MATATAG Agenda.

Meanwhile, Undersecretary for Human Resource and Organizational Development (HROD) Gloria Jumamil-Mercado presented the development of quality assurance effectiveness, upscaling of the National Educators' Academy of the Philippines, and knowledge sharing from the partners in their expertise as their priority programs for interventions.
DepEd Assistant Secretary for Operations Dexter Galban also presented the mobile medical and dental clinics project of the strand as a program consideration for the partners.
He also discussed the school-based feeding program, learner rights and protection mechanisms, mental health program, learner and youth program development, and the farm-to-table nutrition project of DepEd as the main programs of the Agency promoting learner welfare, as stated in the MATATAG Agenda.
DepEd Assistant Secretary Omar Alexander Romero, on the other hand, discussed the plans of the Procurement strand to improve the procurement processes of the Department through continuous capacity building and digitalization.
This convergence meeting wrapped up the preliminary activities of DepEd for the Partners’ Forum on May 25.
The first meeting held in Baguio City involved DepEd Central Office and Regional Officers for the development of the menu of interventions.

The Czech Embassy in Manila said Prague is expressing its gratitude for all the ""brave journalists and media professionals"" around the world.
It said freedom of speech and independent media are vital for good governance, informed decision-making and accountability of governments.
""The ongoing war in Europe clearly demonstrates the importance of freedom of the press as a source of independent and truthful information, which lead to an adequate reaction of the democratic governments,"" it said.
France, on the other hand, said it remains ""committed to promoting press freedom, protecting journalists and combating impunity for crimes against journalists;"" while Canada thanked the mediamen ""for their relentless pursuit of the truth and their commitment to share those truths with us.""

20,'PH has a lot to offer'--Romualdez,Ellson Quismorio,"May 3, 2023 ","""The Philippines has a lot to offer.""
House Speaker Martin Romualdez proudly made this statement Wednesday, May 3 following an announcement that some 75,000 Filipino seafarers were going to be hired by a United States (US) firm in the next three to four years.
“The Philippines has a lot to offer foreign investors, including a young and growing workforce, a strategic location, and a favorable business environment,"" said Romualdez, who is accompanying President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. in his ongoing US visit.
""I am confident that Pres. Marcos, Jr. will continue to attract more foreign investment to our country, which will help us achieve our goal of inclusive growth,” added the Leyte 1st district congressman.
In one of Marcos' many meetings in the US since arriving there over the weekend, the president and CEO of Carnival Corp. told him that his group of companies was set to hire some 75,000 Filipino seafarers in the next three to four years.
John Padgett, who also represents Carnival Cruise Line, Holland American Airlines and Seaborn, praised Filipino workers for their hospitality and competitiveness in the global workforce.
Marcos also met with officials of business process outsourcing (BPO) firm Atento, which has decided to set up its first call center in the Philippines at the Iloilo Business Park in Mandurriao district of Iloilo City.
The President thanked Atento President Fili Ledezma Soto and Chief Delivery Officer Josh Ashby and assured them that they made the right decision as “Filipinos speak and write the best English"".
Romualdez, for his part, said: “It is heartening to note that the President’s mission to the US has scored significant gains that would not only spur further economic growth but more importantly, result in direct benefits for thousands of Filipino workers in terms of job created.""

21,"CHR to gov’t agencies: Emulate DepEd’s stand on red-tagging, trolling, extrajudicial killings",Jeffrey Damicog,"May 3, 2023 ","The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) on Wednesday, May 3, urged government agencies to emulate the Department of Education (DepEd) in upholding human rights in its draft curriculum for Araling Panlipunan that cited “red-tagging, trolling and extrajudicial killings (EJKs) as human rights violations.”
In a statement, the CHR said it has been denouncing red-tagging and EJKs.  It said that red-tagging “only serves to stigmatize and silence individuals and groups critical of the government or advocating for social justice.”
“More alarmingly, however, is that this red-tagging practice has resulted in numerous human rights violations, including enforced disappearances, torture, and even arbitrary executions,” it said.
“CHR hopes that this commitment from the DepEd is replicated by other stakeholders and government agencies to protect and promote human rights in all aspects of Philippine society,” the CHR said in a statement.
It then urged DepED “to ensure that the implementation of the curriculum is consistent with the principles of human rights education, and that it provides accurate and balanced information on the issue.”
At the same time, it called on other branches of government “to take concrete steps to address the root causes of red-tagging and ensure that those responsible for human rights violations are held accountable.”
It noted that the “DepEd's decision to incorporate the recognition of red-tagging, trolling, and extrajudicial killings as human rights violations into its curriculum is a significant step towards promoting a culture of respect for human rights and the rule of law among young Filipinos.”
“The Commission believes that this proposition will not only help raise awareness among students on the dangers of red-tagging, but also on the importance of protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of all individuals,” it said.
Also, the CHR said “DepEd's recent draft curriculum is consistent with their existing policy on Rights-Based Education (RBE) Framework for Philippine basic education.”
It said the RBE Framework emphasizes “the need to integrate human rights concepts, values, and principles across all subjects and levels of education.”
“This inclusion of red-tagging, trolling, and EJKs as human rights violations shows a concrete example of the application of the RBE Framework in addressing human rights issues, and provides an opportunity for students to critically analyze the complex and multi-faceted nature of human rights violations, and to explore ways to address them through peaceful and lawful means,” it added.

22,PCG: 400 liters of oily water mixtures collected as leak continues in Oriental Mindoro,Martin Sadongdong,"May 3, 2023 ","More than two months since motor tanker (MT) Princess Empress sank and triggered a massive oil spill in Oriental Mindoro, loads of spilt oil are still being collected by response teams as leak continues from the sunken vessel.
(Photo courtesy of PCG)
The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) reported that approximately 400 liters of oily water mixtures were collected during another round of clean up operations off Balingawan Point on Tuesday, May 2, exactly 63 days since MT Princess Empress sank off Naujan town on Feb. 28.
The PCG said that the clean up was spearheaded by Malayan Towage and Salvage Corp., the contractor hired by the owner and operator of MT Princess Empress, RDC Reield Marine Services, Inc. 
The Malayan Towage and Salvage Corp. deployed oil spill boom and skimmer from its two motor tugboats, M/Tug Titan 1 and M/Tug Cabilao, so their personnel could manually scoop the spilt oil in the waters off Balingawan Point as new oil sheens were sighted in the area, the PCG said.
“The offshore response team recovered approximately 400 liters of oily water mixtures,” the PCG said on Wednesday, May 3. 
Rear Adm. Armando Balilo, PCG spokesperson, has said that efforts to float the sunken MT Princess Empress and have it removed underwater “is out of the question” for now as they are focused on collecting the spilt oil.
“Sa ngayon, out of the question ‘yung pagpapalutang po noon at ang nais lang natin ay makuha ‘yong oil para matapos na itong problema natin dito (For now, floating it is out of the question and what we only want to do is to collect the oil so we can finally solve this problem),” Balilo said in a radio interview with dzBB on Tuesday.
The PCG has since collected 5,963 sacks (approximately 149,075 kilos) and 22 drums (approximately 2,750 kilos) of oil contaminated debris in nine affected barangays in Naujan, Calapan, and Pola towns in Oriental Mindoro from March 1 to May 2.
Sustaining the clean up
Meanwhile, absorbent pads made from coconut oil are now being considered to be used to sustain the dragging oil spill clean up operations in Oriental Mindoro.
The Marine Science Technician (MST) from the United States Coast Guard conducted a field testing of absorbent pads made from coconut oil on May 1 to test whether they can be used in cleaning up the oil spill. The absorbent pads were endorsed by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST).
The MST also tested fiber absorbent pads from local company EcoTrends which were installed in Brgy. Navotas, Calapan, Oriental Mindoro to pick up the oil and prevent it from further spreading in other areas of the province.

23,Zubiri: No need for EDCAs if there are no bullies,Mario Casayuran,"May 3, 2023 ","Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri on Wednesday, May 3, said the Philippines does not need PH-US Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) sites if there are no bullies in the South China Sea.
Zubiri made this observation during a press forum  following a statement of US President Joe Biden in Washington that he “can’t think of any better partner to have than” President Marcos  as they held a bilateral meeting on Monday headlined by regional security issues spawned by China’s aggressive activities in the South China Sea.
The South China Sea, a busy sea lane where more than $5 trillion in goods pass through every year, is the subject of a longstanding maritime row involving China, which claims virtually the entire area, and the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan, which have overlapping claims.
Zubiri said China, an economic and military power, has been harassing Philippine Navy and Coast Guard  vessels in the West Philippine Sea although the United Nations Arbitration Court rejected China’s historical claim over most parts of the South China Sea in 2016.
Earlier, Senator. Jospeh Victor ‘’JV’’ Ejercito lamented that while China claims it is friend of the Philippines, ‘’it acts otherwise.’’ China is a bully, he added.
Zubiri said that relatively big Chinese Coast Guard vessels have been bullying Philippine vessels and harassing fishermen in the Scarborough Shoal, Ayungin Shoal and Pagasa island .\ \
These are nearer to Philippine territory than to China and are well within the Philippine exclusive economic zone (EEZ), he explained.
The Scarborough Shoal is about 200 nautical miles west of Zambales in Luzon or is more than 800 nautical miles east of Hainan, the easternmost land mass of China.
China claims possession of the seas after 80 kilometers off these shoals and islands in the Philippines, Zubiri said.
Zubiri said the US, under Philippine-US military agreements,’’ could also act with dispatch on how to help defend us, in times where there will be intrusions from other countries because they are a treaty ally. We are a treaty ally with the United States.’’
While President Marcos had said that the Philippines does not have enemies but it is a friend to all, Zubiri pointed out that there are bullies around that harass Filipino fishermen, Philippine Navy and Coast Guard vessels.
""At dahil doon, sa aking panaanaw, talagang kailangan natin ang EDCA sites (That to me is basis to support the EDCA sites). Kailangan natin ng tulong galing sa ating kapatid at treaty ally na Amerikano (We need the help of a brother and a treaty ally),’’ he stressed.
""Let’s face it, kulang na kulang po tayo ng armas, wala po tayo masyadong surface-to-air missiles, wala po tayong mga torpedo, wala po tayong mga anti-tank missiles, maliliit po ang ating barko (Let’s face it, we really need arms, we don’t have surface-to-air missiles, we don’t have torpedos, we don’t have anti-tank missiles, our vessels are small),"" he said.
""Now, under the EDCA sites, we allow our partner and ally, our treaty ally, the United States, to do temporary basing ng mga (of their) equipment nila,’’ he added.
The Senate chief said that under EDCA, the US also helps the country in times of calamities or natural disasters.
He cited US help in the Mindoro oil spill and in the search for persons missing following a sinking of a dive boat in Tubbataha, Palawan.

24,"DepEd beefs up training programs for teachers, school leaders",Merlina Hernando-Malipot,"May 3, 2023 ","To discuss the provision of high-quality professional development programs and courses to teachers and school leaders, the Department of Education (DepEd) converged with the National Network of Normal Schools.
DepEd, through the National Educators Academy of the Philippines (NEAP) and Teacher Education Council Secretariat (TECS), convened with the National Network of Normal Schools (3Ns) to ensure the provision of quality training programs for teachers and school leaders in schools nationwide.
“I have so much respect for State Universities being a product of public school,” said Undersecretary for Human Resource and Organizational Development Gloria Jumamil-Mercado.
The gathering was participated by the member universities of the 3Ns such as the Philippine Normal University, Bicol University, Bukidnon State University, Cebu Normal University, Leyte Normal University, Mariano Marcos State University, Palawan State University, Pangasinan State University, West Mindanao State University, West Visayas State University, with the participation of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines.
“When I came to DepEd, I said that we’ll make it a policy that starting 2023 we will be working very closely with the Normal Schools, especially with the passage of RA 11713,” she added.
DepEd noted that the convergence was also in line with the “Give support to teachers to teach better” of the agency’s MATATAG Agenda.
The collaboration was also aligned with the passage of RA 11713, also known as the Excellence in Teacher Education Act, which strengthens ties between and among the concerned government agencies and unifies the interests of various stakeholders in teacher education in the Philippines.
“We will be ensuring that most of our partners on the ground would be part of the complementation and convergence between DepEd and Normal Schools and other schools that are considered Center of Excellence (COE) and Center of Development (COD) in Teacher Education. We will continue working together,” Jumamil-Mercado explained.
The convergence also aimed to co-develop the Professional Development Curriculum for teachers and school leaders, provide updates concerning in-service teachers, and orient the 3Ns on Education Futures.

“The two groups would be composed of 80 and 72 OFWs, respectively. They belong to the 340 OFWs that were assisted by the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Philippine Embassy in Cairo (PE-Cairo) in crossing over from the Sudan Port into the Argeen Land Port Authority in Aswan, Egypt,” said Ople.
“We are also negotiating with Philippine Airlines for a chartered flight to bring the remaining 188 OFWs from the group of 340 rescued plus an anticipated 104 OFWs that would be arriving this week after successfully clearing the Egyptian border,” she added.
In negotiating with PAL, Ople said they want to take advantage of its partnership with EGYPTAIR that would enable it to come up with flight arrangements from Cairo to Dubai and onward to Manila. 
Last month, top DMW officials led by Ople flew to Cairo to personally supervise the repatriation of 340 OFWs who earlier asked the Philippine government to rescue them amid the ongoing conflict between soldiers and paramilitary troopers in Sudan. 
Over 700 OFWs and Filipinos have already contacted the nearest Philippine embassy and around half of them earlier asked the Philippine government for repatriation.
Ople also vowed to provide financial and livelihood assistance to the Filipinos who decided to be repatriated. 
On the other hand, she said she has been coordinating with his counterpart in Saudi Arabia for the temporary employment of some of the affected OFWs that would be repatriated from Sudan. 
“Our DMW and OWWA (Overseas Workers Welfare Administration) teams continue to look after our distressed OFWs as part of our commitment to bring them home in close coordination, of course, with the DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs)” Ople said. 
“OWWA and the DMW are committed to bring as many of our kababayans home, so that the process of healing from the trauma of Sudan’s civil war can commence,” she added.

26,VP Duterte thanks envoy for deepening PH-Singapore ties,Raymund Antonio,"May 3, 2023 ","Vice President Sara Duterte thanked outgoing Singaporean Ambassador to the Philippines Gerard Ho Wei Hong for his contribution in deepening ties between Singapore and the Philippines.
Duterte expressed her appreciation to Hong as the envoy paid a farewell call on the Vice President at her office in Mandaluyong City.
Ambassador Hong ended this month his four-year tour of duty in the Philippines as Singapore’s top diplomat.
The official said Hong was appointed as permanent representatives of his country to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
“Sa isang (In a) farewall call, nagpasalamat tayo sa lahat ng tulong ng Singapore sa Pilipinas (we thanked him for the help of Singapore to the Philippines),” Duterte said in Facebook post.
The Vice President’s father, then President Rodrigo Duterte, received Hong’s credentials at the Malacañang Palace in March 2019.
That year, the countries commemorated the 50th year of the establishment of their diplomatic relations.

27,"Kadiwa stores to sell 4M kilos of sugar seized in anti-smuggling ops, SRA says",Aaron Recuenco,"May 3, 2023 ","At least 4,000 metric tons of sugar that were seized in various anti-smuggling operations of the government will be distributed to all Kadiwa stores nationwide and will be sold at a cheaper price, the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) disclosed on Wednesday, May 3.
SRA acting administrator Pablo Azcona said the figure translates to four million kilos of sugar that will be sold to the government’s Kadiwa stores immediately after the final approval of their release to the market.
“We still have 6,000 (metric tons) that were confiscated and hopefully they will be released once they are proven safe and approved for donation to kadiwa,” said Azcona during the Laging Handa Public Briefing.
The 4,000 metric tons of smuggled sugar that are expected to be sold to the kadiwa stores in the coming days were already declared safe for consumption.
The Kadiwa store is the government’s program aimed at directly sending agricultural products from the market to ensure reduced prices as it removed additional costs charged by middlemen.
Aside from the kadiwa stores, Azcona said they are also eyeing the sale of smuggled sugar to groceries and supermarkets, which he said, assured that they will be sold at Kadiwa prices.
“There are groceries and supermarkets which volunteered to put up shelves for Kadiwa,” said Azcona, adding that the sugar will also be sold at P70 per kilo.
He, however, said that their experts are now studying if there are legal implications of the recommendation to sell smuggled sugar to supermarkets.
Meanwhile, Azcona said around 180,000 metric tons of refined sugar that were imported by the national government have already arrived and around 116,000 metric tons of them were already distributed to the market. 
The rest of the 440,000 metric tons, according to Azcona, are expected to arrive in August this year.

28,5-man panel recommends filing of charges vs 4 PNP officials over drug links,Aaron Recuenco,"May 3, 2023 ","Four senior police officials, whose courtesy resignations were recommended to be accepted by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr., were formerly assigned to the top anti-narcotics unit of the Philippine National Police (PNP).
Aside from the acceptance of the courtesy resignation, the five-man Advisory Group headed by former PNP chief Rofolfo Azurin, Jr. also recommended the filing of charges against the four police officials composed of two one-star generals and two full colonels.
Azurin confirmed to the Manila Bulletin that the four senior police officials are former officers of the PNP-Drug Enforcement Group-- the police's unit tasked to run after drug syndicates and stop illegal drugs proliferation in the country
He added that at least one of them was subjected to investigation over the return of Police Master Sgt. Rodolfo Mayo, Jr. to the PDEG.
Mayo was among the hundreds of cops sent to Mindanao during the time of former PNP chief and now Senator Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa as punishment for involvement in illegal drugs. They were referred to before as ninja cops, or those who recycle confiscated illegal drugs.
Dela Rosa himself was surprised as to why the former was able to return to the PDEG and was even tasked as intelligence officer for Metro Manila.
Mayo, whose dismissal from the service was approved by Azurin, was tagged in the 990 kilos of shabu seized in a raid in Manila in October last year.
The involvement of Mayo in the one of the biggest drug haul of the PNP led to the request of Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos for all the nearly 1,000 PNP third level officers to submit a courtesy resignation as part of internal cleansing.
Based on the latest data, a total of 917 PNP senior officers were already cleared by the five-man Advisory Group while 36 others were recommended to be further evaluated by the National Police Commission (Napolcom).
Aside from Azurin, retired PNP general and now Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong and former Defense secretary Gilbert Teodoro composed the five-man Advisory Group.
Both Azurin and Magalong, in separate interviews, said the conduct of the evaluation of all PNP senior officers would bring integrity and credibility for the PNP in the renewed campaign against illegal drugs.
The recommendations of the five-man Advisory Group are still subject for review of Napolcom before they are forwarded to Marcos for approval.
Prior to his retirement late last month, Azurin said the genuine internal cleansing in the PNP is his major contribution to the police organization and to the country.

Legarda said Republic Act No. 11293, or the Philippine Innovation Act, which she principally authored and co-sponsored, already sets the starting point in recognizing innovation's role in governance.
 
The law, she said, already provides the necessary resources to support innovations “that will improve our daily lives.”
 
The senator pointed out innovation is more than just scientific inventions and should also be applied in all aspects of governance. 
 
""Innovation is not intended only for inventors and those who pursued invention as a calling. This Act should spell a sea of change in how we do governance,"" Legarda said in her speech at the 2023 National Innovation Day with the theme “HABI: Huddle, Analyze, Build, Innovate” last April 28.
 
The lawmaker stressed that under the law, the State should make innovation a primary consideration in developing policies to support inventors and innovate in governance itself. 
 
Legarda said strict implementation of this law is essential to achieve a truly functioning and thriving national innovation system.
 
""Through the Philippine Innovation Act, we hope to elicit invention in all layers of government, bring together the brightest and most innovative minds, and think elastically and out of the box; and in order to do so, we hope to provide an innovation ecosystem that facilitates and supports these risk-taking behaviors,"" said Legarda.
 
The law established the National Innovation Council (NIC), which is tasked to act in all levels and areas of education, training, research, and development towards promoting innovation and internationalization activities of MSMEs nationwide.
 
The law also includes a provision for the Innovation Fund to provide financial support for research and development initiatives, technology transfer, and other innovation-related activities.

The US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) recently signed a P111 million (USD 2 million) grant partnership agreement that will boost the Philippines' capacities in adapting, mitigating and managing the impacts of climate change and natural disasters.
Under the agreement, KOICA will support the USAID's implementation of five-year Climate Resilient Cities Project that will benefit the cities of Batangas, Borongan, Cotabato, Iloilo, Legazpi and Zamboanga.
KOICA's technical assistance will enhance the capacity of local government units (LGUs) to develop guidelines for and use climate adaptation technology, according to the US Embassy in Manila.
Both agencies will also support the six LGUs and other stakeholders ""to more effectively disseminate climate-related information to local communities; increase access to climate financing for economic and social development; and promote natural climate solutions that strengthen cities' resilience to climate change,"" the embassy said on Wednesday.
Soon, the governments of both countries will also launch a deal to prevent and reduce marine pollution in Manila Bay.
""This partnership also seeks to enhance knowledge and influence social and behavioral changes for marine pollution reduction and prevention,"" the embassy said.
The latest agreement between the two agencies followed the April 2021 signing of a Memorandum of Understanding, where they agreed to collaborate on priority programs, including climate change-related initiatives, in the Philippines.
The Philippines are among the countries facing the risk of climate change. It is also considered vulnerable.
With about 20 typhoons yearly and frequent floods, landslides, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, the Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone nations.

37,"House to thank OFWs by giving Pinoys a brighter future, says Romualdez",Ellson Quismorio,"May 3, 2023 ","As its way of thanking overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) for their contributions to the Philippines, Speaker Martin Romualdez vowed that the House of Representatives would continue to work closely with the Marcos administration toward its ""vision for a brighter future for all Filipinos"".
Romualdez had this to say as he joined President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. and the rest of his delegation during a meeting with the Filipino-American community at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Washington DC, following the bilateral meeting with United States (US) President Joe Biden.
“The House of Representatives will continue working hand-in-hand with President Marcos
to advance his legislative, policies, and initiatives geared towards job creation, improved business climate, and a better life for all Filipinos,” Romualdez said.
“This is our way of thanking all our [OFWs] or their invaluable contributions to the economic growth of our country and for showcasing to the world the solid work ethic, talent, and the good nature of all Filipinos,” added the Leyte 1st district congressman, who is arguably Marcos' most trusted ally in Philippine government.
OFWs are often cited by local authorities for their sacrifices, which include leaving their their loved ones in the Philippines in order to get good-paying jobs abroad. Most of what they earn gets wired back to their families at home, amid their hope of one day lifting themselves out of poverty.
In turn, OFWs' money remittances keep the Philippine economy afloat year in and year out.
Marcos is currently in the US for a five-day visit. Aside from Biden, the Filipino leader has also met with Vice President Kamala Harris.

Romualdez, who has been in the US since mid-April, had laid the groundwork for Marcos' official visit to the US through a series of engagements with US officials and American business leaders.
He said the positive outcome of the meeting between Marcos and Biden, particularly the latter's announcement that he will send a presidential trade and investment mission, means that the Philippines can expect more job creation and economic growth.
“The prospect of a presidential trade and investment mission fills the nation with hope and optimism for a brighter future,” Romualdez said.
He said the House is ready to pass necessary legislations that would facilitate the entry of trade and investments from the US generated by the official visit of Marcos and to ensure these would all redound to the benefit of the Filipino people.
“We have already manifested our solid commitment to support the prosperity agenda of President Marcos by passing the necessary measures to help establish the Philippines as an ideal destination for foreign investments. We will continue to do so,” Romualdez said.

39,BOC exceeds April 2023 collection target,Aaron Recuenco,"May 3, 2023 ","The Bureau of Customs (BOC) has exceeded its collection target for April this year by almost four percent, attributing it to improved valuation of non-oil importation.
Working on the April 2023 collection target of P68.199 billion, the BOC has collected P68.274 billion, or 3.97 percent higher from the target. 
In a statement, the BOC said its collection performance could be attributed to its higher rate of assessment, which is mainly due to improved valuation of non-oil importation.
BOC Commissioner Bienvenido Y. Rubio said the April 2023 data shows consistency in beating monthly collection targets since January this year.
The BOC’s total revenue collection for the first four months of 2023 reached P281.902 billion, surpassing the target collection of P265.220 billion by 6.29 percent or P16.682 billion. 
This year's collection is also 10.89 percent higher than the previous year's collection of P254.226 billion for the same period.
In addition, the BOC recorded its highest daily collection for the year on April 28, amounting to over P7.51 billion. 
Rubio said the good performance is an encouraging indication of the agency's continued efforts to improve its collection performance.
“The BOC's consistent increase in revenue collection is a positive development for the Philippine government, as it strives to generate revenue to fund its various programs and projects,” said Rubio.
 
""We will continue to uphold our commitment to transparency, accountability, and service excellence as we strive to meet our revenue targets and contribute to the growth and development of our country,"" he added.

40,"Bong Go urges China to stop all forms of bullying, encroachment in the West PH Sea",Hannah Torregoza,"May 3, 2023 ","Senator Christopher “Bong” Go on Wednesday, May 3 has called on China to stop all forms of bullying and encroachment activities in the West Philippine Sea (WPS).
 
Go said he is committed to defend the country’s sovereignty rights and standing up against any intrusion on its territorial waters.
 
""You know we Filipinos, we are a small country, but Filipinos are brave. So I'm begging you, if what the bullying is true, if it's bullying, I'm begging you to stop bullying Filipinos,” said Go, vice chairman of the Senate Committee on National Defense in a recent ambush interview.
 
“Because we are Filipinos we will fight for what is ours. What is ours is ours. That's ours. So stop using violence or bullying.  Just because we are a small country, we will be oppressed, don't do that. Let’s maintain respect,"" he further stressed.
 
Last April 23, a day after Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang visited Manila and met with President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) claimed the China Coast Guard (CSG) used “dangerous maneuvers” to block its much smaller vessel causing the near-collision of two of their coast guard ships near Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal. 
 
Last February, the PCG had also reported an incident in which a Chinese security vessel allegedly used a military-grade laser against a Philippine patrol boat in the disputed waters.
 
As tensions in the WPS persist, the senator called for unity in dealing with the challenges posed by China’s assertiveness in the region. He emphasized the importance of defending national interests and promoting peaceful resolutions to territorial disputes, as what former president Rodrigo Duterte did.
 
""As started by (former) president (Rodrigo) Duterte, it is the State's mandate to protect, promote, and fight for what is ours. He doesn't want to fight but it is important that we fight for the country's interest and fight for what is ours,"" he stressed.

41,Water allocation cut for irrigation to start May 10- NWRB,Manila Bulletin,"May 3, 2023 ","Amid the looming water supply problems due to El Niño, the National Water Resource Board (NWRB) has decided to cut the water allocation for irrigation in various parts of the country starting May 10.
NWRB Executive Director David Sevillo Jr. said the move is aimed at ensuring sufficient water supply for the next cropping season, especially amid projection of reduction of water with the declaration of the start of El Nińo by the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa).
Sevillo explained that the reduction of water supply to irrigation will not totally affect farming since there is already a low demand for water from the farm sector since the harvest season is nearing.
In the past weeks, several government agencies, water concessionaires,  have been encouraging the public to conserve and practice recycling of water.
The appeals came after Pagasa  raised to 80 percent the probability of El Nino hitting the country this year and might continue to be experienced until the first quarter of 2024.
For its part, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS)  appealed to local government units in Metro Manila to pose an ordinance regulating the water supply for certain establishments.
Among these establishments include golf courses, car wash services, and resorts with swimming pools. These establishments are known to consume a massive volume of water to operate daily.
According to MWSS data, a golf course consumes at least 700 to 1400 cubic per month, while a car wash business spends 60 to 100 cubic, enough to supply the needs of more than 2,000 households.
The NWRB, however, assured the public that the water supply of Angat Dam can suffice the needs of Metro Manila residents. Although still encouraged the general public to continue to conserve water.
Angat Dam's Water Level is still considered at a normal level, based on the Pagasa's water level update at 6 a.m. on May 1.
More than 90 percent of Metro Manila's potable water requirements are met by the Angat Dam, which also meets the irrigation demands of 25,000 hectares of agriculture in Bulacan and Pampanga.
On the part of the water concessionaires, both the Maynilad and Manila also shared some tips on how to recycle water aside from calling on the public to conserve water.
They also eminded the public to report to authorities any leaks in water pipes as this is one of the most common causes of water wastage. (Nicole Magmanlac)

42,SC on anti-terrorism cases: Protect public but respect human rights,Rey G. Panaligan,"May 3, 2023 ","The Supreme Court (SC) declared that in resolving cases on the anti-terrorism law, the judicial rules must be “responsive to the need of protecting individual fundamental freedoms while allowing the State effective law enforcement for the protection of the public.”
Thus stressed the SC through Chief Justice Alexander G. Gesmundo on Wednesday, May 3, in his speech before the participants in the dialogue on the proposed judicial rules on anti-terrorism and counter-terrorism financing cases.
The dialogue until Friday, May 5, is being held in Mandaue City in Cebu. It is conducted with the help of the Australian Embassy, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Asia Foundation.
Retired Chief Justice Reynato S. Puno is the chairperson of the Ad Hoc Committee for the Formulation of the Special Rules of Procedure on Anti-Terrorism Cases.  The committee drafted the rules.
Thirty-seven petitions were filed challenging the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 11479, the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) of 2020.  ATA was enacted on July 3, 2020 and enforced starting July 18, 2020.
On Dec. 7, 2021, the SC handed down a decision which ruled as constitutional almost all the provisions of ATA.  The decision became final on April 22, 2022.
Declared unconstitutional by the SC were:
1. “The qualifier to the proviso in Section 4 of RA 11479, i.e., ‘... which are not intended to cause death or serious physical harm to a person, to endanger a person’s life, or to create a serious risk to public safety’ by a vote of 12-3 is declared as unconstitutional for being overbroad and violative of freedom of expression.
2. “The second method for designation in Section 25 paragraph 2 of RA 11479, i.e., ‘Request for designation by other jurisdictions or supranational jurisdictions may be adopted by the ATC (Anti-Terrorism Council) after determination that the proposed designee meets the criteria for designation of UNSCR (United Nations Security Council Resolution) No. 1373.’”
The SC ruled that “on the basis of the current petitions, all the other challenged provisions of RA 11479 are not unconstitutional.”
It stressed the “immense responsibility” of the government to defend the country against terrorism as well as the noticeably improving capabilities of terrorists to wreak havoc through weapons of mass destruction.
The SC has drafted the rules of procedure in the handling of anti-terrorism case.  It decided to hold a dialogue to get feedbacks from various stakeholders.
In his message, Chief Justice Gesmundo said “it became imperative to provide for a set of procedural rules to protect the fundamental rights of persons and entities from the ill effects brought about by abuses in the implementation of inherently overbroad penal statutes.”
He said the SC “found it necessary to promulgate a procedural framework both to demarcate a zone of legitimacy for acts by law enforcers as well as to delineate judicial reliefs against potential abuses of state agents.”
“Creating a procedural framework to balance effective law enforcement and protection of fundamental rights is akin to walking on a legal tightrope,“ he said.
He pointed out: “Procedures that lean heavily in favor of law enforcement will expose the fundamental rights of persons to the danger of abuses; while those that lean intensely in favor of liberties will expose the population’s lives and safety to the devastating effects of terrorism.”
“In this context, the ‘Rule of Law,’ as expressed in the proposed judicial rules on anti-terrorism cases, aims to protect the public’s right to life and safety and the individual civil liberties – both essential for the enjoyment of the blessings of democracy as espoused by the Constitution. After all, public interest is but an aggregate of private interests – all of which deserve equal protection,” he stressed.
At the same time, Gesmundo pointed out that “terrorism, as a crime with varying definitions, is commonly understood as a systematic attack with the use of fear and violence tending to undermine the stability of established governments, usually with the appearance of spontaneity that produces widespread and devastating effect on the populace and vital institutions.”
Due to terrorism’s “cataclysmic effect and unpredictability, the United Nations Security Council issued several resolutions calling for preventive measures, he said.
The Philippine Congress, he said responded by updating the Human Security Act (HSA) of 2007 and enacting the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020.
Gesmundo said the SC “encountered compelling concerns on the protection of due process rights in some sections of the ATA which provide for ex parte proceedings such as surveillance authorizations, designations, bank inquiries, and freeze orders.”
“In these proceedings, the rights of those in absentia are vulnerable to unjustified State intrusions – especially privacy rights. This is the reason why the principle of ‘effective judicial protection’ has been made to apply in ex parte proceedings of the ATA to afford adequate protection of the absentee’s fundamental rights. Consistent with the previous concern on perceived absence of remedies in some parts of the ATA, the proposed rules on anti-terrorism cases provide various reliefs against wrongful ex parte actions, either by the State or by the courts themselves,” he said.
He also said that with the rapid advancement of technology, “we recognize the need to allow a more proactive approach to security to prevent terrorist activities.”
But he said that “while we accept the necessity for urgent and enhanced security measures, these must be done within the confines of the law, with proper checks and balances, to guarantee that there is no undue or excessive intrusion to our rights and freedoms.”
He stressed that “true to its mandate, the Supreme Court is here to ensure that any measure in this regard will be based only on clear legal authority and must adhere strictly to proper procedure.”
He expressed hopes that “the members of the judiciary as well as other stakeholders invited in this activity will share their concerns on the substantive laws and their suggestions on judicial procedures so that the proposed ATA Rules can, all the more, achieve its objective of protecting fundamental rights under the backdrop of effective law enforcement.”

43,Pimentel seeks Senate probe into delayed release of national IDs,Mario Casayuran,"May 3, 2023 ","Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III has filed a resolution seeking to investigate why there is a delay in the issuance of the national identification cards (national ID) by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).
“Given the unreasonably prolonged delivery, questionable usefulness, and substandard quality of the national IDs, there is already cause to believe that there is malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance on the part of the leadership in the PSA, the BSP, and other relevant agencies in fulfilling its mandate under Republic Act No. 11055,” Pimentel said in filing Senate Resolution No. 585.
The resolution, which was filed yesterday May 2, directs the Senate Blue Ribbon to conduct an inquiry, in aid of legislation, on the long delayed issuance of the national ID cards.
“We are concerned about the delay in the issuance of these cards. It is crucial that the government takes immediate steps to resolve the issue and ensure that all citizens have access to their national ID,” Pimentel said in a statement on Wednesday.
“The government should take swift action to address the issue and provide a clear timeline for when Filipinos can receive their national IDs,” he added.
According to Section 3 of Republic Act No. 11055, the Philippine Identification System or PhilSys was established primarily to provide a valid proof of identity for all citizens and resident aliens as a means of simplifying public and private transactions.
“Apart from the delay in meeting the quota for the number of ID cards to be accomplished, there have been complaints about inaccuracy of personal information and blurry images on the cards,” the resolution states.
In some cases, the IDs are no longer readable after three months, it notes.
The resolution cited the Commission on Audit (COA) findings that as of the end of 2021, the BSP delivered only 27,356,750 pre-personalized cards or 76 percent of the 36 million required number of IDs for 2021. 
The figure is far from the 116 million pre-personalized IDs that BSP has to deliver from 2021 to 2023. 
“Even the usefulness of the ID is in question, as some financial institutions refused to recognize the national ID because it lacks the holder’s signature,” Pimentel said in the resolution.

44,LPA in Mindanao could become a tropical depression — PAGASA,Ellalyn De Vera-Ruiz,"May 3, 2023 ","The low pressure area (LPA) over Misamis Oriental may become a tropical depression within 48 hours, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said on Wednesday, May 3.
Around 10 a.m., the LPA was over the coast of Laguindingan, Misamis Oriental and is expected to bring light to occasional heavy rains to Bicol Region, Visayas, Northern Mindanao, Caraga, and Davao Region in the next 24 hours.
“This weather disturbance has a chance to develop into a tropical depression within the next 48 hours,” PAGASA said in an advisory issued at 11:30 a.m.
PAGASA warned against potential flooding or landslides caused by moderate to heavy rains, particularly in areas that had recently received a significant amount of precipitation.
The public and concerned disaster risk reduction and management offices were advised to take all necessary precautionary measures.
Meanwhile, PAGASA said the rest of the country will continue to experience partly cloudy to cloudy weather with isolated rain showers or thunderstorms
The public is advised to exercise caution as severe thunderstorms may cause landslides or flash floods, especially in areas that are vulnerable to these hazards.

45,Tulfo announces probe on power generation firms' 'greedy' practices ​,Mario Casayuran,"May 3, 2023 ","Senator Raffy Tulfo deplored the sky-high charges of energy generation companies (gencos) despite the drop in prices of coal in the global price index.
Compared to other countries in Asia, Philippines has one of the highest electricity costs even though the price of coal imports is all based on the Indonesian Coal Index and the New Castle Index, Tulfo said in a statement issued Wednesday, May 3.
To address the issue and discuss why the abusive practice by gencos was allowed to persist for decades, Tulfo, chairman of the Senate energy committee, immediately held a virtual consultative meeting with the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) and the Department of Energy (DOE) last Monday, May 1. 
“Kaya sobrang mahal ng kuryente sa Pilipinas ay dahil matagal na pala tayong piniprito sa sarili nating mantika ng mga gahamang energy generation company (We have been fried by rapacious energy generation. Companies),” he said.
Tulfo also said that coal prices in the global market have been plummeting but the charges of generation companies remain high in the Philippines, allowing big gencos supplying electricity in the country to earn hundreds of millions, to even billions, daily.
""In fact, of the reasons why many foreign investors are hesitant to set up their business in the Philippines is because of the expensive electricity cost. In turn, these foreign investors prefer to go to other countries with cheaper electricity charges, such as Malaysia and Vietnam,"" he said.
In the consultative meeting, ERC chairperson Monalisa Dimalanta admitted that the high charge of gencos has been a longstanding and persistent problem.
Dimalanta likewise shared that ERC has already written a letter to gencos asking them to explain the basis for their sky-high charge. 
She said that one of these companies claimed that they cannot divulge such information due to confidentiality, which angered Tulfo.
Asked to further share ERC’s response to said genco’s refusal to cooperate, Dimalanta said they already issued a show cause order obligating the generation companies to comply but to no avail.
Until now, not even a single genco complied with ERC’s order.
The Senator from Isabela and Davao also asked Dimalanta if there is a need for legislation to set a limitation on the rate of returns of gencos, to which she replied that not as of the moment because ERC will be the one to solve the issue.
Meanwhile, Tulfo said that DOE promised that they are ready to impose necessary sanctions to uncompliant gencos, which includes obliging the latter to give their customers a refund. 
Tulfo said he would get back to ERC and DOE through a public hearing come opening of the session in Senate to finally put a stop to the abuse of gencos to Filipino consumers.

46,Rodriguez calls China a 'frenemy'; says even Digong got fed up,Ellson Quismorio,"May 3, 2023 ","China isn't the Philippines' friend, but rather its frenemy.
Cagayan de Oro 2nd district Rep. Rufus Rodriguez gave this description of China in the context of President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.'s ongoing and so far productive trip to the United States (US).
“China is not a friend. It is a frenemy. It is an interloper in the West Philippine Sea,” Rodriguez said in a statement Wednesday, May 3.
According to the Mindanao solon, the ""aggressive, harassment and bullying activities"" of China in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) “are pushing our country to be closer to its long-time ally, the United States"".
“The US is our only defense treaty ally. They are bound to come to our defense under our 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty. US officials have repeatedly declared that their obligations under the treaty would kick in the moment a foreign power attack us, including in the South China Sea. That is very reassuring,” said the House Committee on Constitutional Amendments chairman.
A ""frenemy"" refers to ""a person with whom one is friendly, despite a fundamental dislike or rivalry"" or ""a person who combines the characteristics of a friend and an enemy"", as per Wikipedia. It is a an oxymoron and a portmanteau of ""friend"" and ""enemy"".
Rodriguez said he believes most Filipinos support Marcos' decision to cultivate again the friendly relations that had existed between the Philippines and the US during the time of his late father, President Ferdinand Marcos Sr.
“Those ties have been disrupted by the ouster of the US military bases during the Aquino administration and by the previous government’s so-called ‘China pivot’,” he noted.
He pointed out that despite the efforts of then-president Rodrigo Duterte to hammer out closer ties between Manila and Beijing, the country “received only empty promises of assistance and loans"" that did not materialize from China.
Rodriguez noted that toward the end of his term, Duterte was so frustrated that he ordered the termination of negotiations for some Chinese loans.
“Chinese harassment and bullying of our Coast Guard patrols and fishermen continued inside our own 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the [WPS], from Pangasinan and Zambales in the north to Palawan in the south,” he said.
Marcos is currently in the US for a five-day visit. He has already met with US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.

This, after former Philippine National Police (PNP) chief general Rodolfo Azurin, Jr. initiated the donation of four more electric-tricycles to the Malay Police Station in a bid to further improve police presence in Boracay while responding to international calls to combat climate change.
Police Lt. Col. Don Dicksie De Dios, chief of police of Malay Municipal Police Station, said the new vehicles are a big boost to their morale as some of their mobility assets are already old and dilapidated.
“We are thankful to our fomer Chief PNP, general Rodolfo Azurin, Jr. for the additional four e-trickes. They will boost the capabilities of Malay PNP and improve the mobility of our personnel to immediately respond to calls for help and assistance and to ensure a strengthened mobile patrol in the Island of Boracay,” said De Dios during the turnover ceremony.
Western Visayas regional police chief Brig. Gen. Leo Francisco said the e-trikes will used to increase police presence in Boracay Island which is one of the top tourist destinations in the world.
The four e-trikes were in addition to the two e-trikes also donated under Azurin’s leadership last year.
The six e-trikes were funded undet the PNP modernization program.
Present during the turnover ceremony were Azurin, Francisco, Aklan Police Provincial Office director Col. Crisaleo Tolentino and Malay Mayor Floribar Bautista.

48,"Senate bill seeks automatic refund for telco, ISP service interruptions",Hannah Torregoza,"May 3, 2023 ","A bill seeking to compel telecommunication companies (Telcos) and internet service providers (ISPs) to provide automatic refund to subscribers who experience service interruptions has been filed in the Senate.
 
Sen. Jinggoy Ejercito Estrada, author of Senate Bill No. 2074, said Telcos and ISPs should be able to refund its subscribers when they experience service disruptions at least 24 hours accumulated in a month.
 
Estrada said a refund should be in order if the service outages would accumulate to 24 hours in a month, reminding consumers “serbisyo ang binabayaran natin (We are paying for services).”
 
“Kapag hindi ka nakabayad ng iyong bill sa itinakda nilang due date ng pagbabayad, mabilis pa sa alas kwatro ang pagputol nila ng linya. Kung hindi rin naman nila matutumbasan ang serbisyong binabayaran natin, dapat ikaltas ito sa ating mga bayarin (When you don't pay your bill by the payment due date they set, they cut the line as fast as four o'clock. If they can't match the service we pay for, it should be deducted from our bills),” Estrada said.
 
“Bakit tayo magbabayad sa serbisyong hindi naman natin napakinabangan? At sa panahon na halos nakadepende ang bawat galaw natin sa mga gadgets at digital devices, mahalaga ang pagkakaroon ng mabilis, accessible at reliable connection (Why should we pay for a service that we have not benefited from? And at a time when our every move is almost dependent on gadgets and digital devices, it is important to have a fast, accessible and reliable connection),” he also said.
 
SB 2074, or the proposed Refund for Internet and Telecommunications Service Outages and Disruptions Act, primarily seeks to require public telecommunication entities (PTEs) and ISPs to institute a mechanism that will enable them to automatically refund or adjust the bills of their postpaid and prepaid subscribers whenever there are service disruptions. 
 
The bill particularly seeks to amend Section 20 of Republic Act 7925, otherwise known as the Public Telecommunications Policy Act of the Philippines, to include a section mandating  refund credit to clients who experienced a service outage and disruption for an aggregate period of 24 hours or more within a month. 
 
The refund credit shall also be granted to customers subscribing to a service on a prepaid basis. 
 
“Genuine accessibility can only be achieved if the connection services are regular, reliable, consistent, uninterrupted, and fast to allow continuity of activities and interconnection among different users,” the senator said. 
 
“This measure intends to implement fair charging of services of telcos and ISPs to the consumers. It is important that they receive the service that is worth every cent that they pay, and they will not be charged for the service that they were not able to avail of,” the lawmaker reiterated.

In filing Senate Resolution 579, Poe said it is time to put in place a long-term solution to the power woes which have been severely impacting on the daily lives of residents and economic activities in the region.
""Recurring power interruptions and massive blackouts should not be a way of life for our people in Panay Island,"" she said.
Poe is the chairperson of the Senate Committee on Public Services.
""Concerned agencies must get a handle on the problem to end the intolerable suffering of the residents,"" she pointed out.
Poe stressed the need to determine the root cause of the grid disturbances reported by the  National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) allegedly due to the tripping of distribution utilities (DUs).
At the same time, the inquiry should delve into the position of electric cooperatives in Panay and Negros pointing to the NGCP as the cause of the problem, Poe said.
An electric cooperative cited a voltage fluctuation and frequency imbalance in a line under the management of the NGCP.
""There is an urgent need to determine the root of these grid disturbances, implement remedial measures and determine who shall be held liable to finally put an end to the blame-shifting between NGCP and the DUs, and ascertain possible franchise violations,""  she pointed out.
""There is also a need to look into the long-term solutions to the power interruptions and outages within the backdrop of the 'thin' supply of power in the Visayas grid,"" she added.

The company, which operates under the name of Sunpower Philippines Manufacturing Ltd., is a global leader in solar technology and innovation.
This was announced during President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s and his delegation’s meeting with officials of Maxeon in Washington D.C. on Tuesday, May 2 (US time).
The President met with business leaders in a series of meetings at the Blair House in a bid to attract more investments to the country.
In a statement released by the Presidential Communications Office (PCO), Bill Mulligan, chief executive officer (CEO) of Maxeon which operates the SunPower brand in all global markets including in the US, Canada and Japan, revealed that the investment would provide more than 3,000 jobs in the next few years.
During the meeting, Mulligan expressed his company’s confidence on the Marcos administration, citing this as reason his company plans to expand in the Philippines.
“The Philippines has been incredibly important… it’s actually a strategic part of our company. And I want to thank you and I want to thank all of the government agencies for all of the help and the support for the 40 plus years that we’ve been in the country,” he said.
So far, Maxeon Sunpower has started the expansion of their research and development (R&D) facility in Cavite, providing around 2,000 engineering jobs in the area.

51,Poe faults MIAA for power outages,Mario Casayuran,"May 3, 2023 ","Senator Grace Poe on Wednesday, May 3, faulted the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) for the power outage problems at the country’s major gateway.
Poe issued the statement following reports that the MIAA is asking for a P1-billion budget for the purchase of power generators that would supply electricity in four NAIA terminals.
The chairwoman of the Senate public services committee pointed out that the extra P1-billion necessary to provide back up power could be subsidized through the national budget’s unprogrammed funds or even through the revolving funds from airport operations.
""The question is, if they knew that the existing backup power can only support 30 percent of the terminals power requirement, why did they not propose to procure back up generators during our budget hearings last year?"" she asked.
""Clearly, they have been remiss in their duties, by not proposing an upgraded back up system,’’ she said.
""There was a full electrical audit conducted  in 2017? We would like to know, what were the recommendations? Why did  past and present NAIA administrations fail to comply with the recommended upgrades,’’ she added.
Meanwhile, Sen. Sonny Angara, chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, said the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) should include in next year's budget MIAA's request for P1-billion.
Angara said the amount should be included when the DBM submits the National Expenditure Program (NEP) to Congress after President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.'s State of the Nation Address (SONA).
Asked if the Executive department can submit a supplemental budget to Congress, Angara said this is ""one possibility"" but this is dependent on the availability of funds.
""The use of savings is another possibility,"" he added.

This, after an embarrassing eight-hour power outage struck NAIA on Monday, May 1, causing the delay or cancelation of dozens of flights.
""Sabi ng Department of Transportation (DOTr), magkakaroon ang NAIA ng electrical system audit. Kung maraming sakit, bakit hindi gawing complete check-up, para malapatan ng tamang lunas? (According to the DOTr, the NAIA will undergo an electrical system audit. If there are many ailments, why not make it a complete check-up so that we'll come up with the right cure?)"" Recto said.
""And whatever work to be done should be submitted as one package, so the remedies will not be several Band Aid of cures, but a wellness package,"" noted the former Senate President Pro Tempore.
The Labor Day airport blackout lasted nearly eight hours. It brought back unsavory memories of the Jan. 1, 2023 NAIA power outage, which similarly pestered thousands of passengers.
Recto believes that money isn't the problem with NAIA. ""May pera naman kasi (There is money). NAIA is a corporate profit center for the government. It is not a charity.""
""The gross revenues of Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA), which runs NAIA, in 2019 was P15.2 billion,"""" he pointed out.

55,DPWH warns vs illegal solicitations,Chito Chavez,"May 3, 2023 ","The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) warned its personnel, contractors, suppliers and other clients with legitimate business transactions in the department never to fall prey to unscrupulous groups using the names of its officials to solicit funds supposedly for worthy projects or any unknown purposes.
This warning came about as reports continue to pile up that unscrupulous groups pry on the unsuspecting DPWH officials and personnel to ask for financial assistance for their personal needs or other various reasons, which the department asserted were unlawful and unauthorized.
Reports also disclosed that certain communications for DPWH Secretary Manuel Bonoan were coursed through email addresses ﻿﻿manuelbonoandpwh@gmail.com, ﻿﻿osec@dpwh.gov.ph and
﻿﻿salamhush9@gmail.com.
“Let it be known that Secretary Bonoan has neither used nor has access to any of the email addresses mentioned above, and all transactions sent thru such will not be recognized by the Office of the Secretary, the DPWH warned.
The DPWH reminded the public that “for official communication purposes, the only legitimate email address used by the DPWH Secretary is bonoan.manuel@dpwh.gov.ph.’’
In view of these fraudulent occurrences, DPWH Undersecretary for Information Management and Technical Service Maximo Carvajal issued a statement stating that he has “neither solicited nor authorized any solicitations in any form and any purpose, and shall in no way do or cause the doing of the same.’’
He made the pronouncement after receiving information that unscrupulous persons ‘using my name and/or posing as my staff’ solicited money for various reasons.’
In another instance, DPWH Region 7 Director Ernesto Gregorio Jr. made a similar call cationing the public against ‘fake solicitation.’
He issued the clarification after certain unscrupulous personnel were soliciting money or any favor using and acting as staff of the DPWH Regional 7 Office.
“Let it be known that the undersigned (Gregorio) has neither solicited nor authorized any solicitations in any form and for any purpose, and shall in no way do or cause the doing of the same,’’ Gregorio noted in a statement.
“All offices and private individuals are enjoined to refrain from entertaining any kind of solicitation, allegedly for and, in behalf, of Regional Director Ernesto S. Gregorio Jr., are unauthorized, unlawful and should be disregarded,’’ the statement added.
The fraudulent acts of the unscrupulous groups went a step further when a person claiming to be DPWH Undersecretary Ardeliza Medenilla called a supplier of goods to solicit money.
Known to be a person of high integrity, the DPWH said “Undersecretary Medenilla adheres to the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees (Republic Act 6713) which prohibits officials and employees from soliciting money and will not resort to any unauthorized government transactions.’’
There was also a case when an individual called up the DPWH offices particularly in Mindanao using the name of DPWH-Stakeholders Relations Service (SES) Director Randy del Rosario to obtain vital personal contact details of the DPWH regional and central office officials.
Del Rosario appealed to the concerned parties to assist the SRS in its bid to take action against the unscrupulous persons through the DPWH Central Office numbers 5304-3280 and 5304-3370.
The caution was issued to clear del Rosario’s name and “prevent any fraud and avoid furthering deceitful schemes.’’
The DPWH had reiterated its warning after getting information that cash deposits have been made by at least one supplier to the bank accounts of two unscrupulous individuals in response to a scam in the form of solicitation of people posing as DPWH officials.
“RA (Republic Act) 1405 otherwise known as “The Bank Secrecy Law’’ precludes the department from getting from the depository banks information about the account holders to conduct further investigation into this scam. In this regard, the Department is appealing to these account holders or people who know them or know the people who opened these accounts to report to the DPWH any information that can help us investigate this scam,’’ the DPWH stated.

During a meeting with President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr., John Padget, president and CEO of Carnival Corp., said his group of companies will employ Filipino seafarers.
He praised Filipino workers for their hospitality and competitiveness in the global workforce.
“It doesn’t matter whether it’s the marine, deck, hospitality, restaurant…everything is based on the happiness, the smile, and the greatness of the Filipino employees,” he said.
Padget also represents Carnival Cruise Line, Holland American Airlines and Seaborn.
With this development, Marcos thanked US employers for their continued confidence in Filipino professionals and skilled workers.
“When you say that the ladies and gentlemen that we have here today represent 200,000, you do not represent 200,000 employees, you represent 200,000 families and you represent 200,000 communities in the Philippines,” Marcos told the employers.
There are more than four million Filipino immigrants (temporary and permanent) in the US, representing the fourth largest immigrant group after Mexicans, Indians and Chinese.
Through their remittances, Filipino workers contribute to the economic development of both the US and Philippines with their skills, talents, and expertise.

In a series of meetings here on Tuesday afternoon, May 2, Marcos received the good news from business process outsourcing (BPO) company Atento and vaccine maker Moderna.
Atento will put up its first call center in the Philippines at the Iloilo Business Park in Madurriao, Iloilo.
Marcos told Atento officials—Atento President Fili Ledezma Soto and Chief Delivery Officer Josh Ashby—that they made the right decision in choosing the Philippines as their location as “Filipinos speak and write the best English.”
“I know it will be successful because it has been successful in the past. It has been a go-to industry for the Philippine government for quite a long time now,” Marcos said.
“I don’t see how it could be a problem since this is really a line of work that has become well established in the Philippines,” he added.
Atento is a customer relationship management and business process outsourcing company operating in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Morocco, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Spain, Uruguay, and the US.
Atento is projected to provide employment opportunities for around 554 workers in the first year and 665 workers in the second year, bringing in a significant investment of P21.4 million.
Vaccine-making facility
Vaccine maker Moderna has told the President that it is setting up a facility in the Philippines to service the Asia-Pacific region.
Moderna Chief Commercial Officer Arpa Garay and Senior Vice President and General Manager Patrick Bergstedt said they are set to establish a “Shared Service Facility for Pharmacovigilance” to provide more employment opportunities to health professionals in the country.
“We are really excited to have selected the Philippines for the third one primarily because you know the capabilities exist. We have the talent that exists, and we know that the partnership will be one that can be beneficial for both Moderna and the Philippines,” Garay said.
According to Bergstedt, the Philippines is the “perfect location” for their third shared service facility in the world, following Poland and Georgia in the US.
It will be Moderna’s only shared service facility in Asia, and is expected to employ around 50 staff composed of health professionals with their shortlisted office location either in Makati or at the Bonifacio Global City in Taguig.
The project will also be the first investment by Moderna in the Philippines and in Asia.
Marcos expressed gratitude to Moderna saying, it will give the country advantage in healthcare.
“The opportunity to build shared services in areas of interest, connecting with the scientific, academic opportunity with Moderna, the ministry of health is something that we’re very, very interested in. The most important part is that we sat down and drew the program, and say this is how we approach the problem … Those are the kind of skills that we need. With your experience in other countries, there are many lessons that we could learn that can be applied in the Philippines,” Marcos said.
Moderna was among the pharmaceutical companies that pioneered the production of Covid-19 vaccines, which were distributed to the Philippines at the height of the pandemic.
US-PH society's economic commitment
The US-Philippines Society, co-chaired by US Ambassador John D. Negropotente, has vowed for greater cooperation and partnership in the development and economy of the Philippines.
Negropotente made the commitment following the group’s meeting with Marcos also on Tuesday afternoon. He noted that the visit of the President laid the framework for the commitment of the group to support Manila.
“(The) President’s visit… sets the table for our work, of US-Philippine Society in the months and years ahead, thank you for that,” he told Marcos.
Also known as The Society, the USPS is a non-profit, bi-national organization of prominent civic and business leaders of the US and the Philippines. Negroponte co-chairs it with Filipino businessman Manuel V. Pangilinan.
The Society was organized in May 2012 with the aim of enhancing awareness of the profile of the Philippines in the United States in the areas of security, trade, investments, tourism, the environment, history, education and culture.
Meanwhile, a top IBM executive Michael DiPaula Coyle said they are very bullish on the Philippine economy, and looks forward to working with the government to invest in digitalization.
“We’re also very heavily invested in helping grow your talent pool through skills development programs, we’ve had a number of partnerships with the US government with your government to improve skills development particularly in areas like… AI and cybersecurity where I think the Philippines has an enormous opportunity to position yourselves as a very competitive economy particularly in the IT services sector,” said Coyle, head of IBM’s International Trade Policy Government and Regulatory Affairs.
These meetings took place on the third day of Marcos' visit in the US.

58,Marcos keen on nuclear fuel technology use vs PH power crisis,Raymund Antonio,"May 3, 2023 ","Amid the country’s power crisis, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. is eyeing “cutting-edge” micro nuclear fuel technology developed by a United States-based firm that brings safe, clean, and cost-effective electricity to consumers.
Several provinces—most notably Occidental Mindoro which experienced 20-hour daily power outages—have suffered from massive blackouts for several weeks before the Marcos administration negotiated with the owner of three power plants in the province to resume their operations.
The Chief Executive, who is in Washington to meet with US President Joe Biden and hold several other meetings, discussed the potentials of the new technology with officials of Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC), a US-based firm global leader and vertical integrator of nuclear technologies and services.
Francesco Venneri, chief executive officer (CEO) of Ultra Safe Nuclear Corp., expressed interest in bringing clean and reliable nuclear energy to the Philippines, describing the move as “probably a very important way for us to enter the market.”
The official revealed that his company is seriously considering the Philippines for its first nuclear energy facility in Southeast Asia, signaling such interest with his knowledge about the series of blackouts in the country.
“We also note that there’s a great deal of discussion about Mindoro having blackouts and that might be an excellent….a good science [solution],” Venneri said.
The micro modular reactor (MMR) energy system is described by USNC officials as a fourth generation nuclear energy system that seeks to deliver safe, clean, and cost-effective electricity to users.
Considered as the first “fission battery” in commercialization, the MMR is currently being licensed in Canada and the US.
But since the company is expecting a heavy demand for its MMRs and nuclear fuel, it sees the potential of the Philippines as a nuclear hub in the region.

59,"China must respect int'l law, arbitral ruling to minimize incidents in SCS --- US official",Joseph Pedrajas,"May 3, 2023 ","The United States has told China to respect freedom of navigation and honor the 2016 Arbitral Ruling related to the South China Sea to avoid repetition of the near collision incidents between Chinese and Philippine vessels in the contested waterway.
US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Kritenbrink said Washington is ""deeply concerned"" about Beijing's ""continued intimidation and harassment of Philippine vessels"" as its coast guard once again held a dangerous maneuver against its Filipino counterpart.
On April 19 and 23, Chinese vessels had blocked the path of Philippine vessels on patrol mission in the Ayungin Shoal, which led to a near collision incident between the two ships.
Speaking at an online press conference on Wednesday morning (Manila time), Kritenbrink said such actions and behavior ""is truly unacceptable"" and the US ""will continue to track and monitor those interactions.""
According to Kritenbrink, ""the best way to prevent such instances in the future would be for the PRC (People's Republic of China) to make a commitment to uphold the rules-based international order.""
He also urged Beijing to respect the ""freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and to abide by the 2016 Arbitral Tribunal ruling which of course is binding on both parties."" The 2016 ruling affirmed the Philippine claim over the West Philippine Sea, a part of the bigger South China Sea.
""We again call upon Beijing to desist from its unprovocative and unsafe conduct,"" Kritenbrink said.
He said the US would continue regularly operating in the contested waterway to ""demonstrate the principle that all countries should be able to, or are able to fly. sail and operate anywhere where international law allows.""
With a strengthened military alliance between the US and the Philippines, the official also said it was ""somewhat puzzling"" for China to claim that the Western giant is dragging Manila into conflict in the Taiwan Strait.
Kritenbrink said the US and the Philippines ""share vision for [a] peaceful and stable region,"" so it is concerning for him why China would make such a claim.
""We support the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. We oppose unilateral efforts to change the status quo by either side and we insist that Cross Strait differences be resolved peacefully,"" he said.

In a meeting on Tuesday afternoon, May 2, President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. received the investment pledge made by American healthcare services provider Optum, a part of UnitedHealth Group (UHG).
Optum President John Prince said the firm is committed to the Philippines, and lauded the ""strategic partnership that we have for a very long time.""
""I’m a really big believer that great things happen to great teams and we have a great team in the Philippines,” said Prince, adding that the investment is part of the company’s efforts to broaden its operations.
In March this year, Optum met with the Board of Investments (BOI) to discuss details of their planned new project in Davao and queries on importation of equipment.
Since 2011, it has invested P5.1 billion in capital expenditure in operating four sites in Taguig, Muntinlupa, Quezon City, and Cebu City.
UHG’s Optum business in the country provides a broad range of healthcare information management services, including clinical, revenue cycle management, pharmacy services and benefit management, payment integrity, quality and risk adjustment, technology, and other services delivered across voice, non-voice and blended processes.
In one of his meetings on Tuesday, BPO company Atento said it is poised to build facilities in the Philippines, bringing more jobs to the country.
Atento will put up its first call center in the Philippines at the Iloilo Business Park in Madurriao, Iloilo.

61,"Romualdez confident Marcos can score gains in energy security, nuclear plans during US trip",Ellson Quismorio,"May 3, 2023 ","House Speaker Martin Romualdez believes President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. would be able to advance his energy security plan--which include tapping nuclear energy in the Philippines--during his ongoing visit to the United States (US).
Romualdez brought this up after Marcos met Wednesday, May 3 (Philippine time) with US Vice President Kamala Harris in Washington DC.
Romualdez witnessed the meeting firsthand at the Number One Observatory Circle, the official residence of the vice president of the US.
According to the Speaker Harris’ office bared the opening of negotiations on a civil nuclear cooperation agreement that will support nonproliferation priorities and zero-emission energy security initiatives of the Philippines.
“The availability of cheap and reliable supply of electricity is indispensable in our effort to attract investments that would create more jobs and livelihood opportunities for our people and so he is exploring all viable alternatives, including renewables and nuclear energy, to achieve this end,” Romualdez said.
“I am confident that President Marcos’ official visit to the US would further advance his administration’s efforts in the area of energy security,” added the Leyte 1st district congressman.
To help the Marcos administration achieve its vision for nuclear energy, the House leadership created in August 2022 the Special Committee on Nuclear Energy.
The jurisdiction of the nuclear energy panel is as follows: ""All matters directly and principally relating to the policies and programs for the production utilization and conservation of nuclear energy, including the development of nuclear power infrastructures as well as interaction of other energy sources with nuclear energy as a reliable cost competitive and environment-friendly; resource to ensure energy, energy security consistent with the national interest and the state's policy of freedom from nuclear weapons.""
Pangasinan 2nd district Rep. Mark Cojuangco chairs the Special Committee on Nuclear Energy.
Last Monday, a top US nuclear energy firm NuScale Power Corporation expressed during their meeting with Marcos their interest to invest in the Philippines and bared plans for a study to locate an appropriate site in the country for their advanced Small Modular Reactor (SMR).
NuScale officials said that an amount of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion worth of investment is needed to provide 430 megawatts (MW) to the country by 2030.

62,"Lunar eclipse, meteor shower to illuminate PH skies this weekend",Ellalyn De Vera-Ruiz,"May 3, 2023 ","A lunar eclipse and meteor shower will both be visible in the Philippines this weekend, said the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).
A lunar eclipse will take place from the evening of May 5 to the early morning of May 6, according to PAGASA’s astronomical diary for May.
“The moon will pass through 95 percent of the penumbral shadow and cause a minor darkening of the lunar surface, thus creating a penumbral lunar eclipse,” PAGASA said.
Anywhere where the moon is above the horizon will be able to see the penumbral lunar eclipse, including Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and Antarctica.
PAGASA said the astronomical event, which will last for four hours, 21 minutes, and 36 seconds, will be visible in the country between 11:12 p.m. on Friday and 3:34 a.m. on Saturday.
The maximum eclipse will occur at 1:23 a.m. on Saturday.
“Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to watch and do not require the use of any kind of protective filter for the eyes. A pair of binoculars may also be used to help magnify the view,” PAGASA said.

Sky-dazzling meteor shower
Another noteworthy celestial occurrence is the η-Aquariid meteor shower, which can be observed from April 19 to May 28.
PAGASA said it is a significant meteor shower produced by Comet Halley’s debris and will reach its peak on May 6.
“This meteor shower may produce about 40 meteors per hour in a very dark and cloudless condition,” PAGASA said.
“η-Aquariids is best observed shortly before dawn when their radiant is at its highest point in the sky. [However], the presence of a waning gibbous Moon, in the constellation Libra at the shower’s peak, will cause significant interference with the shower observation,” it added.
Another meteor shower that can be seen in May is called the η-Lyrids, which is active from May 3 to 14.
Its peak activity will happen on May 9, producing up to three meteors per hour.
“The finest shower display for observing η-Lyrids occurs around 4 a.m., when the radiant is at its highest point in the sky. This can be observed just before daybreak,” PAGASA said.
“[However], the waning gibbous moon in Sagittarius presents significant interference with the observation,” it pointed out.

63,"Zubiri urges DOE, NGCP to step up and solve Western Visayas blackouts",Mario Casayuran,"May 3, 2023 ","Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri on Wednesday, May 3,  asked the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) to solve the recurring blackouts in Western Visayas.
""The DOE and the NGCP  must  step  up  and  answer  for  the  massive blackouts  hitting  Western  Visayas.  These  are  no longer just  an inconvenience. They are a major problem  affecting  the  economy  and endangering the well-being of our people,” he said.
According to the NGCP, in late April, Western Visayas was hit by extensive blackouts, coinciding with  the  height  of the summer  season. 
The blackouts  have  also  led to many smaller businesses cutting down their operating hours. In February, the region also suffered a power outage that lasted ten hours, caused by a snake intrusion in rhe Panay Diesel Power Plant 1.
Zubiri said the frequency of these blackouts is alarming, and it is on the DOE and NGCP to get their act straight and find long-term solutions already. 
""A few minutes of power interruption every  once  in  a  while  is understandable, but frequent outages that last for hours and hours and cause loss of income is unforgivable. The DOE and the NGCP must answer to consumers,’’he stressed.
“If they find that we need to amend the EPIRA (Electric Power Industry Reform Act) , then we are open to that. The law is over two decades old, and can definitely be improved to help the power sector serve consumers better, and to help prevent recurring region-wide blackouts like this,” Zubiri said.
""We have received  the  administration’s  suggested  amendments to the EPIRA,  and  we  are  already  studying  these,  and  seeing how  these amendments can be further refined to best respond to the problems that we  are  hearing  about  from  the  power  sector  and especially  from consumers. But the  DOE  and  the  NGCP  must  still  come  forward  with  a  clear explanation  behind  the  blackouts,  and  more  importantly,  outline  a solution. We cannot let this be the norm. Our people deserve better than this kind of service,” he added.

64,Feast of Saints Philip and James on May 3,Christina Hermoso,"May 3, 2023 ","Roman Catholics commemorate on Wednesday, May 3, the Feast of Saints Philip and James, two of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ.
Popularly known as the “Foundation Stones of the Church,” the saints share a feast day because their sacred relics were brought together from the East to Rome.
The relics of the well-known saints may be found at the Church of the Holy Apostles in Rome, Italy. Pilgrims have been venerating the site as early as the year 563.
St. Philip was one of Jesus’ first disciples. He became His follower after Jesus’ baptism at the Jordan River. St. James the Less or the Younger was the brother of St. Jude. He served as the first bishop of Jerusalem and authored one of the Catholic Epistles in the New Testament, the Letter of St. James. He was called “the just” on account of his holiness.
Both were martyred for standing by their faith. Their names are mentioned in the first list in the Canon of the Mass.
Meanwhile, a concelebrated feast day mass will be presided over by Bishop Jose R. Rojas, Jr. at 8 a.m. at the Saints Philip and James Parish in Minalabac, Camarines Sur on May 3. The high mass coincides with the 440th parish fiesta having been built in 1583.
The grand procession was held on May 2 while the novenario was held from April 24 to May 2.

65,Go renews call for Filipinos not to be complacent vs Covid-19,Hannah Torregoza,"May 3, 2023 ","﻿Amid an increase of Covid-19 cases, Senator Christopher “Bong” Go renewed his call for Filipinos not to be complacent and to continue to follow health protocols and, if eligible, to get vaccinated.
 
Go, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, said it is critical to continue following health protocols to prevent the further spread of the virus.
 
“Proven naman po na ang bakuna po ang tanging susi o solusyon para unti-unti tayong makabalik sa normal nating pamumuhay. Kapag bakunado ka, mas protektado (It has been proven that getting vaccinated is the only key and solution for us to eventually return to our normal lives. If you are vaccinated, you are more protected),” Go said during an ambush interview in Calaca City, Batangas last May 1.
 
At the same time, the senator reminded the public to take care of the elderly, as they are at higher risk of getting infected.
 
Go reiterated the importance of using and wearing face mask especially in populous areas in the country and even at home.
 
“Maaaring mahawa natin ang ating mga lolo at lola sa (ating mga) pamamahay… mas delikado po (para sa kanila) dahil matatanda sila. Kung mahal natin ang ating mga magulang, mga lolo at lola, mas mabuti nang mas protektado tayo (Our elderly parents can get the disease even within inside our homes. It’s more dangerous for them because their age. If we love our parents, our grandfathers and grandmothers, it’s much better to stay protected),” he added.
 
The OCTA Research earlier noted that Metro Manila's seven-day positivity rate has risen to 14.3 percent on Thursday from 9 percent  the previous week. This is higher than the five percent benchmark recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
 
“Though, naiulat nga po na nasa low risk pa rin po ang occupancy rate ng mga alloted for COVID-19 beds, pero ‘wag tayong maging kumpiyansa. Huwag nating hintayin na bumagsak po ang healthcare system natin (Although, it has been reported that the occupancy rate of those allocated for COVID-19 beds is still at low risk, but let's not be confident. Let's not wait for our healthcare system to collapse),” said Go.
 
“Tulad noon na nabigla tayo. Importante muna makamtan natin ang herd immunity… dahil hangga’t nandiyan si COVID-19, nandiyan talaga ang banta (It was like we were shocked. It's important that we achieve herd immunity first... because as long as COVID-19 is there, the threat is really there),” he stressed.

66,Cayetano vows to continue pushing for P10K ‘ayuda’ bill,Hannah Torregoza,"May 3, 2023 ","Senator Alan Peter Cayetano on Wednesday, May 3 renewed his vow to pursue the passage of the measure that seeks to provide P10,000 cash aid for each family. 
 
Cayetano insisted the government has sufficient funds to implement such program.
 
“We will continue to push for it. May pera, pero hindi priority ng gobyerno (There’s funding, but it’s not the government’s priority) to do it that way,” Cayetano said in a short Facebook live.
 
The senator made the assurance on the second anniversary of his “Sampung Libong Pag-asa” initiative on Tuesday, May 2. He filed Senate Bill No. 62 or the proposed Sampung Libong Pag-asa Law providing the same benefits.
 
While the bill is still awaiting deliberation at the committee level, Cayetano said the Department of Finance (DOF) itself has confirmed there is P200-billion in the national budget that can be used to implement the proposal.
 
However, Cayetano noted state economic managers prefer to scatter the budget among various social protection programs under different agencies, which he says is less efficient.
 
“Ang policy ng administrasyon is ilagay y’ung iba sa PhilHealth, sa AICS (Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situations) sa DSWD, sa DOLE, sa DA, sa iba’t ibang program (The administration’s policy is to put it under PhilHealth, AICS, DSWD, DOLE, DA and other programs),” he said.
 
“Ang mga negosyo nakabangon na, pero ang mga indibidwal hindi pa. So kung papipilahin mo pa sila sa DA, sa DSWD, et cetera, makakakuha naman pero hirap pa at hindi lahat (businesses have recovered, but individual persons haven’t. So if you have to tell these people to line up at the DA, DSWD, etc. they can avail of it, but not all of them will),” he continued.
 
While pushing for the passage of the bill, Cayetano said he will continue his initiative in which he distributes P10,000 in cash each to chosen beneficiaries from across the country.

67,"Scattered rains, thunderstorms to persist over several parts of PH",Ellalyn De Vera-Ruiz,"May 3, 2023 ","Light to heavy rains and thunderstorms will continue to affect several parts of the country due to the low pressure area (LPA) and intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said on Wednesday, May 3.
PAGASA last located the LPA over the coastal waters of San Agustin, Surigao del Sur around 3 a.m. on Wednesday.
As a result of the combined effects of the LPA and ITCZ, scattered light to heavy rains and thunderstorms will persist over Oriental Mindoro, Occidental Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon, Palawan, Bicol Region, Visayas, and Mindanao.
PAGASA warned against possible flash floods or landslides in these areas, particularly during moderate to heavy rains.
Meanwhile, the easterlies, or warm air from the Pacific Ocean, will continue to bring hot and humid weather to the rest of the country.
Although warm weather persists, PAGASA said isolated rain showers or thunderstorms may affect some areas due to localized thunderstorms.
The public is advised to exercise caution as severe thunderstorms may also cause flash floods or landslides, especially in areas vulnerable to these hazards.

68,Tolentino: Possible deal with US nuclear firm will help address PH’s energy woes,Mario Casayuran,"May 3, 2023 ","The Philippine government’s potential deal with a US-based nuclear power firm would definitely help address its power crisis as the drought season continues to hound the country because of the El-Niño phenomenon, Senator Francis Tolentino said on Wednesday, May 3.
Tolentino issued the statement following Malacañang’s pronouncement that the Oregon-based NuScale Power Corp. is planning to conduct a study to pinpoint a site in the country.
“Palagay ko 'yong ganong makabagong planta na nagpo-provide ng nuclear energy na safe, modern, e malaking maitutulong, di ba? (I think a new nuclear power plant would provide a safe, modern… It will be a big help, right?),’’ he said.
“Hindi ito kasing laki nung Bataan e (It will not be as big as the Bataan nuclear power plant). May maliliit (There are small plants) Safe. Bago. Ito yung latest… and easily installable ang sabi (It is said that this is new, this is the latest and easily installable),” he added.
Tolentino emphasized that nuclear energy should always be an option, explaining that it is the “cleanest form of energy, thus far.”
According to Tolentino, it is only right for the national government to explore new ways in addressing the current energy shortage, with nuclear energy as one of the priorities through modern nuclear micro-reactors, rather than just relying on the current state of electric distribution—as the province of Mindoro Occidental and the entire Panay Island are currently experiencing daily power outages.
He also cited the recent power outage in Mindoro Occidental which had only four hours of power supply. This was solved last week.
The problem of power outages has shifted to Panay.
“Tapos noong sa Bacolod, biglaang ganon din ang nangyari (Then it shifted to Bacolod) Nandoon ako e, nakita ko yon, naramdaman ko 'yong sa Bacolod ilang oras iyon (I was there, I saw it, I felt it. It lasted for a few hours). Kung kailan gabi, mainit, brownout (When it is night, it is hot, there is a brownout),” he said.

“Since things are so volatile the stability would come from those alliances, those partnerships. And it is a strange thing to come from that  situation where you have very polarized world view, to come from that situation where now we have to look into very different directions all the time,” he added.
With this, he stressed that the trade relations between the Philippines and the United States must be “continually revisited"" in order for both parties to mutually benefit from these initiatives.
The President said he told US President Joe Biden that ""it’s very hard to categorize"" the partnership between the two countries as one thing as it does not only revolve on the area of defense.
""[I]in terms of trade, in terms of education, in terms of culture, in terms of people-to-people as it has come to be known, all of these things have been going on for a hundred years,” Marcos said.
“But it still needs to be continually revisited so as we can make the most of our friendship and our partnership. And so that is the world as I see it today and the reasons that will come,"" he added.
Marcos pointed out that his visit to Washington is vital especially during the “turbulent times” the relations between the Philippines and US went through in the past years.
“But similarly to our ambassadors' friendships, like two friendships,  you go to turbulent times when there are misunderstandings, when there are difficulties, when other forces prevail upon both sides of the partnership,” he said.
“But between the Philippines and the United states, we have prevailed through all that like a true friendship. And the reason for that I believe is that we truly have come to an understanding as to how we believe certain values and what is important, and our role in the world and that has never really been diminished,” the President added.
He reiterated that the mutual defense treaty between the two countries should evolve.
""It should evolve because the situation that we are surrounded with changes and we must evolve with that. Therefore it is extremely important that we have these interactions, it's extremely important that we are constant in communication. It is extremely important that we understand what it is we are trying to achieve,” he noted.
During a bilateral meeting, US President Joe Biden affirmed its ironclad alliance to the Philippines.

75,France opposes actions that increase tension in SCS,Joseph Pedrajas,"May 2, 2023 ","France has said it is opposing any action in the South China Sea that will escalate tension in the volatile Indo-Pacific region.
The French Embassy in Manila issued the statement on Tuesday, warning that it is following the recent events in the highly-contested waterway “with the utmost attention” after China’s yet another dangerous maneuver against the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG).
Recalling its commitment to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, France said respect for international law, particularly the freedom of navigation, is one of its “priorities for action.”
“We are opposed to any action that increases tensions and jeopardizes regional stability and the international order based on the rule of law,” it said.
On April 23, a near collision incident between Chinese and Philippine vessels occurred when China’s coast guard tried to block the path of its Filipino counterpart in the Ayungin Shoal, a part of the Philippine territory.
The incident raised yet another concern of other countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, as it was not the only time that China conducted such action against Filipinos in Philippine waters.

76,"AI to render 'many jobs obsolete', Salceda warns; here's what should be done",Ellson Quismorio,"May 2, 2023 ","A lot of jobs will be rendered ""obsolete"" by artificial intelligence (AI) if the concerned industries don't get the benefit of “strong, immediate, and responsive” protections with the law.
Albay 2nd district Rep. Joey Salceda gave this warning following the release of an article by the New York Times about the dangers of AI, as articulated in the thoughts of scientist Geoffrey Hinton. Hinton worked on AI for more than 25 years.
“The labor displacement issue is very valid. It will definitely make many jobs obsolete. Quick copywriting would be one of the first to fall. Videos made by AI are also emerging, and soon enough, they will be close to real,"" Salceda said in a statement Tuesday, May 2.
“But you will notice that AI ultimately relies on source material as basis for the ‘art’ it generates. So, theoretically, we should be able to take legal action on those who use AI-generated material if it infringes on original copyrighted material,"" pointed out the Bicolano.
“What AI appears to do right now is alter original content, but in essence, it still depends on original source material,"" underscored Salceda, pointing to a legal silver lining in the worrisome situation.
The economist-solon clarified that he wasn't against AI. ""Like any technology, it has goods and bads. We just have to respond in ways that protect our art and our artists.”
“With these AI-generated multimedia materials all over the internet, you do need a quick response mechanism. That’s why site blocking is as important as copyright protection. No enforcement, no ownership. You cannot own what you cannot protect. And you will not create if you cannot own,"" he explained.
Salceda is the principal author of House Bill (HB) No.7600, or the proposed Act strengthening the powers and functions of the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines, amending for the purpose Republic Act (RA) No. 8293, as amended, otherwise known as the “ Intellectual Property Code Of The Philippines"".
He says that the key feature of HB No.7600 is that “It allows the Intellectual Property Office to respond quickly to online infringement through a proper process of petitioning for the blocking of a website that contains infringed material.""
“I think we will approve it on the floor before the second SONA (State of the Nation Address) of PBBM (President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.). We have time,” said the chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means.
Salceda said he also wants the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) to develop a protocol “for doing site blocking if it is posted on a microsite or a social media account, since, of course, you can’t block the whole site in such cases"".
“We will continue to engage the IPOPHIL and the Department of Information and Communication Technology (DICT to see how we can operationalize these new powers,"" he said.

77,"Visayas, Mindanao, parts of Luzon to continue to have rains due to LPA, ITCZ",Ellalyn De Vera-Ruiz,"May 2, 2023 ","Several parts of the country will continue to experience scattered rain showers and thunderstorms due to the low pressure area (LPA) embedded along the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said on Tuesday afternoon, May 2.
PAGASA last located the LPA 210 kilometers east-southeast of Hinatuan, Surigao del Sur around 3 p.m. on Tuesday.
Romblon, Bicol Region, Visayas, and Mindanao will experience scattered rain showers and thunderstorms as a result of the combined effects of the LPA and ITCZ.
PAGASA warned against possible flash floods or landslides during moderate to heavy rains in these areas.
Meanwhile, the easterlies, or warm air from the Pacific Ocean, will continue to bring hot and humid weather to the rest of the country.
Although warm weather persists, PAGASA said isolated rain showers or thunderstorms may affect some areas due to localized thunderstorms.

The public is advised to exercise caution as severe thunderstorms may also cause flash floods or landslides, especially in areas vulnerable to these hazards.

78,"US presidential trade mission to create more jobs for Pinoys, says Romualdez",Ellson Quismorio,"May 2, 2023 ","More jobs for Filipinos will be generated via the historic presidential trade and investment mission ordered by United States (US) President Joe Biden to the Philippines.
House Speaker Martin Romualdez gave this forecast following Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.'s meeting with Biden Tuesday, May 2 at the White House in Washington DC.
“We have found a wellspring of new hope for the Filipino people as President Biden and President Marcos Jr. discuss plans for a brighter future together. With a first-ever presidential trade and investment mission on the horizon, the Philippines can expect job creation and economic growth,” said Romualdez, who personally witnessed the meeting between the two leaders.
“It is a promising partnership for progress and prosperity. What will follow is renewed confidence in the Philippines when it comes to investments, not only from the US but from the rest of the world as well. This is a powerful message, seeing the two leaders discuss prosperity for our people,” he added.
The Leyte 1st district congressman further said: ""[Amid] the positive outcome of the meeting between President Biden and President Marcos, the Philippine government expresses its eagerness for the upcoming job creation opportunities and looks forward to a continuous and fruitful partnership with the [US].”
“The prospect of a presidential trade and investment mission fills the nation with hope and optimism for a brighter future,"" the optimistic Romualdez said.
As for the House of Representatives, Romualdez said they will do everything to pass legislation that will allow and encourage the free facilitation of the trade investments that will result from the US presidential trade mission.
“This is our mandate and promise to the Filipino people: we will make sure that whatever investments we shall obtain from this mission shall find fertile ground in our economy. We will ensure that these will benefit millions of Filipino citizens,” he said.
The Speaker, who had been in the US since mid-April, laid the groundwork for Marcos' official visit there through a series of meetings and engagements with his counterparts in the country, as well as with private business leaders.

79,Farmers to PH gov’t: Support organic farming,Charie Mae F. Abarca,"May 2, 2023 ","A farmer-led organization on Tuesday, May 2, called on the national government to protect the rights of small-scale farmers and support organic farming.
“We call on the national government and the local government units (LGU) to listen to the small farmers and support organic farming,” said Magsasaka at Siyentipiko Para sa Pag-Unlad ng Agrikultura (MASIPAG) Visayas Regional Management Team Chair Rodolfo Cortez on Tuesday.
The peasant group stressed that government support is essential for the entire country to find a ""more sustainable way"" of achieving safe and affordable food for all Filipinos.
Along with its calls to support organic farming, the organization welcomed the Supreme Court’s issuance of writ of Kalikasan, halting the commercial release of genetically modified rice and eggplant products.
MASIPAG, along with other peasant organizations and advocates, previously stated that genetically modified crops pose threat not only to consumers’ health but also to the environment.
“[W]e strongly believe that [genetically modified] rice or golden rice and Bt eggplant will not benefit us, and will do more harm than good,” Cortez furthered.
In relation to its calls regarding organic farming, MASIPAG urged the national government and all local government units (LGUs) across the archipelago to grant the passage of an ordinance that will prevent the entry of genetically modified crops, saying that this would protect the farmers’ and consumers’ right to healthy and safe food.

80,"DOH expects 390,000 doses of Covid-19 bivalent vaccines by the end of May",Dhel Nazario,"May 2, 2023 ","The Department of Health (DOH) said on Tuesday, May 2, that the country may receive a donation of 390,000 doses of Covid-19 bivalent vaccines by the end of the month.
In a media briefing, DOH Officer-in-Charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said that it has begun with the process and has already secured an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and other necessary requirements from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
""Hopefully by the end of May, we can be able to receive these 390,000 doses,"" she disclosed.
Currently, Vergeire said that the agency is just finalizing the essential documents. Covid-19 bivalent vaccines were designed to specifically target the Omicron variant and its subvariants.
Meanwhile, she explained that one of the hurdles that prevented the country from receiving the Covid-19 bivalent vaccines stemmed from a legal aspect since there was a requirement coming from the manufacturer itself which was to sign an indemnification clause and the immunity from liability.
But she mentioned that a discussion occurred between the DOH and the government of the country who will be donating the vaccines.
""Sila ay pumayag naman at nahikayat yung manufacturer na pumayag na na we are not going to have this immunity, parang general kasi yung statement na parang we are giving up our sovereign rights. Nabago yung clause and therefore nakapag-proceed tayo (They [government] agreed and the manufacturer was persuaded to allow us not to have this immunity, there was this general statement that we are giving up our sovereign rights. The clause was changed and we were able to proceed),"" she said.
On the other hand, Vergeire also disclosed that there are still no final agreements with the Covax Facility and that the first batch which was supposed to be delivered to the country was given in the meantime, to another country instead.
""But they have commited that once we are ready with our basis legally ay maari naman tayong mabigyan pa rin,"" she added.

81,"Lapid, Tolentino OK with revival of mandatory face mask policy",Hannah Torregoza,"May 2, 2023 ","Two senators have expressed support to President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s plan to bring back the mandatory use of face mask amid the recent rise of Covid-19 cases in the country.


Senator Manuel “Lito” Lapid said it is important for the government and the public to learn from its experience during the global Covid-19 pandemic. 


“Dapat hindi natin makalimutan ang mga natutuhan natin sa pandemya. Huwag na nating antayin na maulit ang pinakamalalang bahagi nito (We should not forget what we learned during the pandemic. Let’s not wait for the worst things to happen),” Lapid said in a statement.


“Hinihikayat ko ang ating mga kababayan na sumunod pa rin sa health protocol ng gobyerno para labanan ang muling pagkalat ng COVID (I appeal to our people to still follow state health protocols to fight the spread of Covid),” he said.


Sen. Francis Tolentino also welcomed the plan saying the latest Covid variant, the XBB.1.16 or Arcturus, is another serious concern. 


The new variant, he noted, is characterized by conjunctivitis or sore eyes and is usually referred to as “pink eye.” The disease is caused by allergens, bacteria or viruses.


“Okay lang iyon kasi yung Arcturus, remember that name that’s the new variant, that variant na iyon kasama (includes) sore eyes,” Tolentino said during a press briefing. 


“So akala niyo may sore eyes kayo, hawak sa kamay, hawak sa mata akala niyo sore eyes, iyon na pala yung symptom (So you think you have sore eyes, you hold your hand, you put it on your eyes, and you think its sore eyes. It’s already a symptom),” he said.


“So yung iba nga ang sabi pati pag hawak sa mata iwasan, diba? So ingat kayo pag nag o-outing outing, swimming kasi yung sore eyes, diba? May sore eyes pag nag swimming hindi mo alam pag may sore eyes yung, diba (The others say they should stop touching the eyes. So let’s be careful when going on an outing, or swimming),” Tolentino advised.

83,Cardinal Advincula cites virtues of patron of firemen,Christina Hermoso,"May 2, 2023 ","Manila Archbishop Jose Cardinal Advincula cited the virtues of Saint Florian, the patron saint of firemen, as he encouraged members of the Bureau of Fire Protection to take inspiration from the saint.
      “St. Florian was a Christian, a disciple of Christ. He refused to follow the order of the Emperor Diocletian to slaughter the Christians in his area. Because of this, he was sentenced to death by burning. He challenged his executioners to go and light the fire saying: ‘If you do, I will climb to Heaven on the flames.’ St. Florian was drowned instead, thrown into the river with a rock tied around his neck. St. Florian is a model of rigor and conviction. He is ready to lay down his life for the truth and what is right,” Cardinal Advincula said when he presided during a novena mass for St. Florian at the BFPNational Headquarters in Quezon City with its chaplain Fr. Raymond T. Tapia.
  The Catholic Church is set to observe the feast day of St. Florian, the patron saint of firemen on Thursday, May 4.
   “His selfless virtues and qualities are also needed in your work as firemen. When duty calls, you’re not afraid of the risks involved. What motivates you is the altruistic desire to rescue and to save lives and properties. May St. Florian give you the gift to fulfill your mission orders,” His Eminence said.
   Cardinal Advincula cited St. Florian’s dedication to his work.
   “It is said that St. Florian was asked to put out a massive fire with only one bucket of water, sparing a village from destruction. This may not be realistic in your situation today, but what this really tells us is that we can be instruments for the good no matter how inadequate we are,” he said.
   The Church leader expressed his gratitude and admiration to the men and women of the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) for the “great service to our communities, for protecting us and being ready all the time to respond to any emergency.”
   “I would like to honor your commitment and courage. Being a firefighter is not just a job or a career, it is a calling, a mission that asks you to go beyond your self-interest,” he said.
   St. Florian (250-304 AD) was an imperial army commander who was martyred around the 3rd century AD when he defied the Diocletianic Prosecution of Christians in the then Roman province of Noricum in Austria.

84,"PAF, USAF jets take over PH skies for ‘Cope Thunder’",Martin Sadongdong,"May 2, 2023 ","Fighter and advanced trainer jets from the Philippine Air Force (PAF) and United States Air Force (USAF) have dominated the country’s skies for the launch of the Cope Thunder Philippines Exercise (CT Ph) 23-1 on Monday, May 1.
 

(FA-50 PH / File photo courtesy of Philippine Air Force)
Col. Ma. Consuelo Castillo, PAF spokesperson, said that the exercise involves F-16 fighter aircraft from the USAF and FA-50 advanced jet trainers and light combat aircraft from PAF.
Around 160 USAF service members and 400 PAF airmen have joined the drills which took place several days after the conclusion of the biggest iteration of the Exercise Balikatan.
“The exercise aims to provide an opportunity for PAF and PACAF [US Pacific Air Forces] to enhance their capabilities and readiness to respond to potential threats in the region,” Castillo said on Tuesday, May 2.
The primary flight operations for the first phase of Cope Thunder from May 1 to 12 are currently being held at the Clark Air Base in Pampanga.
Castillo said that a key component of the exercise is the mission planning cell (MPC) which is responsible for coordinating the integration of different aircraft, as well as executing defensive counter air (DCA) and offensive counter air (OCA) operations.
“The first week will focus on DCA operations. These involve the identification, tracking, and interception of enemy aircraft in the vicinity of friendly forces,” she stated.
The PAF spokesperson explained that subject matter expert exchanges (SMEEs) on maintenance and security forces will be conducted to support DCA operations and provide participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to maintain their equipment and ensure security in the operational field.
Meanwhile, the second phase from July 2 to 21 will focus on OCA operations involving offensive attacks on enemy aircraft and ground targets.
The CT-Ph23-1 marks the revival of the bilateral exercise between the two Air Forces after more than three decades.
The original Cope Thunder exercises were first held in 1976 and continued annually in the Philippines until 1990 to provid regular flight training for US pilots and allied nations.

85,Increase in Covid-19 cases far from figures during pandemic's height - DOH,Dhel Nazario,"May 2, 2023 ","Despite the slight increase in Covid-19 cases, the Department of Health (DOH) said on Tuesday, May 2, that it's not the same as numbers recorded during the height of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021.
In a media briefing, DOH Officer-in-Charge Maria Rosario Vergeire explained that the increase in Covid-19 cases being observed does not translate to increased hospital admissions; severe and critical cases; and deaths.
The country's healthcare utilization rate remains at low risk. According to Vergeire, this is due to the reinforced wall of immunity from vaccination.
She pointed out that the increase in cases is due to a multitude of factors. One of which that she mentioned is the virus' mutation, producing subvariants such as the Omicron subvariant XBB.1.16 or Arcturus. She also cited the public's behavior and mobility such as summer excursions which lead to continuous interactions that allow an increased likelihood of transmitting the disease. Lastly, she added that the practice of getting tested when feeling symptoms contributes to the increase in the positivity rate.
""Now, do we see this number of cases continuing to increase in this next month or so at kailan siya bababa? It will all depend on our behavior,"" she explained.
Based on current projections, Vergeire stated that the country will continue to experience an increase in Covid-19 cases until June up to 600 cases, and after that, she said that DOH hopes that cases will start to decrease.
Meanwhile, she also stated that there is a need for the country to advance the level of its risk tolerance from Covid-19.
In terms of vaccination, Vergeire reported that as of March 20, at least 78.4 million individuals, or 100.44 percent have been fully vaccinated while or 23.8 million or 30. 49 percent have received their first booster shots and 4.4 million have acquired a second booster shot.

“Good lawyers must know that there truly are heavenly proportions to the toil that we do on this side of life, and in so knowing are moved to submit to Him every outcome, even as we must presently apply ourselves to approximating, albeit faintly, what peace and justice on the other side of eternity can look like in the here and now,” he also said.
In his speech, incoming chairperson Justice Ramon Paul L. Hernando of the 2023 Bar exams – also online and regionalized – gave three reminders to the new lawyers – “aim to be a lawyer of good repute throughout your professional life, keep your feet on the ground, and excel responsibly.”
With the recently approved CPRA, Justice Hernando encouraged them to use social media responsibly and to work gratis or pro bono “at least 1,000 times” in their professional lifetime.

89,"PH airspace to be shut down on May 3, 17 for repair of air traffic system – CAAP",Martin Sadongdong,"May 2, 2023 ","The entire Philippine airspace will be shut down for several hours on May 3 and 17 as necessary repairs and upgrades will be conducted by the government to fix the issues hounding the country’s air traffic management system (ATMS), the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) announced.
(File photo via Manila Bulletin
In a statement Tuesday, May 2, the CAAP said that a corrective maintenance activity will be carried out at the Philippine Air Traffic Management Center (ATMC) which will result to the suspension of its operations from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. on May 3; and from 12 midnight to 6 a.m. on May 17.
“However, if the activity is finished earlier, the issued Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) will be lifted, and operations at the ATMC will resume as normal,” the CAAP said.
The ATMC is a facility which houses the Communications, Navigations, Surveillance / Air Traffic Management System (CNS/ATMS) that manages and supervises the air traffic activities within the Philippine Flight Information Region (FIR).
“The corrective maintenance activity is necessary to repair the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR), replace the Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS), and upgrade the Air Traffic Management System (ATMS) A/B power supply,” the CAAP said.
The AVR refers to an electronic device which functions as a protection against surges as it regulates the voltage delivered to devices. The UPS, on the other hand, ensures that an equipment has a backup power supply in case of power failure.
The ATMS repair and upgrade will enable the UPS and AVR to serve as “each other’s backup in case the other power supply encounters a problem,” the CAAP noted.
The CAAP said that the corrective maintenance activity will affect flights at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), Clark International Airport (CRK), and Mactan-Cebu International Airport (MCIA), and several flights at the other 42 CAAP commercially-operated airports.
“The CAAP has already coordinated with and advised concerned stakeholders such as air carriers and airport operators Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA), Luzon International Premiere Airport Development Corp. (LIPAD), and GMR–Megawide Cebu Airport Corporation (GMCAC) in advance regarding the intended corrective maintenance activity,” the CAAP said.
“Mitigating measures and flight schedule adjustments have been discussed with stakeholders to ensure the smooth conduct of the imperative maintenance activity,” it added.
It can be recalled that the Philippine airspace was shut down on New Year’s Day, January 1, when the ATMC was hit by a power outage due to the malfunctioning of its equipment. The incident affected nearly 300 flights and around 65,000 passengers. 
This was followed by a power outage at NAIA Terminal 3 on Labor Day, May 1, from 1:05 a.m. to 8:46 a.m. which affected around 50 flights and 9,000 passengers.
The CAAP assured the public that operations at the ATMC will resume as normal once the maintenance activity is completed.
“We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding and cooperation in ensuring the safety and efficiency of our air traffic management system,” it said.

91,"No need for return of face mask mandate, DOH says",Dhel Nazario,"May 2, 2023 ","There is no need to bring back the face mask mandate.
This was the recommendation of the Department of Health (DOH) to the Office of the President based on the agreement from their discussions with the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID).
In a press conference on Tuesday, May 2, DOH Officer-in-Charge Maria Rosario Vergeire stressed that there is a need to shift the public's mindset. She explained that cases will increase and decrease since Covid-19 remains present and throughout its life cycle, will mutate and produce subvariants occasionally.
Vergeire clarified, however, that this does not mean that the health agency opposes masking and mentioned that they will always encourage it yet she stated that every individual must know how to protect his or herself and their family.
""Piliin natin na magmask tayo kapag pupunta tayo sa mga high risk na mga lugar katulad po ng matataong lugar and closed spaces na pangit ang ventilation lalong-lalo na kung hindi kayo bakunado. Kung kayo po ay nakakatanda o may comorbidity o di kaya kayo po ay immunocompromised o buntis, pillin po natin na magmask (We can choose to wear masks when we're going to high risk areas like crowded places and closed spaces with poor ventilation especially if you're not vaccinated. If you are older or with comorbodities or if you're immunocompromised or pregnant, choose to wear a face mask),"" she said.
What the DOH is pointing out, according to Vergeire, is not the value of masking per se but instead how to manage it and how the country will move forward from its current Covid-19 situation.
She also added that the national government cannot afford to implement ""back-and-forth"" policies since doing so will affect the other sectors of society.
""We cannot have that low tolerance na kapag tumataas ang kaso bigla tayong major reaction ibalik natin iyang pagmamask, mag lock down tayo uli. We cannot do this back and forth policies because we have to balance this with our economy,"" she said.
""Diyan sa ekonomiyang pinaguusapan natin andami nang nagugutom natin na kababayan which also affects our health, kaya lahat yan binabalanse (In the aspect of the economy, a lot of citizens are driven to starvation which also affects the health, so we have to balance things out),"" she added.
Vergeire said that they arrived at the recommendation even before President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.'s pronouncement he sees no need for a face mask mandate but instead a focus on vaccination among younger individuals.

92,'Anti-God': Bro Eddie wants to probe inclusion of LGBTQ-related topics in DepEd's draft curriculum,Ellson Quismorio,"May 2, 2023 ","An evangelist-turned-congessman is up in arms over what he called the ""inclusion and promotion"" of LGBTQ-related topics such as gender fluidity, same-sex union and same-sex marriage in the Department of Education's (DepEd) draft curriculum for Kindergarten to Grade 10.
“We are shocked to discover that the promotion of gender ideology, same sex union and same-sex marriage is slowly creeping under our nose into the very curriculum of our basic education!"" CIBAC Party-List Rep. Bro. Eddie Villanueva said in a statement Tuesday, May 2.
""What is more worrying is the slant towards promoting and condoning such practices in the minds of our young students!” noted Villanueva, who vowed to call for a congressional investigation on the matter.
DepEd has released its draft revised curriculum for Kindergarten to Grade 10 through its FaceBook page and it has asked the public and interested stakeholders to review it and provide feedback. As per the announcement, the review is open until May 3, 2023.
LGBTQ stands for, and represents, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community.

“Not only is this anti-God, but also clearly unconstitutional! Section 13, Article II of the Constitution mandates that the State shall promote the moral and spiritual well-being of our youth. I do not see that the introduction of these topics into our basic education curriculum is heading the right direction,” added the CIBAC solon.
In the proposed new curriculum under the subject Araling Panlipunan 10, among the topics included to be taught to the children are the different genders and the meaning and benefits of same-sex unions.
“Though this is still a draft and, hopefully, will still undergo revisions, it is just very disturbing that there are proponents of gender ideology inside DepEd that inject this advocacy to the education of our youth.
""I am calling all stakeholders to be more vigilant on this issue because this a primordial concern that will shape the moral fiber of our youth,” Villanueva said.

93,Villar pushes creation of special courts on anti-agricultural smuggling,Mario Casayuran,"May 2, 2023 ","
Senator Cynthia A. Villar is pushing for the creation of special courts to try exclusively smuggling cases worth billions of pesos that has prejudiced farmers and the economy.
Villar said regional trial courts (RTCs) have not been effective.
In today’s  hybrid public  hearing  of  the  Senate Committee on Justice  and  Human  Rights;  and  the  committees on agriculture,  food,  and agrarian reform; and finance on Senate Bill No. 1963 which she authored, Villar expressed her belief that the Anti-Agricultural Smuggling Act would be implemented effectively if there is a court dedicated to smuggling, hoarding, profiteering and cartel of agricultural products.
Villar pointed out that even with the existence of law against agricultural smuggling, there have been no smugglers charged with economic sabotage.
In a statement she reading before the start of the hybrid hearing, Villar said that  In 2016, Congress passed RA 10817 “ The Agri Smuggling Act” which she authored.
“The cut of amount to be declared as economic sabotage and non-bailable if P10 million  for rice and P1 million for other agri-products. I read in the papers of smuggling of more than cut off amount and yet no smugglers was charged with economic sabotage. In addition, during the onion crisis, the production cost of onion is at maximum of P25/kg and yet being sold at P600-P700/kg,’’ she said.
“There is really hoarding, price manipulation and cartel. We are amending the Anti- smuggling Act to give more teeth to it and to include hoarding, price manipulation and cartel as economic sabotage and non-bailable. We intend also to create an Anti-Smuggling Court to ensure the proper implementation of the law,’’ she added.
Senator Francis “Tol” Tolentino, chairperson of the Senate justice committee, said Villar filed Senate Bill 1963 to address the seemingly uncontrollable spike of prices brought about by the “smuggling” of agricultural products.
Despite Republic Act No. 10845, known as the Anti-Agricultural Smuggling Act of 2016, Tolentino said smuggling of agricultural products continue to proliferate in the Philippines.
The main purpose of the Anti-Agricultural Smuggling Court is to try cases involving smuggling, hoarding, profiteering and cartel of agricultural products and to ensure that individuals and organizations involved in these activities are held accountable for their actions.
Supreme Court Justice Raul Villanueva said the High Tribunal is leaving to the Senate the creation of special courts.
A member of the Philippine Judges Association suggested that the proposed special court should be attached as the fourth branch of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA).
Jesus Carranza, head of the Federation of Filipino industries, supported the Villar bill, adding that the Philippines has been losing P250 billion in value added tax  (VAT) through smuggling.
Most of the successful smuggling operations happened at the ports and very small percentage are seized at warehouses, he said.
Before, there were some 1.5 million spindles used by the textile industry. Now, there are only 110,000, he added.
Arranza recommended that anybody prejudiced by the smuggling operations should be allowed to file charges as a majority of the cases filed were dismissed by the Department of Justice.
The reason, according to Arranza, is that documents at the Bureau of Customs get lost.
He also said that substandard products are smuggled to the detriment of the construction industry.
Jayson Cainglet, Sinag executive director,  lamented that there were 300 cases of smuggling filed but so far no conviction has been recorded.
‘’Kaya  tuloy-tuloy (that’s why smuggling continues),’’ he added.
When customs officials testified that not one has been convicted, Tolentino said he and Villar has no one to visit at the country’s jail.
Tolentino, also chairman of the Senate Blue Ribbon committee, strongly suggested that licenses  of businessmen should be cancelled by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when their shipments are seized.
Villar said thus accused before the Anti-Agricultural  Smuggling  Courts should not be allowed to post bill.
Since those accused are rich and can afford to post bill, their stay at detention centers during the pendency of the case is punishment enough.
They can spend their money to fix their cases ‘’and they don’t care about money,’’ she added.
Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III asks the committees to review the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of Republic Act 10845, known as the Anti-Agricultural Smuggling Act of 2016.
In today’s hybrid hearing, Pimentel suggested to the committee to look closely and review RA 10845 to determine how a simple law was made difficult to enforce because of a faulty IRR.
“Maybe we can add a specific crime to the law like 'refusal to prosecute large scale agricultural smuggling' which will make liable the legal department (of the Bureau of Customs) and even the Department of Justice prosecutors, depending on the evidence,” Pimentel said
“This is similar to obstruction of justice but very specific. In my opinion, this will be additional teeth to the law,” he added.
Pimentel also wanted to amend section 3 of RA 10845 by rewriting the phrase “as valued by the Bureau of Customs” and involve the Department of Agriculture in valuating smuggled agricultural products in order to put flexibility to the law.

94,Sandigan denies ex-QC mayor Bautista’s plea to dismiss graft charge,Czarina Nicole Ong Ki,"May 2, 2023 ","The Sandiganbayan has denied the plea of former Quezon City mayor Herbert “Bistek” M. Bautista to dismiss the graft charge filed against him for alleged violation of his right to speedy disposition of cases.
With the denial, the anti-graft court set Bautista’s arraignment and pre-trial of his case on May 18 starting at 8:30 a.m.
Bautista and former city administrator Aldrin C. Cuña were charged with graft in the payment of over P32.1 million to Geodata Solutions, Inc. for the procurement of occupational permitting and tracking system.
The prosecution alleged that the procurement was not covered by an ordinance and there was no complete delivery.
Bautista filed an urgent motion and told the anti-graft court that entering into a contract with Geodata did not automatically mean he acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence.
He also told the court that his constitutional right to speedy disposition of case has been violated by the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB). He asserted that while the complaint against him was filed on Dec. 13, 2019, it took more than more than three years for the OMB to conclude the preliminary investigation. The graft charge against him was filed only on March 15, 2023.
However, the Sandiganbayan ruled that the OMB did not cause any inordinate delay in handling his case.
""Given the entirety of the events surrounding the preliminary investigation carried out by the Ombudsman and considering that the accused only faults the prosecution based solely on its mathematical computation of time lapsed, the delay attributable to the preliminary investigation does not appear to be unreasonable,"" the court said.
""To stress, the concept of speedy disposition is relative. Absent any vexatious, capricious or oppressive delays, and without any unjustified postponements of proceedings during preliminary investigation, it is unwarranted to conclude that the accused's constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases was infringed,"" it added.
The resolution was written by Seventh Division Chairperson Ma. Theresa Dolores C. Gomez-Estoesta with the concurrence of Associate Justices Zaldy V. Trespeses and Georgina D. Hidalgo.
Bautista and Cuña are also facing a separate graft charge before the court’s third division on alleged payment of more than P25.3 million to Cygnet Energy and Power Asia Inc.
The prosecution alleged that Bautista and Cuña made the full payment to Cygnet for the supply and installation of Solar Power System and Waterproofing Works for the Civic Center Building.
However, the prosecution alleged that Cygnet was not entitled to the payment due to its reported failure to get the Net Metering System from Meralco, which is a requirement of the Supply and Delivery Agreement.

95,"UK, Canada stand behind PH in South China Sea dispute",Raymund Antonio,"May 2, 2023 ","The United Kingdom (UK) and Canada have expressed concern over the supposed “dangerous conduct” against Philippine vessels in the South China Sea.
On Twitter, British Ambassador to the Philippines Laure Beaufils called out the dangerous actions toward Filipino vessels.
“The UK is concerned by continued reports of dangerous conduct towards Filipino vessels in the South China Sea,” she said in a May 1 post.
The envoy added that the UK remains committed to international law, particularly the United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in the South China Sea.
She issued the statement after a China Coast Guard (CCG) ship cut off Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessel BRP Malapascua on April 23 at the Ayungin Shoal, which is within Manila’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
This maritime incident at the shoal in the Spratly Islands caused a near-collision between China and Philippine coast guard vessels.
According to the PCG, it had spotted more than 100 Chinese vessels, including a warship and coast guard ships, during its maritime patrols in the West Philippine Sea from April 18 to 24.
In a separate post, Ambassador David Hartman also reiterated Canada’s call for “upholding the rules-based international order” in the contested waters.
“We are troubled by dangerous and unprofessional conduct in this region and unreservedly support the government of the Philippines in enforcing its sovereign rights within its EEZ,” his post read.
The Canadian ambassador said that “peace and stability” in the South China Sea are “essential to the interests” of the international community.
UK and Canada were the latest countries to express concern over the current situation in the disputed waters after Australia and United States.
But unlike the US, the three did not name China over its aggression and intrusion in Manila’s territorial waters in the South China Sea.

96,"Make good governance 'viral' in bureaucracy, Cong Yamsuan tells GCG",Ellson Quismorio,"May 2, 2023 ","Bicol Saro Party-list Rep. Brian Yamsuan has challenged the Governance Commission for Government-Owned and -Controlled Corporations (GCG) to take the lead in promoting good governance in the bureaucracy.
This was the gist of Yamsuan's message to GCG officials and employees during their flag-raising ceremony Tuesday, May 2.
He said the GCG’s mantra of aiming G.R.E.A.T., which stands for Good Governance, Rightsizing, Efficiency, Accountability and Transparency, “should go viral” across the bureaucracy so that government employees can be inspired to do better in performing their duties and responsibilities as public servants.
The GCG’s “young, vibrant and energetic” employees can lead the way in undertaking this mission, Yamsuan said.
“Commit to be G.R.E.A.T.—greater and better, not only for yourself, but for the Filipino people,” he added.
“Hindi lang ito trabaho, commitment ito. Commitment ninyo ito sa inyong sarili at sa taumbayan (This isn't just a job, but a commitment. This is your commitment to yourself and the people),” added the neophyte solon, who was invited by GCG Chairperson Justice (ret.) Alex Quiroz to deliver an inspirational message during the event.
Yamsuan said every government employee should do his or her part in promoting good governance to maintain, and even heighten, the public’s trust and respect in Government.
He said the  GCG’s job of overseeing and monitoring the operations of about 118 Government-Owned and -Controlled Corporations (GOCCs) is no easy task.
But under Quiroz's guidance and leadership, Yamsuan expressed confidence that the men and women of GCG will continue to remain committed to being responsible, responsive and productive public servants.
Quiroz and GCG Commissioner Gideon Mortel  presented Yamsuan with a certificate of appreciation following his inspirational remarks.

97,PAGASA raises El Niño Alert,Ellalyn De Vera-Ruiz,"May 2, 2023 ","The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) has raised the possibility of El Niño developing in the coming months from “watch” to “alert,” the second to last stage of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Alert and Warning System.
“Recent conditions and model forecasts indicate that El Niño may emerge in the coming season, June-July-August, at 80 percent probability and may persist until the first quarter of 2024,” PAGASA said in an advisory released on Tuesday, May 2.
“With this development, the PAGASA El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Alert and Warning System is now raised to El Niño Alert,” it added.

The El Niño Watch has been in effect since March 23, before PAGASA changed the monitoring status to El Niño Alert.
“When conditions are favorable for the development of El Niño within the next two months at a probability of 70 percent or more, an El Niño alert is issued,” PAGASA explained.
The next and final stage of the ENSO Alert System is activated when the climate phenomenon reaches “full-blown” El Niño status. 
The El Niño or warm phase is characterized by unusually warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific.
According to PAGASA, El Niño raises the likelihood of below-average rainfall conditions, which might have adverse impact, such as drought and dry spells in several parts of the country.
However, PAGASA pointed out the probability of above-average rainfall conditions over the western portion of the country during the southwest monsoon, also known as “habagat” season.
“All concerned government agencies and the general public are encouraged to keep on monitoring and take precautionary measures against the impending impacts of El Niño,” it said.

98,"CHR supports DepEd’s blended, alternative learning modes to protect students",Czarina Nicole Ong Ki,"May 2, 2023 ","The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) has expressed full support to the Department of Education (DepEd) which gave schools the option to apply blended and alternative delivery modes (ADM) of learning to protect students from natural disasters and extreme climate conditions.
It cited DepEd’s Order No. 037 -- the Guidelines on the Cancellation or Suspension of Classes and Work in Schools in the Event of Natural Disasters, Power Outages/Power Interruptions, and Other Calamities -- issued last April 26 which emphasized to school heads and directors that extremely high temperatures fall within the parameters of immediately canceling classes or transitioning to ADM.
It expressed full support as it cited a study conducted by the International Labor Organization in 2019 that extreme temperatures due to climate change have become a safety hazard for those living in climate change-vulnerable countries.
It noted that DepEd has already endorsed the return to face-to-face classes for both public and private schools, with it being optional for private schools, since there are educational and socio-emotional benefits when children have direct interactions with fellow students and their teachers.
But given the extreme heat being experienced all throughout the country this summer, DepEd took action and gave schools the option to apply blended and ADM of learning, it said.
The CHR said that DepEd displayed ""commendable responsiveness and adaptiveness"" especially after there were reports of students who experienced heat-related health issues.
There was even a case in Laguna during the last week of March when dozens of students fainted due to heat exhaustion as they stayed outdoors for their school’s fire and earthquake drills, it said.
""As the country’s independent national human rights institution, CHR supports DepEd’s decision to pursue blended and ADM learning to promote a safe learning environment for children pursuant to the Convention on the Rights of a Child, and a safe working environment for faculty and staff in line with international labor standards, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Convention of 1981,"" it also said.
""Further, CHR appreciates how DepEd left this decision at the discretion of school heads, acknowledging that each school may have different experiences and capacities in dealing with the dry season heat,"" it added.
However, the CHR reminded DepEd that there still are ""persisting gaps"" in the distance learning component of blended learning that should be addressed. Poor students are at a disadvantage when blended learning is applied since they do not have access to decent-performing gadgets, stable internet, and other resources, it said.
""Their home environments were barely conducive for attending online classes and accomplishing school work. And in working to make ends meet, their family members could not afford to supervise and provide supplementary guidance and lessons in remote learning setups,"" it noted.
The CHR called on DepEd and its development partners to strengthen their assistance and programs for low-income families and marginalized groups in order to prevent the widening of social inequalities.
In doing so, the CHR said DepEd can focus next on long-term solutions to the impacts of climate change.
Some teachers' organizations have already suggested the construction of climate-resilient classrooms and the improvement of classroom-learner and teacher-student ratios to create better learning and working environments for all people engaging in face-to-face learning sessions, it added.

99,"Pro-, anti-Marcos groups greet PBBM in US capitol",Betheena Unite,"May 2, 2023 ","WASHINGTON, D.C.— President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. had  a spirited meet-and-greet event with Filipinos here on Monday afternoon in which the attendees virtually mobbed him in their excitement to exchange plesantries with him.
As he stepped outside, however, the chilly weather was matched by the cold reception that he was given by a different group.
Protesters outside the venue voiced their opposition to the Philippine leader.
As the crowd from the ""meet and greet"" event headed out, they were met with resounding chants coupled with drum beats from rallyists criticizing the current administration.
Holding placards, megaphones, and a huge Philippine flag, activists yelled ""Marcos is not welcome here.""
Standing face to face just a few meters away from the rallyists, Marcos supporters retaliated by chanting ""BBM"" as they waved their mini Philippine flags.
The two groups  continued trading chants from there.

Rallyists also assembled in front of the White House as Marcos met with US President Joe Biden on the same day.
They were there to oppose the bilateral talks between the two leaders and Marcos' other engagements while in the US.
The activists alleged that the Marcos administration would ""sell out Philippine sovereignty in exchange for US aid, investments, and political legitimacy despite the brutal history of the Marcos family.""
They claimed that Marcos' meetings with Biden and other state officials ""will only put the Filipino people in more danger of poverty and war.""
They then called on Filipinos and supporters to ""join the people's movement to fight for the sovereign and democratic rights of the Filipino people.""

Tansingco further explained that secondary documents may be required from travelers if inconsistencies are found in the primary travel requirements such as passports, visas, and round trip tickets.
He warned traffickers that they face a maximum jail time of 40 years and are being monitored by local law enforcement agencies.

(M/V Dream Keeper / File photo via PCG)
A squall is a sudden violent gust of wind or a localized storm which usually lasts for a few seconds. But it was enough to sink M/Y Dream Keeper last Sunday, April 30, while carrying 32 individuals who were supposed to go diving and turn their dream vacation into a nightmare.
“Doon sa statement na nakalap sa nakaligtas, ang sinasabi nila ‘yung squall po o ‘yong sinasabi namin sa Tagalog na kanas kanas. Ito po ‘yong kundisyon ng karagatan na kahit walang storm surge, kahit walang sama ng panahon, biglang magbabago, didilim, lalakas ‘yong alon at ‘yong hangin, at may pag-ulan pa (Based on the statements that we gathered from the survivors, they were referring to a squall or what we call kanas kanas in Tagalog. This is a condition at sea where even in the absence of a storm surge, even without a bad weather, the weather will change, the sky will turn dark, the waves and wind will get stronger, and there will be rain),” explained Rear Adm. Armando Balilo, PCG spokesperson, in a radio interview with dzBB on Tuesday, May 2.
“Iyon daw ang nangyari sa kanila at ‘yon ang naging sanhi ng paglubog nila. Talagang napakalakas daw (That’s what happened to them and that’s what caused their sinking. They said it was really strong),” he added.
Search and rescue (SAR) operations were ongoing to find the four individuals who went missing when the incident happened. They were only identified as the Chinese owner of the dive yacht, and two tourists and a dive master who are all Filipinos.
The PCG has dispatched patrol ship BRP Melchora Aquino while the Philippine Navy (PN) fielded its own BRP Carlos Albert to support the ongoing SAR. Two aluminum boats of the Tubbataha National Park also joined the search.
Meanwhile, the 28 survivors were brought to Puerto Princesa City, Palawan by BRP Melchora Aquino on Monday, May 1.

The incident did not cause an oil spill although Balilo said that PCG personnel saw an oil sheen in the area where the yacht capsized.
“Noong isang araw nakakita kami ng oil sheen. Palatandaan ito ng manipis na langis pero ang pagkareport sa atin ay diesel. Pinapalagay natin sa mga sandaling ito ay wala na (The other day, we saw an oil sheen. This signals the presence of thin oil but it was reported to us that it was diesel.

106,Marcos asks NGCP: Solve Visayas power crisis ASAP,Joseph Pedrajas,"May 2, 2023 ","President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has called on the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) to immediately solve the power crisis in some parts of the Visayas.
The President also asked the corporation to regularly update concerned government officials about the status of the Visayas grid; build the Cebu-Negros-Panay backbone project; and expedite the signing of Ancillary Service Procurement Agreement (ASPA).
The order came amid the crisis in electricity in the islands of Panay, Guimaras and Negros.
According to the Presidential Communications Office (PCO), among Marcos’ demands was for the NGCP to be transparent, as well as, to continuously inform the local officials, distribution utilities, power generators, the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) about the Visayas’ grid status.
NGCP was also instructed to “synchronize the protection relays of transmission, generation and distribution in the next two weeks to prevent massive blackouts.”
The President told the corporation to immediately finish the third stage of the Cebu-Negros-Panay backbone project, which involves linking Negros and Cebu by laying an overhead line from Bacolod City to Carlos City, then to Toledo City through a submarine cable.
NGCP, the PCO said, was also instructed to review the reliability of each Visayas sub-grid and fast track the signing of ASPA to manage power fluctuations.
According to PCO, the islands’ provincial disaster risk reduction and management offices and the Provincial Civil Defense Cluster would convene on Tuesday, May 2, to act on the President’s instructions.

107,Villafuerte hopes proposed WPS joint patrols would make headway during Marcos' US visit,Ellson Quismorio,"May 2, 2023 ","Camarines Sur 2nd district Rep. LRay Villafuerte is optimistic that the Biden adminiatration would hasten discussions on the planned joint maritime patrols in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) during President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.'s ongoing visit to the United States (US).
Specifically, Villafuerte wants to see ""a final agreement on joint patrols not only with the US but with our other allies as well such as Japan and Australia”.
The Bicol solon, who sits as the National Unity Party (NUP) president, is holding on to the US State Department's statement last week that during his meeting with Mr. Marcos, “President [Joe] Biden will reaffirm the United States’ ironclad commitment to the defense of the Philippines and the leaders will discuss efforts to strengthen the long-standing US-Philippines alliance.”
Marcos and Biden met at the White House in Washington DC on Tuesday, May 2.
Villafuerte crossed his fingers on such a final agreement as he continued to slam regional giant China for its supposed acts of aggression in the WPS, including the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ).
“With Beijing ignoring time and again the hundreds of diplomatic protests that have been filed by Manila over the nonstop intrusions of Chinese vessels into the WPS, I believe the best approach we can take at this point to put an end to such bullying tactics is for us to double down on plans for joint patrols in the disputed waterway with the US and other allies like Japan and Australia that seem open to such a border security arrangement,” Villafuerte said.
More than 200 diplomatic protests have reportedly been lodged by the Philippines against China in recent years.
“That the incessant harassment of Philippine vessels in our very own territory have been increasing despite the series of  official  engagements between Beijing and Manila, ostensibly in pursuit of a peaceful resolution to this territorial dispute only illustrates that the Philippine government’s filing of diplomatic protests over and over  against such Chinese bullying is a futile approach,"" he noted.
Villafuerte further said that China ""has repeatedly made a mockery of its diplomatic talks and avowed commitments with the Philippines on pursuing a peaceful settlement of the conflict, as such formal engagements this year have only become a prelude to more, instead of less, Chinese intrusions into our territorial waters and EEZ"".
During Marcos’ visit to China last January, he and Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to address the maritime issues “through diplomacy and dialogue and never through coercion and intimidation"".
Marcos' stateside trip will last five days.

During his meeting with the Filipino community here on Monday, May 1, Marcos once again highlighted the contribution of Filipinos in various fields abroad, saying ""kinuha na natin lahat (we've got it all).
He told them that they were among the foundations that strengthens the Philippines' relationship with the US.
""You are valued members now of American society. Your success here has made us very, very proud back home,"" Marcos said.
""I take pride in being your elected President, but more than anything I am honored to stand among you and say: Pilipino ako (I am a Filipino),” Marcos added.
With this, the President has told them that they can expect support and help from the government as a gesture of gratitude for their sacrifices for their families and the country.
'Visit the Philippines'
In his speech, Marcos also called on Filipino-Americans to encourage their children and grandchildren to visit the Philippines to see the richness of Philippine culture and history.
""Let them see for themselves what the Philippines is about, what is our culture, what is our history. I’m sure the first and second and third generation Filipino-Americans are more than happy to learn about their proud Philippine ancestry. Sooner or later, we will be able to welcome you back home to the Philippines, especially those who have reacquired their Filipino citizenship,” he said.
He also reassured overseas Filipino workers of the government’s sustained efforts to make the Philippines better and vowed to boost the quality of jobs so that time will come when Filipinos would no longer have to go abroad out of necessity.
The meeting with the Filipino community was held at the Ritz Carlton Hotel here.

109,US expected to send seven military assets to PH,Joseph Pedrajas,"May 2, 2023 ","The United States is set to send at least seven military assets to the Philippines pending congressional requirements as both countries join forces to counter threats in the Indo-Pacific.
Washington said it intends to transfer to Manila two Island-class patrol vessels; two Protector-class patrol vessels; and three C-130H aircraft, according to the fact sheet provided by the White House during President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.'s US state visit.
The US government is only awaiting applicable notification requirements from the Congress, it added.
The new batch of assets will follow the initial ones already deployed by Washington in April, which are two Cyclone-class coastal patrol vessels that are already on their way to Manila.
""These transfers will support the Armed Forces of the Philippines' (AFP) modernization program by enhancing its maritime and tactical lift capabilities,"" White House said.
In a meeting with Marcos at the White House, US President Joe Biden reaffirmed Washington's ""ironclad"" commitment to protect the Philippines against any armed attack. That is what he and other American officials have repeatedly been saying in the past.
The pronouncement was constantly raised as China, US' main rival, continues its aggressive behavior in the South China Sea and in the West Philippine Sea.
But the US' possible deployment of new assets is not only about that.
Washington also aims to ""modernize"" its alliance with Manila and build a ""strong and resilient architecture that is designed to meet emerging challenges, while routinizing joint planning and improving interoperability,"" according to White House.
Both sides also agreed to adopt a Bilateral Defense Guidelines to institutionalize the following: key bilateral priorities, mechanisms, and processes to deepen alliance cooperation and interoperability across land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace.
The upcoming guidelines will ""support the continued modernization of the alliance and ongoing efforts to adapt alliance coordination to respond to the evolving security environment,"" White House said.
In the guidelines, both countries will advance efforts to deepen interoperability, particularly through enhanced bilateral planning; information-sharing; accelerated defense capability development; and collaboration on emerging security challenges.
Amid criticisms against the new Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) sites in the Philippines, Washington vowed to work :closely with communities in the vicinity...to fully realize their positive value for local development and for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.""
""To that end, the United States will expand our work in these communities and areas to support health, education, environmental protection, economic growth, and disaster preparedness,"" White House said.
Marcos pushed for strengthened military alliance with the US as he met Biden during his first state visit there. The reason for which was that the Philippines found itself in ""arguably the most complicated geopolitical situation in the world right now.""
""And so it is only natural that — for the Philippines to look to its sole treaty partner in the world, to strengthen and to redefine the relationship that we have and the roles that we play in the face of these tensions that we see now around the South China Sea and the Asia-Pacific and Indo-Pacific region,"" he said in his opening statement.

In his opening statement at their bilateral meeting, Biden said he believed that both countries' relationship has to evolve as they continue to face new challenges.
""I’m using your phrase — 'to evolve as we face the challenges of this new century.' And we are facing new challenges. And I can’t think of any better partner to have than you,"" Biden told Marcos during their meeting on Monday afternoon here, May 1 (US time).
""I couldn’t agree more that we have to. This relationship has to continue to evolve,"" he added.
Biden was referring to what Marcos told him when they met in New York on the sidelines of the  77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) last September 2022.
The US President said they must continue to put emphasis on their climate change efforts, accelerate both countries’ transition to clean energy, and to stand up for their shared democratic values and workers’ rights and the rule of law.
""And together, we’re deepening our economic cooperation, which is going to continue to deepen and I think is mutually beneficial,"" Biden said.
""And the United States remains ironclad in our commitment to the defense of the Philippines, including the South China Sea, and we’re going to continue to support the Philippines’ military modernization goals,"" he added.
Biden stressed that both countries not only share a strong partnership, but a deep friendship — ""one that has been enriched by millions of Filipino Americans in the communities all across the United States of America.""

111,"High-level exchanges, trade missions part of US’ commitment to PH",Raymund Antonio,"May 2, 2023 ","The decades-long ties between the Philippines and United States (US) would be further strengthened by a number of economic cooperation initiatives agreed upon during the meeting between US President Joe Biden and President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. during their meeting at the White House on Monday, May 1 (US time).
Most important among these new arrangements and initiatives is the Presidential Trade and Investment Mission that Biden intends to dispatch to Manila “to enhance U.S. companies’ investment in the Philippines’ innovation economy, its clean energy transition and critical minerals sector, and the food security of its people.”
The “first mission of its kind,” a White House statement said the mission would “feature the highest caliber of U.S. business leaders.”
The US, pending Congressional notification, also plans to open a brick-and-mortar Open RAN Interoperability Lab in Manila with an aim “to advance a secure 5G rollout in the Philippines, strengthen its innovation economy, and provide digital upskilling opportunities to Philippine workers.”
The Lab would provide hands-on training to current and aspiring 5G professionals, as well as open opportunities for vendors and operators deploying Open RAN worldwide to teach local engineers how to use the technology, the White House said.
Furthermore, Washington would bring the Indo-Pacific Business Forum to the Philippines as both countries would host the 6th annual Indo-Pacific Business Forum (IPBF) in Manila in 2024.
The IPBF, which is the US’ marquee annual commercial event in the region, convened high-level delegates from the public and private sector “leaders to review policy developments, announce new investments, and identify new commercial partnerships.”
White House said the forum would “strengthen the Philippines’ position as a key hub for regional supply chains and high-quality investment.”
While the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has been a partner of the Philippines for years, the US plans to further this by launching a new partnership to “scale up” infrastructure development in the Philippines and support the construction of high-quality railways, ports, and transport systems.
This 2023, the USTDA is expected to leverage over $3 billion in public and private financing for the launch of new sustainable infrastructure programs intended to boost the Philippines’ mineral supply chains, smart grid technologies and clean energy solutions, 5G deployment, airport security and maritime safety, and healthcare infrastructure.
Both countries also plan to expand their air transportation links and space cooperation through the formalization of a technical aviation dialogue at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Transportation Ministerial Meeting in Detroit and the first-ever US-Philippines Civil Space Dialogue.
The Philippines would learn from the US’ best practices in using space-based technology for disaster management and emergency response, healthcare, mapping of resources and accessibility, pollution monitoring, deforestation, land use and infrastructure planning, and maritime awareness.
The White House statement said that both countries “have long supported high-quality investment, good jobs, and sustained economic growth in both countries.”
Employees of US companies in the Philippines earn annual wages that are 50 percent above the average family’s income.
Concentrix, a US business services company, is the Philippines’ largest private sector employer, while US investment firm KKR invested $1 billion in Philippine telecom infrastructure in 2022.

""As we had started to plan our way out of the pandemic economy, even the financial experts, we would talk about the economy, we would talk about the more strictly financial aspects of the development economy, we still keep coming back to agriculture and we cannot do all of the things that we would like to do for our economy if our agriculture is not -—there are agricultural system—is not strengthened,"" Marcos said on Monday (Washington time) during a series of meetings with US Cabinet officials.

115,Biden reaffirms US support to PH over attacks at sea,Betheena Unite,"May 2, 2023 ","WASHINGTON, D.C.— The United States has once again affirmed its support to the Philippines over attacks against its armed forces and public vessels in the Pacific, including the South China Sea.
Stressing its ""ironclad alliance commitments"" to the Philippines, US President Joe Biden said any armed attack on the Philippines' armed forces and vessels would compel them to enforce its mutual defense commitments with the Philippines.
""President Biden reaffirms the United States’ ironclad alliance commitments to the Philippines, underscoring that an armed attack on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea, would invoke U.S. mutual defense commitments under Article IV of the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty,"" the joint statement read after President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.'s meeting with Biden at the White House here on Monday afternoon, May 1.
Biden and Marcos also underscored their commitment to freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea, and the importance of respecting the sovereign rights of states within their exclusive economic zones consistent with international law.
They both support the right and ability of Filipino fisherfolk to pursue their traditional livelihoods.
The leaders note the ruling of the 2016 arbitral tribunal, constituted pursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

116,"Marcos' US visit has already produced benefits, says Romualdez",Ellson Quismorio,"May 2, 2023 ","It didn't take long for President Ferdinand 'Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.'s visit to the United States (US) to produce benefits for the Philippines.
Thus, said Speaker Martin Romualdez as he gave an update about Marcos' stateside trip to House of Representatives reporters.
He said that on the second day of his five-day official visit to the US, Marcos met with American President Joe Biden at the White House, where they resolved to draw on the strength of the enduring partnership between the two countries to promote economic growth and prosperity in the US, the Philippines, and the broader Indo-Pacific region.
Among others, President Biden said he will dispatch a presidential trade and investment mission to the Philippines on his behalf as he also committed to step up America’s support in a wide range of issues, including climate change mitigation and the economy.
“This high-level trade and investment mission from the US will add more momentum to sustain our country’s economic growth and help establish the Philippines as a hub for investments and as a regional supply chain hub,” Romualdez, Leyte's 1st district congressman, said.
“Such bilateral economic engagement with the US will not only generate more jobs and business opportunities for our people but, more importantly, it would focus on sectors critical to ensuring a resilient supply chain to avert the recurrence of serious disruptions that wreaked havoc in the economies of many countries in the past few years,” he added.
Romualdez--arguably Marcos' top ally in Philippine legislature and his most trusted lieutenant overall--has been in the US since mid-April.
He laid down the groundwork for the Philippine leader's arrival through a series of engagements with US lawmakers and private business leaders where they discussed means of elevating the Philippine-US partnership to new heights.
The House Speaker noted that prior to the meeting between the two leaders at the Oval Office, Marcos led the Philippine delegation in sealing new trade and investment deals with private firms, as well as cooperation agreements with the US government.
Earlier on Monday, Marcos witnessed the historic signing of a memorandum of agreement (MOA) between Integrated Micro-Electronics Inc. of the Ayala Group and California-based Zero Motorcycles on a partnership to manufacture electric motorcycles in the Philippines.
Top nuclear energy firm NuScale Power Corporation expressed interest to invest in the Philippines after a meeting with Marcos in Washington DC and bared plans for a study to locate an appropriate site in the country for its Small Modular Reactor, a compact yet proven safe nuclear power plant.
The Philippines and the US have also agreed to set up a ministerial team on agricultural cooperation during a meeting between Marcos and US Department of Agriculture officials led by Secretary Thomas Vilsack.
“US agriculture technology will be of immense value in helping us not only enhance the productivity of our agricultural sectors but also in combatting the ill effects of climate change, particularly now that we are facing the threat of the El Nino phenomenon,” said Romualdez, who accompanied Marcos and other members of the Philippine delegation during the meetings with US business and government leaders.
Apart from scoring gains in the area of economy, Romualdez said the Marcos-Biden meeting also bolstered the long-standing security alliance between the two countries.

Kung umikot ito, malaking perwisyo sa anak natin, sa apo natin, sa mga susunod nating henerasyon ng Pilipino. Sisirain tayo nito (We are now at the point where the police had seized billions of pesos worth of illegal drugs. Just recently they confiscated P4 billion worth of illegal drugs in Baguio. If these get into the streets, this will be a huge problem to our children, grandchildren and the next Filipino generations. This will destroy us),’’ Abalos noted.

122,"Gatchalian to MIAA, DOTr: Pour all attention to details on NAIA power outage",Hannah Torregoza,"May 2, 2023 ","Senator Sherwin Gatchalian on Tuesday, May 2 urged airport officials to pay attention to all details as they strive to resolve the power outage that hit the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 3 during Labor Day. 
 
Gatchalian lamented the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) nor the Department of Transportation (DOTr) have been prepared with yet another internal issue, which was identified this time as coming from the NAIA Terminal 3’s main circuit breaker.
 
“Authorities have identified that NAIA Terminal 3’s main circuit breaker caused the May 1 power outage at the terminal, which is an internal issue. Officials of the NAIA should immediately conduct an audit of all its facilities, including an electrical audit, and make the necessary upgrade if need be,” Gatchalian said in a statement.
 
“Hindi katanggap-tanggap na nangyari na naman ang ganitong insidente ilang buwan lamang makalipas na maparalisa ang ating buong air transport system pagpasok ng bagong taon (It is unacceptable that such an incident has happened again only a few months after our entire air transport system was paralyzed at the beginning of the new year),” he further said.
 
“We should have learned our lessons from the New Year incident and appropriate redundancy measures should have been put into place to avoid a repeat of such incident,” added the senator.
 
Authorities have identified a “fault current’ as the cause of the glitch but officials are still looking into other possible issues such as sabotage.
 
At this point, however, Gatchalian said the MIAA, DOTr and airline companies should ensure that passenger rights, including the right to compensation and amenities, are observed and adhered to whenever there are delayed or cancelled flights. 
 
“They must always attend to the needs of stranded passengers and ensure their safety and convenience until normal airport operations are restored,” he said. 
 
“Authorities should ensure that the public, particularly affected passengers, are apprised of the latest situation and are given appropriate notice of any new flight schedule at all times,” added the lawmaker.
 
“Anumang pagkagambala o pagkaantala ng ating mga sistemang pang-transportasyon ay nagdudulot ng masamang epekto sa ating ekonomiya. Dapat natin itong pagbuhusan ng pansin para hindi na pauilit-ulit ang mga insidenteng ganito (Any interruption or delay of our transportation systems has an adverse effect on our economy. We should pay attention to it so that incidents like this don't happen again),” Gatchalian stressed.
Sen. Risa Hontiveros, Senate deputy minority leader, expressed her disappointment, recalling that when the Senate investigated the disruptions at the NAIA that occurred earlier this year, concerned government agencies assured lawmakers that no major problems “like the one we experienced won’t happen again.”
 
At the same time, Hontiveros pointed out it how the recent operational problem occurred on January 1, a holiday and the latest the occur was also on a holiday, May 1 which is Labor Day. 
 
“Coincidence lang ba na napupurnada ang lakad ng mga kababayan natin kapag mga araw ng bakasyon? May kaugnayan ba rito ang pinaplanong privatization ng NAIA? O talagang dinededma tayo ng mga pabayang namamahala sa NAIA kaya wala nang tamang pagpaplano para sa mga airport (Is it just a coincidence that our countrymen's walk is blocked during vacation days? Is the planned privatization of NAIA related to this? Or are the negligent management of NAIA really hurting us so there is no proper planning for airports)?” Hontiveros noted.
 
“Ano pa man ang dahilan, malinaw na hindi uubra ang economic recovery na hinahangad natin matapos ang pandemya kung magpapatuloy ang ganitong mga kapalpakan (Whatever the reason, it is clear that the economic recovery we seek after the pandemic will not work if these failures continue)!” she pointed out. 
 
Hontiveros said she hopes that the flight cancellations won’t affect the jobs of the country’s overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), especially in destination countries where employers cancel contracts based on strict re-entry rules.
 
“In case this happens, it should be the duty of the government to negotiate on their behalf to ensure that their jobs are protected),” she said.

The 11,013 represents a surge of 200 percent when compared to the 3,714 Filipino nursing graduates that took the NCLEX, or National Council Licensure Examination, for the first time in the same three-month period in 2022, according to Rillo.
Rillo has been batting for the passage of House Bill (HB) No.5276, which seeks to boost from P36,619 to P63,997 the minimum base of nurses in government hospitals.

The World Health Organization (WHO) previously projected that “without action, there will be a shortfall of 4.6 million nurses worldwide by 2030"".
In the Philippines, the WHO said the shortage of nurses is expected to be 249,843 by 2030, “unless greater investment is made now to retain them in the local health sector"".

The President was finally able to raise this, personally, to Biden.
He told Biden that the Philippines found itself in ""arguably the most complicated geopolitical situation in the world right now.""

In a statement on Monday, May 1, the BFP said that from the 953 recorded fire incidents in 2022, the number jumped to 1,332 in the country this month.
With the soaring fire incidents, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) and the BFP called on the public to take the necessary precautions to prevent fire incidents especially during the soaring heat of the summer months.
The BFP pointed to the rise in the demand for electricity which may have compromised the faulty electric wires; dried leaves, grass and garbage materials which easily catch fire or lighted cigarette butts as major causes of fire incidents.
DILG Secretary Benjamin “Benhur” Abalos, Jr. urged the local government units (LGUs) to conduct inspects and coordinate with the BFP to ensure the strict adherence of the establishments to the regulations in Republic Act 9514 other wise known as the “Fire Code of the Philippines (FCP.’’
“Tiyakin natin na ang mga buildings ay mayroong fire exits, fire protection systems tulad ng sprinklers, hose box, at iba pang fire safety features alinsunod sa Fire Code of the Philippines. Huwag po nating ipagwalang-bahala ang mga ganitong bagay dahil buhay at kaligtasan ng ating mga kababayan ang nakasalalay rito (Let us make sure that the buildings have fire exits, fire protection systems like sprinklers, hose box and other fire safety features pursuant to the Fire Code of the Philippines. Let us not disregard these things since lives and the safety of our fellowmen are at stake here),’’ Abalos asserted.

Based on the BOC data, the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service (CIIS) at the Manila International Container Port (MICP) was responsible for the anti-smuggling operations in Indanan, Sulu last March that resulted to the major apprehension of a warehouse of 19,000 master cases.
”The big bulk of the smuggled cigarettes was seized in Indanan, Sulu and it’s now destroyed and will be disposed in a sanitary landfill,” said Intelligence Officer 3 Alvin Enciso, chief of CIIS-MICP.

Port of Zamboanga (POZ) Acting District Collector Eng’r Arthur G. Sevilla, Jr. said the big haul was made possible with the leadership of Intelligence Group (IG) Deputy Commissioner Juvymax Uy and the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service (CIIS) Director Verne Enciso after a major apprehension of a warehouse full of cigarettes in Indanan, Sulu back in March.
The condemned master cases of cigarettes were seized for violating Section 117 of R.A. 10863 or the “Customs Modernization and Tariff Act (CMTA) of 2016 in relation to Executive Order Number 245 entitled “Amended Rules and Regulations Governing the Exportation and Importation of Leaf Tobacco and Tobacco Products.""
The condemnation of seized goods by the BOC-POZ is consistent with President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.’s standing order to implement anti-smuggling and border control measures in the country.

135,"PBBM should recall ambassador to Beijing over Ayungin near-collision, solon says",Hannah Torregoza,"May 1, 2023 "," 
Cagayan de Oro City 2nd District Rep. Rufus Rodriguez on Monday, May 1 called on President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. to consider recalling the country’s ambassador to Beijing as a show of protest and displeasure over the near-collision incident between a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) patrol and a Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) vessel.
 
Aside from the usual filing of a diplomatic note, Rodriguez said Malacañang should order the country’s principal representative in China, Jaime Flor Cruz, a former journalist who covered China for many years for American news organizations, to return home. 
 
“He should not go back to Beijing until we receive a response from the Chinese government apologizing for their harassment and bullying tactics in the West Philippine Sea and committing to rectify their misconduct,” Rodriguez said.
 
The lawmaker noted the Philippines has filed hundreds of protest notes against Beijing over China's aggressive and bullying activities but to no avail.
 
In 2022 alone, 193 protest notes were served, including 65 by the Marcos administration, he pointed out.
 
“All these protestations fell on deaf ears. That is why they continue to harass and bully our Coast Guard patrols and our fishermen, from the northern part of our country in Pangasinan and Zambales to the south in Palawan,” he added.
 
At the same time, Rodriguez lauded the “unequivocal, clear commitment by the US government” in response to the recent near-collision incident, which happened in the Ayungin Shoal area, where a small contingent of Filipino soldiers is stationed in an old, rusting Navy ship.
 
“The reiteration of US obligations under the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty is very reassuring,” he said.
 
“It’s unthinkable for a tiny craft like BRP Malapascua to provoke a huge ship like a Chinese Coast Guard patrol vessel. It defies logic,” he added.
 
“They do the same with our fishermen in Scarborough Shoal near Zambales and Pangasinan,” he further said, also citing how the Chinese Coast Guard routinely harass and bully PCG ships and small boats resupplying Filipino soldiers stationed in Ayungin Shoal off Palawan.

136,"Zubiri: Senate to pursue wage hike, other laws advancing Filipino workers' rights",Mario Casayuran,"May 1, 2023 ","Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri on Monday, May 1, renewed his commitment to pushing for legislation that would protect and advance the interests of workers across the country, particularly with regard to the pressing need for a wage hike.
“This Labor Day, I join all our workers in fighting for decent benefits, living wages, and fair working conditions,” Zubiri said.
“This is especially crucial as rising costs of goods and utilities continue to hit our people’s pockets, to the point that even toiling with a full-time job is no longer enough to support their families’ needs, he added.” Good evening.
On the other hand, Senate President Pro Tempore Loren Legarda said: ""My heart swells with gratitude and admiration for the hardworking men and women who tirelessly contribute to the progress of our beloved country.’’
""On this special day, we honor the labor force of the Philippines, the backbone of our economy, whose dedication and unwavering spirit empower our nation to rise above challenges,’’ she stressed.
""May this Labor Day be a reminder of our shared responsibility to build a just and equitable society where all workers can thrive and prosper,’’ she pointed out.
""As your senator, I am committed to championing the rights and welfare of our workers, ensuring fair wages, safe working conditions, and access to social protection. Together, let us strive for an environment where every laborer is valued, respected, and given the opportunity to succeed,’’ she added.
Zubiri pointed out that the National Capital Region (NCR) currently has the highest daily nominal wage rate, at P570.00 (non-agriculture), while the lowest is at P316.00 (non-agriculture), for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).
At the onset of 2023, the Philippines saw its highest inflation rate in fourteen years, hitting 8.7 percent.
“We urgently need to address the growing gap between wages and expenses, which is why last March, I filed an across-the-board wage increase act.” Zubiri said.
Zubiri’s Senate Bill No. 2002, or the Across-the-Board Wage Increase Act of 2023, seeks to raise wages in the private sector across all regions by P150.
“We must uplift our workers, and ensure that they get the compensation they deserve. Workers form the foundation of the entire business sector, and without them, our economy and country will fall apart,’’ he emphasized.
‘’So let us give them their due. By providing a true living wage, we empower our workers to support not only their families and their communities, but also the country at large,’’ he said.

137,"Tolentino wants clearer definition of PH territory, inclusion of cyber-attack provision in PH-US MDT",Mario Casayuran,"May 1, 2023 ","Senator Francis Tolentino on Monday, May 1, sought a clearer definition of the Philippine territory under the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) with the United States.
In a radio DZBB interview today, Tolentino, vice-chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, suggested the inclusion of territories where the Philippine government currently exercises ""sovereign rights.""
“Kung ako po ang mag a-amendya nito… hindi lamang sa metropolitan territory, sa land mass island territory (ng Pilipinas) sa Pacific Ocean, mayroon pang iba ((If i were to amend the MDT, it is not only the metropolitan territory, the land mass island territory because there are others). Kung liliwanagin po iyan, pwede pong idagdag: where it exercises  sovereign rights (If that were to be made clearer, we should add: Where it exercises sovereign rights),” he said.
Tolentino issued the statement in connection with the upcoming meeting between President Ferdinand ‘’Bongbong’’ R. Marcos Jr. and United States President Joe Biden wherein, defense, security, and other geopolitical matters are expected to be discussed by the two leaders.
The senator suggested a new provision in which, “any attack on a place where it exercises sovereign rights (for both parties) would trigger MDT.”
“Yung where effects on the exercise of sovereign rights, puwede siguro pag-usapan para maliwanag na kapag inatake tayo sa ating exclusive economic zone, ay pasok na pasok sa Mutual Defense Treaty as amended (We could clarify the effects on the exercise of sovereign rights in that the MDT comes into play when there is an attack in Philippine exclusive economic zone),’’ he said.
This is important considering the current geopolitical tension of claimant countries in the South China Sea region, particularly in the disputed territories located in the West Philippine Sea, the lawmaker pointed out.
Tolentino stressed that the mere presence of the American military in the region is already “a psychological reinforcement itself of our historical ties with the United States.”
“Malaking bagay po iyon na alam natin na-andyan sila (The presence of the American military is a big factor). So sa halip na gumatos po tayo ng malaki para ma improve yung sandatahang lakas, mayroon tayong kaalyado na handang tumulong (So instead of spending so much on improving our military, the Philippines has a strong ally ready to help,’’ he said.
Tolentino also suggested for the Philippine government to seek an upgraded compensation, not only under the MDT but also with other existing treaties with the world’s ‘super power,’ specifically the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and the recently expanded Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), which would be given to local government units (LGUs) that would be hosting those non-permanent U.S. bases in the country.
“Dagdagan at i-klaro rin yung itutulong pamahalaang lokal na magho-host—siguro dapat matulungan sa kanilang educational system, magtayo ng eskwelahan, at kung mayroong kapabilidad na magtayo ng maliliit na ospital kasi marami namang mga doktor ang sandatahang lakas ng Estados Unidos (Local government units that would host the US military should be given assistance in their educational system, construction of schools and if they are not capable of constructing small hospitals the  US has many doctors),’’ he added.
At this turning point of the ""modern warfare"" era, Tolentino also sought the inclusion of a ""cyber-attack"" provision under MDT considering that the battlefield right now it’s not just only about the conventional armed conflict, but it also include the skirmishes along the cyberspace, noting that there are reports of the so-called ""state-sponsored"" cyber-attack.
“Kasi kung magkaroon ng cyber-attack sa banking system natin, collapse po lahat yan—armed attack din po iyon (It is considered an armed attack if there are cyber-attacks on the banking system because they will collapse). Kapag inatake din po yung mga government institutions po natin gaya nung nangyari na may data leaks daw sa National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), ay considered as armed attack din po iyon (It is also considered an armed attack if there are attacks on government institutions, such as data leaks at the National Bureau of Investigation),” e said.
Tolentino emphasized that he wants an amendment of Article 5 of the 1951 MDT, to include provisions on attack on cybersecurity especially when it would be made on critical infrastructure of the governments and other vital installations, considering that it might jeopardize the overall operations of either parties.
“Kapag nag cyber-attack, sira pati ang banking system. Sira pati lahat ng critical government infrastructures—brownouts, blackouts nationwide, pati telecommunications (A cyber-attack destroys critical government infrastructures - brownouts, blackout nationwide and even telecommunications),’’  he added.
He explained that a counterattack during a state-sponsored cyber-attack “should be commensurate” and doesn’t need a direct confrontation with the opposing party.

138,Pimentel backs proposed legislated wage hike,Mario Casayuran,"May 1, 2023 ","Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III on Monday, May 1, threw his support behind a number of bills at the Upper Chamber seeking to raise the minimum wage in the country.
Pimentel said the increase is long overdue.
“There is no way a family of five can live a decent life with the current minimum wage of P570 in Metro Manila,” he said.
The Senate chief fiscalizer advised the government to go beyond holding job fairs and distributing ayuda (assistance) during Labor Day.
“I think we need to be more imaginative now in responding to the needs of our labor sector given the new reality that life is very difficult nowadays,” Pimentel said in a TV interview.
“Job fairs and ayuda are regular programs of the government,” he pointed out.
“The government should express support for legislated wage hikes,” he added.
“Sa tingin ko, kailangan na (I think it is about rime). It is about time to review the amounts. The legislated minimum wage can live side-by-side with our decentralized wage system,” Pimentel stressed.
The country has wage boards across all regions that set the minimum wage in every region.
However, Pimentel noted the need to consider the economic and business implications of the legislated wage increase.
“We have to balance the interest of the MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises), which could not afford the mandatory wage hike, with the needs of our workers,” he said.
There are about 21 pending measures in the Senate calling for wage increase.
“If passed, this move will improve the lives of millions of workers who are struggling to make ends meet on their current wages,” Pimentel said in a statement.
“We must ensure that Filipinos are paid a fair wage hike for their work so they can put food on the table and provide a better future for their families,” according to Pimentel in a separate statement.
“Life is also hard outside Metro Manila. We need to do something to improve the standard of living and the quality of life of our countrymen,” he added.

139,"Binay: PH travel now becoming an unpleasant, frustrating experience for travelers",Mario Casayuran,"May 1, 2023 ","Senator Nancy Binay lamented that the power outage at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 3 is sending a message that the Philippines has become an unpleasant and frustrating experience for travelers.
""Only a few months after the New Year power outage that crippled aviation and airport operations, we are again in every social media portal, news channel and newspaper across the world,’’ Binay, chairperson of the Senate tourism committee, said.
The lady lawmaker said that today’s (Monday, May 1) incident pointed to a string of inadequacies that showed how weak, bad and vulnerable our airports are.
""Para bang tuwing nasa kalagitnaan ang lahat ng long weekend, laging may aberya na nangyayari sa ating mga airport (What is happening is that after a long weekend, there are incidents at the airport) —almost always, passengers have to deal with bad airline experiences, plus the string of technical glitches. Our gateway to the Philippines has literally become a port of inconvenience to travelers and tourists,’’ she added.
""What happened to the backup and redundant systems that the DOTr (Department of Transportation) and MIAA  (Manila International Airport Authority) promised to upgrade?,’’ she asked.
""Yes, we expect a certain amount of chaos during holidays and peak seasons. But now, outages and technical glitches seem to have become a common occurrence at our airports--'di na tayo natuto (we have not learned),’’ she added.

140,"Tulfo: Rotational brownouts might continue to pester Panay, Negros in the coming days",Mario Casayuran,"May 1, 2023 ","The chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy has expressed concern that the rotational brownouts in the islands of Panay and Negros, which started last April 27, could possibly continue in the coming days.
Senator Raffy Tulfo, committee chairman, said he was initially informed that the power outages started due to the line fault or tripping in the transmission line of the  National Grid Corporation (NGCP).
The NGCP, however, is blaming the Central Negros Electric Cooperative (CENECO), the senator pointed out
“Tinawagan na namin ang DOE (Department of Energy) at ERC (Energy Regulatory Commission) para paimbestigahan ang problema at kung sino talaga ang pinag-ugatan dahil nagtuturuan ang NGCP at CENECO (We called up the DOE snd ERC so they could investigate the problem and who is really at fault as NGCP and CENECO are blaming each other),’’ he stressed.
Tulfo recalled that it was 8 A.M. yesterday, April 30, when he received information stating that the cause of the power outages in Panay and Negros was the transmission line of the NGCP. This prompted him to urgently create an investigation and monitoring team to look into the problem.
First off, Tulfo said he and his team had a conference call with NGCP to allow the latter to explain.
He said the NGCP pointed put that the problem is not with them because the tripping or line fault allegedly originated from the line of CENECO, and that there was a domino effect that’s why their line was also affected, thereby causing power outages even in Panay
Tulfo added that NGCP said that in case like this wherein there is a line fault or tripping, there should be protection systems to prevent the fault from spreading.
While NGCP claimed that its protection system worked as intended, Tulfo questioned why Panay was affected even though its electricity was not being supplied by CENECO.
Tulfo and his team also called CENECO. He shared that according to the cooperative, there was voltage fluctuation and frequency imbalance in the 69kV line that is under the management of NGCP.
CENECO likewise claimed that this problem also affected MORE, GUIMELCO, ILECO 1, ILECO 2, ILECO 3, ANTECO, CAPELCO and AKELCO which NGCP already admitted to them last April 28 while purportedly giving then warning that there was a short supply in the grid.
Tulfo said that CENECO even said that all the electric cooperatives in Panay and Negros already issued a unified stand pointing to the NGCP as the root of the problem.
Meanwhile, in Tulfo’s and his team’s discussion  with DOE and ERC, the senator underscored the need for them to conduct an in-depth investigation of what really happened and who is at fault to prevent this kind of power outages from happening again, not only in Panay and Negros but also in other parts of the country.
For now, Tulfo said he and his team continue to monitor the situation.

141,Senators slam NAIA power outage,Mario Casayuran,"May 1, 2023 ","The Department of Transportation (DOTr) and the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) officials have not learned from past mistakes, Senator Grace Poe said.
Poe said the power outage at the NAIA Terminal 3 today, Monday, May 1, shows another disruptive failure of the airport systems causing grave inconvenience to travelers..
‘’The lack of functioning air conditioners in several parts of the airport is not only troublesome but could even be precarious to health especially of the elderly,’’ Senator Grace Poe, chairwoman of the Senate public services committee, said.
Hindi katanggap-tanggap na tuwing may brownout, maaantala ang buong sistema ng airport at ang byahe ng publiko (This is not acceptable that each time a power brownout takes place, the whole system at the airport is affected and It affects the traveling public),’’ she said.
‘’Parang di natututo ang DOTr at NAIA sa mga nauna nitong kapalpakan (As if DOYTr and NAIA have not learned from their past mistakes),’’ she added.
Senator Jinggoy Ejercito Estrada asked airport officials: ‘’Hindi pa ba tayo nadala (haven’t you learned)?. To the concerned aviation and transportation officials, have you had not enough yet?’’
‘’We’ve been in this situation last New Year’s Day and it was even worse. This power outage could have been avoided if the necessary measures are already in place, at least in having an uninterruptible power supply considering the thinning of power supply this summer season and when demand usually peaks,’’ he said.
Estrada said that the Senate Committee Report No. 39 already identified the absence of redundancy or systems backup as among the critical reasons that led to the airport shutdown last January 1 along with the issue of lack of real maintenance to the airport equipment.
‘’That would have been enough for our concerned officials to be on the lookout for situations like what we’re having now in NAIA Terminal 3,’’ he pointed out.
Estrada said this second incident this year fell on a holiday, Labor Day, where many travelers went to the airport.
‘’Panawagan sa ating mga concerned agencies: Maawa naman po kayo sa ating mga kababayan. Suklian naman natin ng nararapat na serbisyo ang mga binabayad nilang buwis (To our concerned agencies: Please pity our countrymen. You should repay the taxpayers with good service),’’ he said.

144,"DOLE reviews 10 wage hike petitions in NCR, 3 other regions; P1.8B assistance distributed on Labor Day",Aaron Recuenco,"May 1, 2023 ","The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) is currently reviewing 10 wage petitions in Metro Manila and three other regions which were filed amid the high inflation rate recorded in the country since last year.
DOLE Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said the wage petitions are currently pending before the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards (RTWPBs) in the National Capital Region, Region 4A (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon), Region 6 or Western Visayas and Region 7 or Central Visayas.
“All the arguments raised are being considered by our wage boards and we are hoping that this would be done properly and efficiently until wage orders are issued,” said Laguesma. 
DOLE Undersecretary Benjo Benavidez said the wage petitions would undergo the normal processes that include discussions on the form and substance of the need for wage hike and the conduct of regular hearings by regional wage boards.
“We allow the existing processes and mechanisms for these wave petitions in various parts of the country because that is what the law says pertaining to wage petitions,” said Benavidez.
The last wage hikes approved by DOLE’s regional wage boards in Metro Manila and other regions were last year, some of them to be implemented by tranches.
Meanwhile, DOLE has distributed over P1.8 billion worth of assistance to workers in celebration of this year’s Labor Day.
Laguesma said the assistance benefitted over 313,000 workers across the country and was distributed in various ceremonies in celebration of the Labor Day in various areas.
The amount includes the wages of informal sector workers employed under the Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers (TUPAD) program, livelihood assistance to vulnerable and marginalized workers under the DOLE Integrated Livelihood Program (DILP) or Kabuhayan Program, stipends of government interns under the DOLE-Government Internship Program (GIP), and salaries of young workers under the Special Program for Employment of Students (SPES). 
“These are among the labor department’s various programs in support of the government’s efforts to reinvigorate job creation and accelerate poverty reduction by steering the economy back on a high-growth path,” said Laguesma.

145,"DOTr eyes full NAIA electrical system audit after power outage cancels, delays flights anew",Aaron Recuenco,"May 1, 2023 ","The Department of Transportation is eyeing a full audit of the electrical system at the Terminal 3 of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) following a power outage on Monday morning, May 1, that affected more than 9,000 passengers from around 50 flights.
DOTr Secretary Jaime Bautista said they are also planning to include the NAIA Terminals 1 and 2 in the audit which is aimed at determining the worthiness of the entire system, identify what needs to be replaced and eventually ensure that electric system failure will not happen again in the future.

photo: DOTr
“This is something that is already being discussed by our technical people and we will do this as soon as possible,” said Bautista in a press briefing.
He said the entire audit requires a big budget and this may undergo the normal procurement process.
The full electric system audit for the Terminal 3 requires 60 to 90 days, according to Bautista, and this is expected to drag on if the two other busy NAIA terminals would be included.
Meralco, for its part, has committed assistance for the full audit. 
Bautista raised the necessity of the full audit after a team from Meralco which responded to the power outage at the NAIA Terminal 3 that occurred at 1:05 a.m. on Monday found out that the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) has no electrical system blueprint for Terminal 3.
During the initial inquiry, it was found out that the builder of the NAIA Terminal 3 did not turn over it along with other important documents pertaining to its building plan.
It was recalled that the NAIA Terminal 3 underwent a long legal battle between the government and its builder,  Philippine International Air Terminals Company Incorporated (Piatco), which was eventually won by the latter.
The operation of the Terminal 3 was turned over to the MIAA in 2009 while the last audit conducted was in 2017.
Bautista said some of the recommendations based on the 2017 audit were not implemented. 
Supposedly, the auditing of electric systems should be done every five years and MIAA admitted that it was not able to do it last year.
What went wrong
Technical teams from the MIAA and Meralco said they are now conducting an investigation to determine the reason behind the power outage.
But initially, Meralco engineer Noel Espiritu told reporters in the press briefing that it started when the fault indication system of the main circuit breaker shut down the system after detecting abnormalities in the flow of electricity within the NAIA Terminal 3 electrical system.
He added that the initial check on the system necessitated the replacement of one of the components of the electrical system which he named as the elbow component. 
Bautista, for his part, said the power use in the Terminal 3 may have increased overtime due to the presence of a number of concessionaires inside.
Fully restored
The power supply at the NAIA Terminal 3 was fully restored at 8:45 a.m. on Monday but Espiritu said there were already pockets of restorations a few hours before the full restoration. 
The power outage, however, affected a total of 9,391 passengers of the Cebu Pacific as its flights to and from NAIA Terminal 3 were either cancelled or delayed. 
MIAA General Manager Cesar Chiong, however, said that they will not close the Terminal 3 runways today to pave the way for recovery flights of affected airlines.

146,On Labor Day: PhilHealth reminds employers to remit workers' premiums on time,Luisa K. Cabato,"May 1, 2023 ","In light of the celebration of Labor Day on Monday, May 1, the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) reminded public and private employers to remit their employees' contributions on time.
PhilHealth acting President and Chief Executive Officer Emmanuel R. Ledesma, Jr. said that employers may use the Electronic Premium Remittance System to remit their employees’ contributions safely and conveniently to PhilHealth.
""We have recently enhanced the EPRS - our online payment facility for employers – in partnership with MyEG Philippines, to allow more payment options for employers such as electronic wallets GCash and Maya, along with debit and credit card payments,"" he said.
""The payment process has also been simplified with the EPRS. Kailangan lang mag-generate ang employer o ang PhilHealth Employer Engagement Representative o PEER ng Statement of Premium Accounts (SPA) para sa buwan na babayaran, pagkatapos ay piliin lang ang kanilang preferred payment option at magbayad na (The employer or the PhilHealth Employer Engagement Representative (PEER) just needs to generate a Statement of Premium Accounts (SPA) for the month to be paid, and then choose their preferred payment option and pay),"" Ledesma added.
A payment confirmation email will be immediately sent to employers after a successful transaction, the chief assured.
He also noted that PhilHealth has partnered with MyEG Philippines to support Republic Act No. 11032, or Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act.
This mandates government offices and agencies to adopt a digital payment system for disbursements and collections to promote the efficient delivery of services and speed up transactions.

147,Solon: Marcos gov’t should rechannel NTF-ELCAC funds to fuel subsidies for Occidental Mindoro,Hannah Torregoza,"May 1, 2023 "," 
House Deputy Minority leader and ACT Teacher's party-list  Rep. France Castro on Monday, May 1, urged the Marcos administration to rechannel the budget of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) to fund the fuel subsidies for Occidental Mindoro.
 
""Nasasayang lang talaga ang pera ng taumbayan sa P10-bilyong pondo inilaan sa NTF-ELCAC (The people's money is really wasted in the P10-billion fund allocated to NTF-ELCAC. 
 
In 2022, Castro noted that 12 barangays were given P20-million each under the Barangay Development Program (BDP). But the fund was not even used to ensure there is electricity in the province which the barangay constituents badly needed.
 
“Ngayon ay 6 na baranggay naman daw sa probinsya ang may P6.6-milyon kada isa (Now it is said that six barangays in the province each have P6.6-million),” she said.
 
""It must also be noted  that the Commission on Audit (COA) itself has trained its sights on the BDP in particular and the NYF-ELCAC in general. As it is, COA in its 2020 Annual Financial Report found ‘incomplete documentation, low fund utilization and unutilized funds, unauthorized fund transfers and lack of guidelines on the use of funds’ in the implementation of NTF-ELCAC projects in member-agencies like the DILG (Department of Interior and Local Government),"" she added.
 
While in the 2021 BDP funds, she said they have already pointed out its extremely  low utilization of less than 50 percent accomplishment rate as of December 2022.
 
Castro noted that based on the Local Budget Circular No. 151 released by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) 4.1, the SBDP shall be used by the 959 cleared barangays listed in Annex A either for farm-tomarket road, school building, water and sanitation system; health stations; and electrification, (projects),” said the deputy minority leader.
 
""But with the NTF-ELCAC's dismal implementation of its projects, it would be best that  not just the funds for the Occidental Mindoro baranggays are utilized for the fuel subsidies of the whole province and even that of Oriental Mindoro so that the charges would not be passwd through the province's electricity consumers or all electricity consumers of the country thru the universal charge,” the solon said.

148,Sec Remulla pays tribute to Filipino workers,Jeffrey Damicog,"May 1, 2023 ","Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Jesus Crispin C. Remulla on Monday, May 1, expressed gratitude to all Filipino workers who “help shape the country’s future.”
“Sa bawat indibidwal na manggagawang nagtitiyaga, nagpupunyagi, at nagpapalakas ng ating ekonomiya, tayo ay nagpapasalamat (For every worker who has shown perseverance and effort to make our economy strong, thank you),” Remulla said in a Facebook post.
“Sa araw na ito, sariwain natin ang halaga ng inyong kontribusyon, ang inyong pagbabago, at ang inyong papel sa paghubog ng kinabukasan (On this day, let us renew the importance of your contribution, your reforms, and roles in shaping our future),” he also said in his post on the celebration of Labor Day.
He pointed out that with their skill, the country’s workers have shown “ang tunay na galing at lakas ng Pilipino (the real talent and strength of Filipinos),” he added.

149,Mt. Kanlaon records highest sulfur dioxide emission for this year,Luisa K. Cabato,"May 1, 2023 ","Mount Kanlaon emitted 1,099 tonnes of volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2), the highest so far this year, on Sunday, April 30, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) advised on Monday morning, May 1.
""Volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas emission from the summit crater of Kanlaon based on campaign Flyspec measurements yesterday, 30 April 2023, averaged 1,099 tonnes/day, the highest value recorded this year. This is almost an order of magnitude higher than the average of 124 tonnes/day recorded since March 2023,"" said the agency.
The volcanic SO2 was first detected in early April.
""The Kanlaon Volcano network recorded one hundred and forty-one (141) volcanic earthquakes between 1 April and 30 April 2023, for an average of five (5) per day. These earthquakes occurred at shallow depths to depths of 10 kilometers across the northern to western portions of the edifice,"" Phivolcs said.
Also, data gathered through the Global Positioning System and electronic tilt meters showed that the volcano's lower and middle slopes had been slowly swelling since March.
This indicates slow pressurization inside the volcano, said Phivolcs.
""These parameters could indicate increased hydrothermal activity occurring beneath the edifice, possibly driven by degassing of even deeper magma, with increased possibilities of phreatic or steam-driven explosions occurring at the summit crater,"" it warned.
The agency also reminded that Alert Level 1 prevails over Mt. Kanlaon and the public and local government units need to be vigilant and refrain from entering the four-kilometer permanent danger zone due to increased chances of sudden and hazardous phreatic eruptions.
""Civil aviation authorities must also advise pilots to avoid flying close to the volcano’s summit as ejecta from any sudden phreatic eruption can be hazardous to aircraft. DOST-PHIVOLCS is closely monitoring Kanlaon Volcano’s activity and any new development will be relayed to all concerned,"" it added.

150,Sandigan affirms conviction of ex-Cebu town treasurer,Czarina Nicole Ong Ki,"May 1, 2023 ","The Sandiganbayan has affirmed the conviction of the former treasurer of Ronda town in Cebu as it also denied his motion for the inhibition of the justices who rendered the decision.
Affirmed was the guilty verdict imposed on Esperato A. Del Socorro in a decision handed down last Feb. 7.
Del Socorro was sentenced to six to 10 years imprisonment for his graft conviction with perpetual disqualification from holding public office. For his malversation conviction, he was sentenced to six to 10 years imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of P2,063,422.72. The anti-graft court also held him civilly liable for the amount of P2,063,422.72, which he should refund to the Bureau of Treasury.
In his motion for reconsideration, Del Socorro cited ""reversible error"" and prayed for his acquittal.  He also pleaded that “the Honorable Presiding Justices of the instant case"" should ""voluntarily inhibit themselves from acting upon the motion because of manifest bias and partiality.""
But the Sandiganbayan’s sixth division ruled that it would be an ""exercise in futility"" should it grant the motion to inhibit with motion for reconsideration.
It stressed that there is no compelling reason or cause for them to voluntarily inhibit because of ""unconscious bias.""
""In fine, the prized ideal of 'the cold neutrality of an impartial judge' implicit in the due process guarantee had been met,"" the court said.
It also said that since Del Socorro's motion for reconsideration merely contained ""warmed over arguments previously put forward and found to be unmeritorious, it would be an exercise in futility for the court to reiterate itself.”
Associate Justice Kevin Narce B. Vivero wrote the nine-page resolution with the concurrence of Chairperson Sarah Jane T. Fernandez and Associate Justice Karl B. Miranda.
Del Socorro was the co-accused of former Ronda mayor Esteban R. Sia, who had passed away. In light of his death, the charges against Sia had been dismissed.

151,BI nabs foreigner wanted in Korea,Jun Ramirez,"May 1, 2023 ","Bureau of Immigration (BI) agents have arrested an alleged Korean fugitive at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) while on his way out of the Philippines.
BI intelligence chief Fortunato Manahan Jr., said  the 31-year-old passenger, identified as Ko Daeyun, was arrested at the NAIA 3 terminal on April 25.
Ko was attempting to board a Cebu Pacific flight to Seoul when he was intercepted by operatives from the BI’s border control and intelligence unit (BCIU).
Upon presenting himself to a BI officer at the immigration departure counter, the officer discovered that Ko's name was on the BI's watchlist of wanted foreign fugitives.
Ko is currently facing a deportation case due to his being a fugitive from justice and has been charged for undesirability before the BI legal division.
Korean authorities said Ko is accused of being a member of a telecommunications fraud syndicate that uses voice phishing to defraud its victims.
The Korean allegedly lured a victim into giving him his debit card, and from October to December 2021, was able to withdraw over half a million won, nearly US$400,000, after promising the victim that the money would earn interest in a lending business.
Ko is currently detained at the BI detention facility in Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City, pending deportation proceedings.

152,"Rebate for all 'lifeline' customers in effect on May billing, Maynilad says",Manila Bulletin,"May 1, 2023 ","The  Maynilad Water Services, Inc. has announced a rebate for around 167,500 lifeline accounts in its service areas in Metro Manila.
In a statement, Maynilad said the 167,500 lifeline accounts were heavily affected by water service interruption due to the reduced production of the Putatan Water Treatment Plants.
Maynilad described  “lifeline” accounts as those which consume less than 10 cubic meters (cu.m.) in their monthly bill. 
Maynilad is granting the rebate in consideration of their “lifeline” customers who were forced to pay a minimum charge though they were not able to consume a full cubic meter. 
“They will get the rebate in their May 2023 water bill. The total rebate to be given amounts to ₱10.81 million,” the statement read.
The accounts are located in Pasay, parts of Makati, Parañaque, Muntinlupa, Las Piñas, and Cavite.
“The rebate will be equivalent to the cost of the unused portion of the lifeline customers’ 10-cu.m. minimum consumption for the month of March 2023. This means that if these customers only consumed 1 cu.m. in March but had to pay the ₱136.00 Minimum Charge for 10 cu.m., they will be entitled to a rebate of 9 cu.m., or ₱121.98,” the statement read.
“Hence, the rebate amount will vary, depending on the customers’ actual March 2023 consumption below 10 cu.m.” it added. 
The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System – Regulatory Office (MWSS RO) has approved Maynilad’s Rebate Program of Maynilad. (Nicole Magmanlac)

153,"Makati City, Taguig City urged to iron out ‘smooth transition’ to enforce SC’s final ruling on land dispute",Rey G. Panaligan,"May 1, 2023 ","Both the Makati and the Taguig city governments have been asked to iron out a “smooth transition” in the implementation of the 2021 Supreme Court’s (SC) final decision which declared as owned by Taguig City the 729-hectare Bonifacio Global City Complex and several barangays in Makati City.
The appeal was aired by former Makati City vice mayor Ernesto Mercado as he pointed out that the SC will no longer accept any pleadings, motions, letters or any communication on the land dispute case.
Mercado quoted SC Spokesperson Brian Keith Hosaka who said that the SC had dismissed the omnibus motion of the Makati City government for the elevation of the case to the SC’s full court.
In its 2021 decision, the SC ruled that based on historical, documentary, and testimonial evidence, the contested areas fall within the territorial jurisdiction of Taguig City.
Written by Justice Ricardo R. Rosario, the decision declared permanent the 1994 injunction issued by the Pasig City regional trial court (RTC) which stopped the Makati City government “from exercising jurisdiction over, making improvements on, or otherwise treating as part of its territory Parcels 3 and 4, Psu 2031, comprising Fort Bonifacio, including the so-called Inner Fort comprising of Barangays Pembo, Comembo, Cembo, South Cembo, West Rembo, East Rembo and Pitogo.”
The Philippine Army headquarters, Navy installation, Marines’ headquarters, Consular area, JUSMAG area, Heritage Park, Libingan ng mga Bayani, AFP Officers Village and the so-called six villages are situated in the said areas.
“Considering the historical evidence adduced, cadastral surveys submitted, and the contemporaneous acts of lawful authorities, We find that Taguig presented evidence that is more convincing and worthier of belief than those proffered by Makati,” the SC ruled.
The Makati City government filed a motion for reconsideration.
But the SC denied the motion in a two-page resolution. “Acting on petitioner’s omnibus motion for reconsideration of the decision promulgated on Dec. 1, 2021, which denied the petition for review on certiorari, the Court resolves to deny the motion with finality, the basic issues therein raised having been duly considered and passed upon by the Court in the aforesaid decision,” the resolution stated.
Thereafter, an entry of judgment was issued by the SC which declared final its 2021 decision.

154,PCG prepares for contingency as oil sheen spotted at yacht sinking site near Tubbataha,Aaron Recuenco,"May 1, 2023 ","The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) has started preparing for contingency measures after its personnel spotted oil sheen near the area off the waters of Tubbataha in Palawan where a dive yacht sank on Sunday morning, April 30.
PCG spokesperson Rear Admiral Armand Balilo said they are continuously monitoring the situation in the area where the M/Y Dream Keeper sank in order to come up with an appropriate response.
“We monitored oil sheen near the site where the yacht sank. That’s why our oil spill response team is already there and we are preparing in case there’s an oil spill so that we will be able to contain it right away,” said Balilo. 
He said the oil sheen was spotted some four nautical miles from the Tubbataha Reefs which is popular for pristine coral reefs with a perpendicular wall, extensive lagoons and two coral islands. 
The yacht departed from San Remigio, Cebu City on April 27 and arrived at the Tubbataha Reef around 10 p.m. of April 29. 
The yacht has a total of 32 people on board, 28 of them were already rescued while four others are still missing.
Balilo said the initial investigation revealed that the yacht encountered a squall, or a localized thunderstorm which is now being eyed as the reason behind its sinking.
“The search and rescue operation for the missing is ongoing and those rescued are already safe. Aside from our personnel, there are divers from at least 10 yachts who are helping us in the search and rescue,” said Balilo.
Meanwhile, Balilo said they have already terminated the search and rescue for the two missing crew of a dredger and an oil tanker off the waters of Corregidor Island. 
At least three people were confirmed dead during the sea mishap and Balilo said the search and rescue were already terminated after their divers were not able to locate the two missing crew despite intensive search.

PNP chief information officer Col. Redrico Maranan said the move is a strategic action plan as the national police does not have enough manpower to guard over 100 million Filipinos in all parts of the country.
“The identification of crime-prone barangays is necessary for our deployment. These are the areas where our personnel would be deployed and our commanders were already advised to properly implement it and conduct supervision so that these are done properly,” said Maranan.
The end goal, according to Maranan, is to reduce the crime that eventually leads to the peace of mind of the people.
He explained that police visibility is a necessary tool on this move as police presence has been proven as a crime-deterrent over the years. 
Another action plan that would be initiated by the new PNP chief, according to Maranan, is to ensure that all the complaints of the people are properly addressed and acted in the soonest possible time.
Maranan, however, emphasized the importance of the cooperation of the barangay officials in maintaining peace and order. 
He said that the strong coordination between the police and the community lies in the cooperation between the two, adding that it is the police commanders who are given the task to initiate it. 
“The PNP cannot deploy policemen in each of the barangay. What we do is to cluster the barangay and then we either put up Police Community Precincts, police assistance desks or even a police outpost,” said Maranan.
“We believe that if this is properly implemented, we would be able to reduce the crime especially in the crime-prone barangays,” he added.

156,"Group backs local production of e-vehicles, incentives for e-motorcycles",Aaron Recuenco,"May 1, 2023 ","The calls for the inclusion of electric motorcycles in the government’s tax breaks got another supporter after a group of electric vehicle advocate said it backs giving incentives for e-motorcycles along with their localized production in the future.
Edmund Araga, president of the Electric Vehicle Association of the Philippines (EVAP), said providing incentives to e-motorcycles is welcome as it will help with the electrification of transport in the country.
""It will be welcome on our part if e-motorycles would be given exception because as of now, there is no legitimate local production in the country for e-motorcycles. This would be a good opportunity if the inclusion of e-motorcycles would be puhsed,” said Araga.
“If there would be importation, there should be a direction or directives for a localization in a number of years after importing the units in order to ensure local job creation that would enhance Filipino craftsmanship and skills,” he added.
Araga’s statement came after the Department of Trade and Industry said their group requested to retain the tariff for e-jeepneys and e-tricycles.
He affirmed their request but noted that e-motorcycles were not included in their request to retain the tariff as there are no local producers of them yet.
The Philippine government in January released Executive Order (EO) No. 12 series of 2023 which gives EVs and their components tax breaks for the next five years with the exclusion of e-motorcycles as they are still subject to a 30 percent tariff rate.
Araga said that he also supports this move as motorcycles are the primary choice of transport among Filipinos as they are relatively more affordable than four-wheeled vehicles.
According to the Statista Research Department, there are around 7.81 million registered motorcycles and tricycles, compared to the 1.27 million registered private cars in the country as of 2022.
Several prominent figures of the transport industry in the country also aired their support to give tax breaks to e-motorcycles like Stratbase ADR Institute President Dindo Manhit who said that e-motorcycles' exclusion in the tax breaks is 'unjustified.'
Mobility advocate and Electric Kick Scooter of the Philippines President Tim Vargas also shares the same sentiments, noting that e-motorcycles' introduction will create a new emerging market.
The Philippine Business for Environmental Stewardship also backs the revision of the EO, noting that it should be inclusive to help complement the rising fuel prices.
EO12 will have a review and possible amendments by February 2024 led by the National Economic Development Authority.

According to Romualdez, this would be one of the key discussion points in his upcoming meeting with US President Joe Biden.
 
“The House of Representatives stands solidly behind President Marcos in his effort to further bolster the long-standing relationship between the Philippines and the United States with the end in view of ensuring peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region,” said Romualdez.
 
The House leader is part of the Philippine contingent that welcomed President Marcos on his arrival to the United States at Joint Base Andrews airport in Maryland.  He flew to the US in mid-April to lay the groundwork for Marcos’ visit by meeting with key US lawmakers to discuss further strengthening the security alliance and economic partnership between the two countries.

The President added that in his meeting with Biden, he will explain that the principal interest of the Philippines is to preserve regional peace. 
 
“Geopolitical tensions and apprehensions of possible hostilities in the region will have an adverse effect on our aspirations for sustained economic growth and prosperity,” Romualdez said.
 
“It is to everyone’s benefit to ensure that conflicts are resolved through diplomatic and peaceful means,” he added.
 
Recently, China has been flexing its military might in the region and even expressed alarm over the Philippine government’s grant of US access to four additional military bases under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA).
 
But the Presidentassured Beijing that the additional EDCA sites do not constitute a threat to China, which has a territorial dispute with the Philippines and other countries in the region over maritime claims especially in the West Philippine Sea. 
 
“We work for peace. We will not encourage any provocative action by any country that will involve the Philippines by any other country. We will not allow that to happen. We will not allow the Philippines to be used as a staging post for any kind of military action,” Marcos said during the interview.
 
The Chief Executive also disclosed the Philippines has taken the first steps to establish a high-level communication line with China to prevent a repetition of incidents, such as the recent near collision between coast guard vessels of the Philippines and China in Ayungin Shoal.
 
“We hope that such high-level communication lines can be established the soonest possible time as it would go a long way to avoid any unfortunate incidents in the West Philippine Sea,” Romualdez said. 
 
“Malacanang’s timely action signifies our sincerity to resolve any dispute peacefully, consistent with the President’s foreign policy of being a friend to all and enemy to none,” he also stressed.

165,Bong Go urges DOTr to help LTO resolve license plates shortage,Hannah Torregoza,"May 1, 2023 ","Senator Christopher “Bong” Go has called on the Department of Transportation (DOTr) to help the Land Transportation Office (LTO) address the shortage in plastic driver’s license plates. 
 
Go said it is imperative for the government to have a timely and holistic solution to reduce the impact on motorists who are already facing various challenges.
 
“Kawawa naman po ang mga drivers natin na mahirap. Huwag po sanang mas pahirapan pa. Pagtulungan dapat ng buong gobyerno na masolusyunan ang problemang ito at huwag ipasa ang burden sa mga ordinaryong Pilipino (Please don’t make it harder for our drivers who are already poor. The entire government should work together to solve this problem and not pass the burden on to ordinary Filipinos),” Go said in a statement.
 
Go said he is concerned over the potential inconveniences of issuing paper-based temporary licenses, as vehicle owners would eventually need to visit the LTO offices again to have them replaced.
 
The senator recalled how the Duterte administration made efforts to extend the validity of driver’s licenses to reduce the frequency of visits to government offices.
 
“Kaya nga po noong panahon ni dating pangulong (Rodrigo) Duterte, ginawang five years na po ang validity ng ating (driver’s license) card at kapag wala kang violation ay maaaring maging ten years po ito (That's why during the time of former president (Rodrigo) Duterte, the validity of our (driver's license) card was made five years and if you don't have a violation, it can be ten years),” said Go.
 
“Ibig sabihin, para hindi na po pabalik-balik ang mga kababayan natin na pumunta ng opisina at pumila doon (That is, so that our compatriots will not have to go back and forth to the office and stand in line there),” he said.
 
He said it is important for the DOTr and its attached offices and agencies to provide more efficient public service, especially in support of drivers who may already be facing financial challenges in their line of work.
 
Go recalled LTO chief Jose Arturo Tugade has stated that plans to acquire plastic cards had been in place since December of the preceding year. 
 
But according to Tugade, the DOTr Special Order No. 2023-024 issued on January 25 this year, hindered the LTO from making the purchase, as the directive mandated consolidation of procurement processes across all its agencies for transactions over P50-million. 
 
Still, he said it is important to pursue a unified approach among all the involved agencies, encouraging them to actively collaborate to find a comprehensive and effective solution to the ongoing shortage of plastic driver’s license cards.
 
“Alam n'yo, tayong mga nasa gobyerno, unahin po natin ang comfort at convenience ng bawat Pilipino. Huwag pong pahirapan. Dapat po na-anticipate na kung magkakaroon po ng shortage ng supply ng card (You know, those of us in the government should prioritize the comfort and convenience of every Filipino. Don't make it hard for them. It should have been anticipated if there will be a shortage of card supply),” said Go.
 
“Eh, nagbabayad naman po ang Pilipino. Bakit bibigyan ng papel? Bakit papahirapan? Gawan po dapat ng paraan (Well, Filipinos pay. Why give paper? Why make it hard? There must be a way,"" he emphasized.

169,Marcos sees no need for face mask mandate; COVID incidence still within control,Betheena Unite,"May 1, 2023 ","WASHINGTON, DC, USA—Instead of reimposing the face mask mandate, vaccination among young people should be prioritized again, President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. said.
This was Marcos his reply when asked if he is keen on ordering the return of the mandatory face mask policy in response to the rising cases of Covid-19 in the country.

Marcos will also bring up the two countries' mutual defense treaty, which, according to him, needs to evolve amid the various changes in the region.
Aside from his meeting with Biden, the President will also meet with US legislators, major companies, and business organizations.
Marcos arrived in Washington aboard the presidential flight (PR001). It is his second time in the US as a head of state, following his visit to New York for the United Nations General Assembly last year.

171,PH not staging post for military action —Marcos,Betheena Unite,"May 1, 2023 ","WASHINGTON, USA—President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. said he will ""not allow the Philippines to be used as a staging post for any kind of military action.""
Marcos stated this when he was asked about how he sees the country's role in the Indo-Pacific amid the ongoing geopolitical tensions in the region.
""Simple lang ang goal natin sa Pilipinas (Our goal in the Philippines is simple), we work for peace. We’ll not encourage any provocative action by any country that will involve the Philippines by any other country,"" Marcos said in an interview enroute to Washington on April 30.
""We will not allow that to happen. We will not allow the Philippines to be used as a staging post for any kind of military action,"" he added.
The President stressed that his main concern is the peace and safety of Filipinos in the Philippines and abroad.
He said it is the country's main consideration and its role in the region.
He also pointed out that if the Philippines' goal is to maintain the safety of its people, the ""best role"" that it can play in the region is to lower the tensions in Indo-Pacific.
""And I think the best move for us is to stay within ASEAN, keep ASEAN solid, strong, and united. So that, if that’s the case, if we are— at least, we have a consensus and areas of agreement then it will remain strong and that will be— that ASEAN will still be the one to conduct and to lead the political fortunes of all the other countries around Asia,"" Marcos said.
Meanwhile, in his visit to the United States, the chief executive aims to make the country's position clear in the region.
He will discuss with US President Joe Biden that the Mutual Defense Treaty between the Philippines and US needs to evolve, considering the various changes in the region.
""As we all know, I always talk about (the need for) evolving that relationship and that just means what is their view of the situation in the Indo-Pacific region, how do they feel it will develop and what part today the United States intend to play,"" Marcos said when asked about his top priority during his US visit.
""And again, to put our position forward, and to say that it— kami wala kaming interes kung hindi maging peaceful lang ang region namin (we have no interest other than  attaining peace in our region),"" Marcos added.
He will further stress during the meeting with Biden that the Philippines has no interest in expanding its territory.
""And so we’ll just, I suppose, put our positions, make our positions clear to everybody for both sides para naman (so that) we know how to proceed because then again, we’ll talk about the technical aspects of that,"" he said.
Talking about the Mutual Defense Treaty, Marcos said he will bring this up with Biden ""because the conditions are changing.""
""The conditions under which the Mutual Defense Treaty was written, the original one, are completely different from the conditions that we have, we’re facing now,"" he said.
""China, of course, has become a very dominant in the region. The United States has become less so. And so—but then the other player,  like ASEAN Member States, all the Asian states have also changed their position in the world,"" he added.
He said evolution is needed ""because we have to be able to respond to the situation as it happens.""

172,PBBM hints at new Cabinet members after one-year ban on losing candidates,Betheena Unite,"May 1, 2023 ","President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. has hinted about tapping politicians who lost in the 2022 elections to join his administration after the expiry of the one-year ban.
Although he did not mention any name of prospects, Marcos said he will have to look at it and he will definitely appoint some of them to his Cabinet.
He stated that many of those who ran for certain government positions in the past election are capable and are willing to work for the government.
""Marami namang magaling na hindi nanalo sa eleksyon na gustong tumulong. So we will  certainly look into that in different positions (There are many good candidates who did not win the election but really wanted to help),"" Marcos said.
""Pero (But) yeah. More or less, for the beginning of the second year of my term, palagay ko mayroong mga ano (I think there will be). Not a shuffle but we will add people to the Cabinet, to strengthen the Cabinet,"" Marcos added.
He said he will not announce it to anybody and that they should not hear from the press first.
""They should hear it from me. Kami muna mag-usap (We will talk first),"" he added.
Almost a year after assuming presidency, the President has yet to appoint a full-fledged secretaries for the Departments of Agriculture, Health, and National Defense.
There is a one-year ban implemented for politicians who lost during the previous elections to avoid conflict of interests or allegations of impropriety in the selection of government officials.

173,"DHSUD, party-list group commit to housing projects for OFWs",Aaron Recuenco,"May 1, 2023 ","The Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (DHSUD) has signed an agreement with a party-list group for a collaboration in the housing program for overseas Filipino workers (OFWs).
Under the agreement, OFW Partylist Rep. Marissa Magsino would push for legislative measures for the allocation of funds for the housing projects for the OFWs, a commitment welcomed by DHSUD Secretary Jose Rizalino Acuzar as he noted the need for more funds for the projects.
Having an ally in the House of Representatives, like Congresswoman Marissa, will definitely boost DHSUD’s efforts to get the much-needed budgetary push to pursue the national housing,” said Acuzar.
The agreement was signed between Acuzar and Magsino on Sunday, April 30.
The DHSUD is currently at the height of rolling out the housing program aimed at building one million housing units every year until 2028 to address the country’s housing backlog pegged at more than 6.5 million units.
“For some, this is very ambitious, if not impossible. But for us, we take inspiration from these occasions when we seal partnerships with stakeholders, knowing we have your support,” said Acuzar 
To date, DHSUD has partnered with more than 130 local government units nationwide to implement the “Pambansang Pabahay”.

175,Robin flies to Israel for conferences on medical marijuana,Mario Casayuran,"May 1, 2023 ","Senator Robinhood ""Robin"" C. Padilla flew to Israel Saturday night to attend a series of conferences on the compassionate use of medical cannabis (marijuana) - and how to apply Israel's experience to the Philippines.

Other seminars are expected to touch on agricultural technologies and development in medical cannabis, as well as research and development.
In pushing for legalizing the compassionate use of medical cannabis, Padilla noted last year that many Filipinos - including children - continue to suffer from the effects of medical conditions such as seizure disorders and epilepsy, which may be addressed by medical cannabis.
On the other hand, he said there are many potential economic benefits from the non-psychoactive parts of plants from the marijuana species.
These are for making more than 25,000 items such as paper, money, rope, cloth and even biofuel, laundry detergent, automobile construction parts, beauty products, hemp protein powders, hemp milk, hemp coffee and milk, particle board biodegradable plastic, paint and insulation, he pointed out.

180,Here are 3 of Kabayan solon's pro-Pinoy workers bills,Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 30, 2023 ","A ranking congressman highlighted on the eve of Labor Day three of his longstanding proposals that aim to provide Filipino workers with a decent life.
""As we celebrate Labor Day this May 1, we recognize the indispensable role of labor as the backbone of our economy and society, and thus, we stand with our Filipino workers in the fight for fair and just working conditions,” Kabayan Party-list Rep. Ron Salo said in a statement on Sunday night, April 30.
Salo chairs the House Committee on Overseas Workers Affairs in the current 19th Congress.
“Consistent with one of the core advocacies of Kabayan Party-list which is livelihood, we have filed three bills, among many other bills, that aim to ensure decent life for our workers,” said the lawyer-congressman.
""First, we need to address the issue of low wages. No worker should have to live in poverty because of a very low minimum wage. That's why I am advocating for the passage of HB (House Billl) No.525 or our Minimum Wage bill which seeks to adjust the minimum wage to P750 nationwide, that will allow workers to live decently,"" Salo noted.
""Second, we must recognize the hard work and dedication of our workers by providing them with a 14th month pay. This will not only boost their morale but also provide them with additional funds to cover their needs,"" he said.
""In this regard we have filed HB No.520, mandating a 14th month pay for all workers, whether in the government or in the private sector and regardless of the status of their employment,"" he said.
Finally, Salo highlighted the importance of providing automatic civil service eligibility to government contract workers and job orders by filing HB No.521.
""These workers have been serving our country for years, and they deserve to be given the chance to become permanent government employees after a certain number of years. This will not only benefit them but also our government, as it ensures a stable and efficient workforce,"" he explained.
Salo's bills, which he has been pushing for since the 17th Congress, have gained significant support from fellow lawmakers and various labor groups who recognize the urgency of improving the situation of Filipino workers.
""Our workers deserve nothing but the best. Let us continue to work together to uplift their lives and provide them with the support and protection they need and deserve,"" Salo concluded.

181,Public told: Keep transactions with online sellers within e-commerce platforms,Charie Mae F. Abarca,"Apr 30, 2023 ","The Department of Information and Communications Technology’s Cybersecurity Bureau advised Filipinos to only transact with online sellers within legitimate e-commerce platforms or online stores to ensure their safety.
This, according to DICT, was after they received reports and complaints where consumers got scammed after they were given “external links” to transact with sellers.
“[B]uyers are given external means, such as Viber and Messenger, for contacting and transacting with the seller,” said DICT, adding that once these buyers have paid, the seller will immediately be out of reach while the ordered items remain undelivered.
“[We are advising] the general public to keep their transactions with online sellers within e-commerce platforms. This is so as any issues or concerns regarding online sellers may be brought up and addressed accordingly,” DICT furthered.
The government agency also explained that difficulties with transactions done outside legitimate e-commerce platforms will be difficult to address. Meanwhile, online sellers were instructed to develop tighter security mechanisms within their platforms to prevent risks of fraud.

183,"DepEd’s revised curriculum ‘dilutes nationalism’ in foundational grades, group says",Merlina Hernando-Malipot,"Apr 30, 2023 ","A group of education workers expressed concern about the new curriculum for Kinder to Grade 10 noting that it will essentially weaken the sense of nationalism among learners in the primary years of schooling.
“ACT agrees that the development of foundational literacy skills should be ensured in the primary grades,” the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) said.
However, the group pointed out that with proposed changes in the K to 10 curriculum, particularly from Kinder to Grade 3, the instilling of nationalism among young learners might be compromised.
ACT observed that the revised curriculum abolishes the Mother Tongue as a subject, merges Social Studies with Music-Arts-Physical Education-Health (MAPEH), and teaches English as a subject at an earlier time, from its current introduction in the third quarter to the first quarter of Grade 1.
“The proposed abolition of the Mother Tongue as a subject runs counter to this objective,” ACT Chairperson Vladimer Quetua said. He noted that the teaching of the Mother Tongue as a subject is ""foundational in developing literacy skills as learners can learn to read and write the easiest with the language that they use and most understand.”
He added that Mother Tongue also “enhances the awareness and appreciation of learners of their cultural identity, and preserves and nurtures our own culture.”
With the proposed abolition of Mother Tongue as a subject, Quetua pointed out that the merging of Araling Panlipunan (Social Studies) with MAPEH into Sibika, Sining at Kultura, Kasaysayan at Kagalingang Pangkatawan (SiKaP) “effectively cuts down teaching time for a very diverse set of subject areas that are essential in developing national and cultural identity, critical thinking, nationalism, as well as a healthy lifestyle.”
Quetua noted that giving “ample time to teaching social studies and MAPEH should not be seen as a hindrance, but as additional areas that can help develop reading, writing and arithmetic skills.”
On the other hand, Quetua said that the English language will be introduced at an earlier time.
Early in his term, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr. Marcos he wants English to be taught in the earliest grades for Filipinos to “maintain their advantage as English-speaking people.”
For ACT, this step “messes up with the logical transitory framework of Mother Tongue as the first language, Filipino as the second language, and English as the third language in learning.”
Quetua alleged that the “real agenda behind this is not really for our learners to have a mastery of the vital lessons that hey have to learn, but to make them marketable to foreign employers.”
Meanwhile, Quetua pointed out that DepEd’s proposed revisions to the K to 12 curriculum “seem to veer education further away from addressing the learning crisis and correcting the problems” of the original K to 12 curriculum which have long “diluted the inculcation of nationalism with the abolition of the Philippine History subject in junior high school, and watering down of the contents of Araling Panlipunan and Filipino subjects.”
While ACT supported the decluttering of the current curriculum for it to enable learners to master foundational literacy skills, ACT said that this should be done by the curriculum prioritizing the “must-have” than the “nice-to-have” competencies.
“Mother Tongue should continue to be taught as a subject and the DepEd should rectify its errors in the problematic implementation of the Mother Tongue program,” Quetua said.
He added that all subject areas should be designed to incorporate the development of literacy skills. “More importantly, subjects that engrain nationalism and promotes national identity and culture should not be sacrificed to favor the English language,” Quetua said.
Moreover, ACT said that Philippine History as a dedicated subject in high school should be “restored” and the contents of Araling Panlipunan and Filipino subjects should be “strengthened.”
DepEd released the curriculum guide for K to 10 last week which is open for comments until May 3.

184,BI to maximize airport operations updates via social media,Jun Ramirez,"Apr 30, 2023 ","The Bureau of Immigration (BI) will step up its airport operations updates to the passengers through the social media.
BI Commissioner Norman Tansingco said they received positive feedback during the Holy Week, when the initiative was launched.
The BI will use its social media platforms to share photos of its operations during weekends and holidays, essentially similar to traffic reports on the roads.
""This will help departing passengers prepare for congestion and ensure they check in at least three hours before their flight,"" the BI chief said.
To view the updates, passengers can visit the BI's Facebook pages at facebook.com/officialbureauofimmigration and facebook.com/immigration.helpline.ph.
Tansingco suggested that passengers planning to use other airport facilities should arrive earlier to allow ample time for departure clearance and leisurely activities.
The BI will also deploy additional 147 immigration officers at airports and offices across the country after their training at the Philippine Immigration Academy.
"
185,BI vows to enhance skills of its frontliners,Jun Ramirez,"Apr 30, 2023 ","The Bureau of Immigration (BI) will enhance the soft skills of frontliners through specialized training for their duties at airports and seaports.
This came after the release of a report by the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), which highlights the lack of job readiness and soft skills among recent graduates.
The reason, according to the report, was due to the implementation of K-12 and online classes during the pandemic.
Apart from the standard immigration training, which emphasizes immigration laws and procedures, the BI will introduce a values module.
The new module aims to promote courtesy and empathy among government employees, and it includes courses on moral values, leadership, management, and team building for new immigration officers.
This new module reinforces the core values of patriotism, professionalism, and integrity for new officers.

187,A first: House sets aside P10B to implement solar-powered water supply system nationwide,Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 30, 2023 ","Ako Bicol Party-list's solar-powered water supply system program will be implemented nationwide to the tune of P10 billion, House Committee on Appropriations Chairman Zaldy Co bared in statement Sunday, April 30.
""As the chairman of the appropriations [panel] in Congress and with the concurrence of the Speaker [Martin Romualdez], we have approved the allocation of P10 billion for the implementation of solar-powered water supply systems throughout the entire country,"" said Co, an Ako Bicol nominee in the House of Representatives.
""This is the first time that Congress has allocated funds for the implementation of solar-powered water supply systems throughout the Philippines,"" noted the second-term congressman.
The solar-powered water supply system uses solar energy to provide a cost-effective and sustainable potable water supply to upland communities without access to services of water concessionaires.
Ako Bicol has been busy expanding the program in Bicol the past few months ahead of the expected effects of El Niño or the extended dry season.
The party-list said that the initiative to fund the program's nationwide implementation marks a significant milestone of the House under Speaker Romualdez and President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos toward promoting sustainable water supply solutions.
The solar-powered water supply system's built-in filtration provides cleaner water compared to traditional systems relying on non-renewable sources. The water produced by the system is safe for drinking, unlike that provided by water concessionaires.
In addition to providing sustainable and affordable water supply solutions, the solar-powered water supply system also ensures that beneficiaries can maintain the system at a minimal cost.
They only need to pay P20 per family per month for the maintenance of the filter system, significantly lower than the minimum monthly payment of P200 for water concessionaires service.
This makes the initiative more accessible to underserved communities in need of clean water, but cannot afford the high costs of traditional water supply systems, Co said.
Ako Bicol Party-list first implemented the potable water supply program in Bicol three years ago.

188,7 NPA rebels dead in N. Samar clash – military,Martin Sadongdong,"Apr 30, 2023 ","Seven suspected New People’s Army (NPA) rebels died in an armed encounter with government forces in Bobon, Northern Samar on Sunday, April 30, the military said.
 

(File photo via Manila Bulletin)
Elements of the Philippine Army’s 803rd Infantry Brigade, 8th Infantry Division (8ID) were conducting joint focused operations with the Philippine National Police (PNP) in the hinterlands of Barangay Santander when they encountered around 40 armed men.
The armed men are believed to be members of the NPA Sub-Regional Guerilla Unit (SRGU) and remnants of the dismantled Front Committee-2 (FC-2), Sub-Regional Committee (SRC) Emporium of the Eastern Visayas Regional Party Committee (EVRPC), according to Captain Jefferson Mariano, chief of the 8ID public affairs office. 
The armed men, Mariano said, were led by a certain Mario Sevillano alias Durok. 
“The joint operation was conducted following the information given by concerned civilians that a group of armed men were seen passing thru the outskirts of said barangay,” Mariano said.
The 8ID then deployed troops and coordinated with the police to track the armed men but a gunfight suddenly erupted when the two parties met.
Mariano said the area was a “terrorist hideout” which was “heavily fortified and surrounded by prohibited anti-personnel mines (APMs).” This prompted the troops to call for close air and artillery support.
After the initial firefight and the enemies withdrew, Mariano said the troops found the cadavers of the seven suspected rebels during clearing operations. The names of the casualties have yet to be disclosed by the military.
The troops also recovered an R4 rifle, two M16 rifles, one AK47 rifle, one anti-personnel mine, and several “subversive” documents. 
“Clearing efforts is still ongoing as of this reporting and troops on the ground [have] seen heavy bloodstain along their route of withdrawal which indicates that the CNTs [communist NPA terrorists] suffered heavy casualty,” Mariano said.
According to Mariano,  the NPA SRGU and FC-2, SRC Emporium of EVRPC are “notorious for numerous atrocities” in Northern Samar, tagging them as the perpetrators behind several ambuscades, extortions, and killings in the province.
“One of which is the attack of two unarmed CAFGU Active Auxillary (CAA) in San Isidro, Northern Samar last August 2021. Likewise, multiple warrants of arrest for murder and attempted murder was filed for their inhumane activities,” he said.
Two CAA identified as Lito Dauba, 39, and Arcito Reyes, 46, were killed by suspected NPA rebels in San Isidro, Northern Samar on Aug. 21, 2021. 
The unarmed militiamen were shot at close range while they were on their way to join a development social work for the villagers.

189,Aussie envoy urges China: Follow UNCLOS; stop SCS incursions,Raymund Antonio,"Apr 30, 2023 ","Australia called for “peace, stability and respect” for the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) following the incessant incursions being made by China in disputed areas of the South China Sea.
Australian Ambassador to the Philippines Hae Kyong Yu made the call in a Twitter post after she expressed concern over what she said China’s “unprofessional and dangerous conduct” against the Philippines.
She cited a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) report that said it spotted more than 100 Chinese vessels, including a warship and coast guard ships, during its maritime patrols in the West Philippine Sea from April 18 to 24.
According to the PCG, the BRP Malapascua and BRP Malabrigo counted over 100 Chinese Maritime Militia (CMM) vessels, People’s Liberation Army Navy corvette, and two China Coast Guard (CGG) vessels.
“The PCG has already submitted a report to the National Task Force West Philippine Sea (NTFWPS), highlighting the presence of a Chinese warship, the continued appearance of alleged CMM vessels within the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), as well as the aggressive actions of the CCG against PCG vessels,” PCG spokesman Commodore Jay Tarriela said in a statement.
He gave an update on its patrol almost a week after one of the two ships engaged in a near-collision with a Chinese coast guard vessel in the vicinity of Ayungin Shoal, which is within the Philippine’s EEZ.
“Australia reiterates our call for peace, stability and respect for UNCLOS in the South China Sea, a vital international waterway,” Yu’s post said.
China, in 2009, submitted to the United Nations (UN) its “nine-dash line” claim that covers the entire South China Sea, including parts of the Philippines’ western seaboard from the provinces of Ilocos Norte up to Palawan.
China’s claim, however, has been repeatedly called invalid and not in accordance with UNCLOS, which the Philippines ratified in 1986 and China in 1996. The Permanent Court of Arbitration upheld in July 2016 the Philippines' position and debunked China' so-called nine-dash line concept.

The members of the Inter-Agency panel will be the Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior and Local Government, the Department of National Defense, the Department of Trade and Industry, the National Security Council, and the Philippine National Police.
“When necessary, the Inter-Agency Committee may request the attendance or participation of other relevant agencies, such as the Civil Service Commission and the Commission of Human Rights,” the EO stated.
The Inter-Agency Committee shall consolidate and evaluate all comprehensive reports, which contain findings and recommendations by concerned agencies to be submitted to the President. It is also tasked to develop a roadmap containing the priority areas of action, tangible deliverables, clear responsibilities, and appropriate timeframes, consistent with the recommendations of the HLTM.
“The roadmap shall be subject to regular review and should consider the consolidated reports and recommendations from the concerned agencies and inputs from other relevant stakeholders,” the EO stated.
“Each of the concerned agencies shall designate a focal unit or office within the agency, to be headed by an official with a rank not lower than that of an Undersecretary, which shall monitor, evaluate and report on the implementation and progress of agency action plans, initiatives relating to freedom of association and rights to organize and to collective bargaining.” it furthered.

192,"Provide perks to ‘qualified’ senior citizens, DILG urges CAR LGUs",Chito Chavez,"Apr 30, 2023 ","The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) called out the local government units (LGUs) to appropriately carry out the delivery of grants and privileges of the qualified senior citizens in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR).
In a statement, the DILG-CAR reminded the LGUs that this is “mandated by law in a bid to provide full support for their overall well-being and full participation in society.’’
""We are urging that our LGUs ensure that senior citizens' rights and privileges are protected and fully fulfilled. This is to ensure their well-being and full participation in society,” DILG-CAR Director Araceli San Jose reiterated.
""Let us be the answer to the hopes of millions of senior citizens who have been clamoring for a more effective implementation of several laws and programs addressing the needs of the elderly. These measures will motivate and encourage our senior citizens to contribute to nation-building while also improving their lives,” she added.
Senior Citizens’ Privileges
Republic Act (RA) 7432 otherwise known as ""The Senior Citizens Act,"" which was amended by RA 9257 and 9994 (Expanded Senior Citizens Act) states that it is the government's responsibility to provide the senior citizens with employment, education, health, public service, housing, public transport, and other assistance such as social pension and Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) coverage assistance.

Hence, they just need to present any of the following identification cards (ID) from the Office of the Senior Citizens Affairs (OSCA), passport and other pertinent documents showing that the concerned person is 60 years old or over.
In addition to the barangay certificate, leasing agreement, proof of billing and valid government ID, LGUs are not required to request proof of residency from senior citizens.
“The department will also like to remind our LGUs to give senior citizens with free health, dental, and laboratory medical services in public hospitals and comparable facilities, in accordance with DOH and PhilHealth laws, whenever the need arises,” San Jose explained.
Educational Assistance
The government may also provide educational help for post-secondary, tertiary, post tertiary education, vocational or short courses to older adults who seek to continue their studies through scholarships, grants, subsidies, and other incentives.
The incentives include aid with the purchase of books, educational supplies, and school clothes, provided that the students pass their chosen courses and shall meet minimum admission requirements.
Likewise, the LGUs are encouraged to provide senior citizens with express lanes at private and public institutions or give them priority if such lanes are unavailable.

196,Cong Duterte proposes tweaks to NLRC to make it more effective in resolving labor cases,Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 30, 2023 ","Davao City 1st district Rep. Paolo Duterte is highlighting ahead of Labor Day a measure seeking to create an additional division in the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in a bid to further improve the body’s accomplishment rate in resolving labor-related disputes.
Duterte filed for this purpose House Bill (HB) No.4958, which proposes to increase the NLRC divisions from eight to nine, with the additional division to be located in Davao to handle cases in Mindanao.
As provided under the Labor Code, the NLRC’s first to sixth divisions are located in Metro Manila. The seventh is based in Cebu in the Visayas, while the the eighth in Cagayan de Oro in Mindanao.
The bill, co-authored by Benguet lone district Rep. Eric Go Yap, also provides for the addition of three NLRC commissioners, bringing the total number of  the commission’s members to 27, including the chairperson of the body.
These changes are sought “in support of its (NLRC) mission to resolve labor disputes in the fairest, quickest, least expensive and most effective way possible"".
The NLRC is a quasi-judicial body attached to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). It is mandated to decide on labor and management disputes through compulsory arbitration and alternative modes of dispute resolution.
According to its 2021 performance report, the NLRC maintained a high disposition rate and significantly reduced the number of its pending cases.
The commission posted an overall output of 32,433 cases for compulsory arbitration of which 24,262 are original cases from the Regional Arbitration Branches  (RABs) and 8,171 are appealed cases from the Commission Proper.
Of the NLRC’s 98 percent overall target,  the RABs and the commission proper were able to dispose of 27,754, which translates into an 86 percent accomplishment rate.
However, on the percentage of cases resolved within three months from the filing or receipt of complaints, the RABs were able to accomplish only 38 percent of its 69 percent target for 2021.
The current eight divisions of the NLRC are composed of three members each-- the presiding commissioner  comes from  the government sector, while the two other members represent the workers’ and employers’ sectors.

197,PNP senior officers up for promotion need to be cleared first from drug link evaluations,Aaron Recuenco,"Apr 30, 2023 ","Senior officers of the Philippine National Police (PNP) will need a little more time to wait for the approval of their promotion amid the final phase of the assessment and evaluation aimed at purging the organization of officials who may have links with illegal drugs operations.
While the five-man advisory group has already completed its task, its recommendation is still under the review of the National Police Commission and will eventually be submitted to the Office of the President for action.
PNP chief information officer Col. Redrico Maranan said the entire process of assessment and evaluation has to be completed first to determine who among the third level officers, from colonel to general, are cleared.
“The processing of the promotions of third level officers is continuous, there’s just a need to clear those who are for promotion,” said Maranan.
“Once it is submitted to the President, then the promotions of third level officers will continue,” he added.
Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos, who asked the third level officers to submit a courtesy resignation over the resurgence of allegations of involvement of cops in illegal drugs trade, earlier said that 917 senior officers were already cleared.
On the other hand, at least 36 senior police officers are still subjected to further assessment and evaluation of Napolcom.
Once the courtesy resignation of any senior PNP officer is accepted, the rule is that he or she would be forced to retire from the service.
“So, the promotion is temporarily on hold until such time that those who would be promoted are cleared of the alleted link to illegal drugs activities,” said Maranan.

Wilbert T. Lee is asking the government to stay the course with its decision to invest heavily in both sectors.
""Maraming kailangang gawin upang maayos ang agrikultura (A lot of things need to be done to fix the agriculture sector). But all these measures point to one thing—that the government needs to continue investing heavily to make the sector vibrant,"" Lee said in a statement Sunday, April 30.
""With improved agriculture, we also improve the livelihood of our farmers and other producers and help them escape the cycle of poverty,"" underscored the neophyte solon.

Lee noted that urgent action is needed to help farmers and fisherfolks have a better quality of life.
On top of this, the Bicol congessman said the challenge remains for the government to revitalize agriculture through modernization, which would shift employment toward higher-value jobs like equipment operators and others that utilize technology.
""We have to show that we are undertaking serious and sincere efforts to improve agriculture, so that the youth will not see it as a 'dead-end job',"" Lee said.
""Kailangan nating pakatandaan na nakakabit ang pag-unlad ng bansa sa agrikultura (We should always remeber that a nation's progress is tied to its agriculture),"" further said.

Rear Adm. Armando Balilo, PCG spokesperson, said the fatality was recovered during the conduct of diving operations at 6:27 p.m. on Saturday, April 29. 
“Kahapon may narecover pa tayong isa doon sa diving operations (Yesterday, we recovered another body during the diving operations),” Balilo said in a radio interview with dzBB on Sunday, April 30.
The identity of the latest fatality has yet to be revealed in public.
But the PCG said that the fatality was among the three previously reported missing crew members of MV Hong Hai 189, which sank after colliding with MT Petite Soeur last April 28.

200,"Marcos eyes stronger PH-US ties in Washington, DC visit",Argyll Cyrus Geducos,"Apr 30, 2023 ","President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. described his five-day working visit to Washington DC, USA, as crucial as this allows him to further reinforce the Philippines' already strong bonds with the United States.
######

Marcos said this as he departed for a two-country swing, starting with an Official Visit to Washington DC, before heading to London for the coronation of King Charles III.
In his pre-departure speech, the President said his US visit, especially his meeting with President Joseph Biden, was essential to advancing the Philippines' national interests and strengthening the ""very important"" Philippine-US alliance.
""During this visit, we will reaffirm our commitment to fostering our long-standing alliance as an instrument of peace and as a catalyst of development in the Asia-Pacific region and, for that matter, the rest of the world,"" he said.
Marcos said he would tell Biden that he was determined to forge an ever more vital relationship with the United States in a wide range of areas such as food security, agricultural productivity development, digital economy, energy security, climate change, and cybersecurity.
He added that his bilateral meeting with Biden would allow him to ensure the country's resilience from economic threats, including global supply chain disruptions and economic coercion.
""Towards this end, one of my priorities for this visit is to push for greater economic engagement, particularly through trade and investment, and science, technology, and innovation cooperation, between the United States and the Philippines,"" Marcos said.

Business meetings
According to the Chief Executive, he intends to speak and find opportunities in the semiconductor industry, critical minerals, and renewable and clean energy, including nuclear and infrastructure projects that will improve the Philippines' digital telecommunication systems and facilitate sustainability efforts to address climate change.
Marcos also expects to meet with American business leaders to promote trade and investment in the Philippines further.
In addition, key Filipino private sector leaders would join the trip to explore business opportunities that would grow the Philippine economy even more.
Lastly, President Marcos will meet members of the Filipino community, who, he said, maintain strong ties to the Philippines despite being away for very many years, but continue to contribute towards the country’s economic prosperity.
This would be Marcos' second trip to the United States since his election in 2022. He first went to New York for the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in September last year and for separate meetings with President Biden and American business leaders.
After King Charles III's coronation in the United Kingdom, Marcos will fly to Labuan Bajo, Indonesia, for the 42nd Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit from May 9 to 11.
Vice President Sara Duterte would serve as the country's caretaker while President Marcos is out of the country.

202,"SC on decision-writing period May 2 to June 9; no division, full court sessions",Rey G. Panaligan,"Apr 30, 2023 ","The Supreme Court (SC) starts its five-week recess on May 2 to concentrate on decision writing on pending cases.
With its recess until June 9, the SC will not conduct sessions in its divisions and in the full court unless a very urgent case that needs swift action is filed within the period.
If an urgent case is filed, Chief Justice Alexander G. Gesmundo will call the holding of a special session either in the division or full court.
When Gesmundo assumed the top post in the judiciary in April 2021, he assured the expeditious resolution of cases pending with the SC.  Since then, the SC has been coming out with decisions on cases which had stayed unresolved for the past six or eight years.
The SC had just concluded its summer sessions that started last April 11 in Baguio City.  One of the petitions tackled during the summer sessions was the challenge on the alleged unconstitutionality of the SIM (subscriber identity module) registration under Republic Act No. 11934.
It did not issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) on the petition.  Instead, it merely asked several government agencies and telecommunication firms to comment on the petition within 10 days.
But President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. ordered a 90-day extension on SIM registration that expired last April 26.
Aside from the challenge on the SIM Registration Act, the SC is also expected to study for deliberation after the recess, the petition against the alleged unconstitutionality of the no-contact apprehension policy (NCAP) for traffic violations in several cities in Metro Manila.
On Aug. 30, 2022, the SC issued a TRO that stopped the implementation of NCAP and thereafter conducted oral arguments.  Two petitions were filed against NCAP.
At the time the first petition was filed, the NCAP was being implemented in Metro Manila by the local governments of Quezon City, Manila, Valenzuela City, Muntinlupa City, and Parañaque City through their ordinances based on the 2016 resolution of the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) which ordered the re-implementation of the policy.
Also set for study during the recess is the petition against Republic Act No. 11935 that mandated the postponement of the Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections (BSKE) from Dec. 5, 2022 to Oct. 30, 2023.
Under RA 11935 which was signed into law by President Marcos Jr. last Oct. 10, the BSKE will be held on the last Monday of October 2023 or on Oct. 30, 2023.
The law provides that all incumbent barangay and SK (Sangguniang Kabataan) officials will remain in office until their successors are elected and qualified or unless they are sooner removed or suspended.
Barangay and SK officials, who are ex-officio members of the Sangguniang Bayan, Sangguniang Panlungsod, or Sangguniang Panlalawigan will continue to serve until the next BSKE, unless removed under existing rules, the new law also stated.
The SC had also issued a Writ of Kalikasan that effectively stopped temporarily the government from commercially propagating genetically modified rice and eggplant, known as Golden Rice and BT (Bacillus thuringiensis) eggplant.
The writ was issued last April 18 during the SC’s full court session in Baguio City.
In a resolution, the SC directed the secretaries of the Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and the Department of Health (DOH), the director of the Bureau of Plant Industry, the Philippine Rice Research Institute, and the University of the Philippines in Los Baños in Laguna to file a verified return within 10 days from notice.
The SC acted on the petition for a Writ of Kalikasan filed by several groups led by the Magsasaka at Siyentipiko Para sa Pag-Unlad ng Agrikultura (Masipag).
A Writ of Kalikasan is a legal remedy for the protection of one’s right to “a balanced and healthful environment….”
On election cases, the SC is also expected to study for decision the petition of ousted Albay Gov. Noel E. Rosal who was removed as the province’s governor for alleged violation of Section 261 of the Omnibus Election Code on the 45-day spending ban in the May 9, 2022 elections.
Rosal had told the SC that the Commission on Elections (Comelec) issued the disqualification ruling based on “mere allegations” and despite the failure of the complainant to “adduce evidence” that he had actually disbursed funds during a period specified by the Omnibus Election Code.
He pleaded the SC to respect the manifest will of the electorate of Albay. Rosal got 469,481 votes as against his closest rival’s 238,746 votes or a commanding vote-lead of 230,735 votes, despite a pending disqualification petition during the election.
Rosal asked the SC “to apply the very recent decision of the court in the disqualification case of the mayor of Agoo, La Union where the court resolved all doubts in favor of the manifest will of the people electing the latter as their mayor despite a pending disqualification case.”
He was referring to the very recent SC decision which upheld the election of Frank Ong Sibuma as municipal mayor of Agoo, La Union as it reversed two resolutions issued against him by the Comelec in May and June 2022.

203,Don’t self-medicate vs sore eyes—DOH exec,Analou de Vera,"Apr 30, 2023 ","The public should avoid self-medication if they experience symptoms of sore eyes, an official of the Department of Health (DOH) said.
It is better to get a prescription from a health professional if an individual is suffering from sore eyes, said DOH Health Environment Division Chief Dr. Rosalind Vianzon.
“Of course ang importante diyan, matingnan siya ng isang primary care provider para kung kailangan bigyan siya ng eye ointment or ophthalmic drops---yung tamang prescription ang maibigay sa kanya (the important thing is that the person must be examined by a primary care provider to determine if the individual needs to use an eye ointment or ophthalmic drops. This is  to ensure that the right prescription is given),” said Vianzon in a recent media forum.
“Huwag tayong magpapatak sa sarili o magpapahid ng kung anu-ano kasi baka imbes na makabuti ay lalo pa pong makasama sa ating mga mata (Do not put any eye drops or ointment products in your eyes because this may  tend to do more harm than good),” she added.
Vianzon also advised the public to avoid rubbing the eyes. This will also help minimize the spread of the viral infection to other people as the discharge from sore eyes “are sources of infections.”
“Usually ang sore eyes makati yan, talagang intentionally, unknowingly nai-iscratch yung mata so as much as possible ayun po ang iwasan natin (sore eyes are really itchy and intentionally, unknowingly you tend to scratch your eyes. So as much as possible we should avoid that),” she said.
“Imbes na kamutin o i-scratch yung mata siguro maghilamos nalang para mabawasan yung itchiness nung sore eyes (Instead of scratching the eyes, it is better to wash it to reduce the itchiness of sore eyes),” she added.

This was part of House Minority Leader and 4Ps Party-list Rep. Marcelino “Nonoy” Libanan's message on Sunday, April 30 to President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr., who is set to embark on a five-day official visit to the United States (US).
“We are all counting on the President’s trip to pave the way for additional American direct investment inflows that we need to support our economic recovery and generate new employment,” Libanan said.
The highlight of Marcos' trip stateside is his bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden.
“If we look at the latest surveys, the creation of new jobs remains among the top concerns of Filipinos,” Libanan said.
At present, American multinational corporations in the Philippines are invested mostly in manufacturing, wholesale trade, and professional, scientific, and technical services, including highly labor-intensive business process outsourcing (BPO) activities.
Marcos met Biden for the first time as president during the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York in September last year.

206,Dream vacation turns into nightmare as dive yacht sinks off Palawan,Martin Sadongdong,"Apr 30, 2023 ","A dream trip turned into a nightmare when a dive yacht carrying 32 passengers and crew capsized off Tubbataha, Palawan on Sunday morning, April 30, as search and rescue (SAR) operation was conducted to find four individuals who went missing.
 

(M/Y Dream Keeper / Courtesy of PCG)
The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said that its command center received information from Coast Guard District Palawan at 6:49 a.m. about the sinking of “M/Y Dream Keeper” off Tubbataha, which is home to marine protected area (MPA) Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park.
It was not immediately clear what caused the yacht to sink as investigation was ongoing. The yacht departed from San Remegio, Cebu City around 4 p.m. of April 27 and arrived at Tubbataha Reef around 10 p.m. of April 29.
“Itong Dream Catcher ay nag-accommodate ng turista para magkaroon ng diving experience sa Tubbataha. Pinache-check natin kung anong dahilan bakit lumubog itong kanilang yate sapagkat napakaganda naman ng panahon (This Dream Catcher accommodated tourists so they could have diving experience in Tubbataha. We are checking what caused the yacht to sink because the weather in the area is fine),” Rear Adm. Armando Balilo, PCG spokesperson, said in a radio interview with dzBB.
Balilo said part of the investigation is to determine whether the yacht sank while the tourists were already diving or if they were still on the way to their destination. 
“Wala naman [gale warning] at iyon ang tinitignan natin. Sa ganitong oras, sisikapin natin makuha ‘yong iba pang nawawala para makapunta na tayo sa pagtatanong natin (There was no [gale warning] in the area and that is what we are looking into. Right now, we will do our best to find the missing individuals so we can proceed with our investigation),” he added.
“Hindi pa natin alam ‘yong detalye. Baka mamaya naka-angkla na sila at nagda-dive na. Hindi natin alam. Aalamin natin kung lumubog sila along the way (We don’t know yet the detail [why it capsized]. It might be that the yacht was already anchored and they were already diving. We don’t know. We will determine if they sank along the way),” Balilo stated.
Out of the 32 individuals onboard, 12 are passengers/guests, 15 are crew members, and five are dive masters.
The PCG said that 28 of them, including four Chinese tourists, were already rescued. They were all brought to Coast Guard vessel BRP Teresa Magbanua for a physical checkup before being escorted to Puerto Princesa, Palawan, according to Balilo.
Meanwhile, the remaining four missing individuals are all Filipinos: a dive master, the owner of the yacht, and two passengers. Their names have yet to be disclosed.
Balilo said the PCG also dispatched BRP Melchora Aquino (MRRV-9702) while the Coast Guard Sub-Station Tubbataha augmented other dive boats in the area to find the missing individuals.
The PCG also coordinated with the Palawan-based Western Command (WesCOm) of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) for the deployment of additional floating and aerial assets.

207,"Villanueva: DOLE, NEDA should carefully study proposed wage adjustments for Filipino workers ​",Hannah Torregoza,"Apr 30, 2023 "," 
 
Senate Majority Leader Joel Villanueva on Sunday, April 30 called on the government to thoroughly study the measures that seek to determine the reasonable living wage for the country’s workers.
 
Villanueva made the call ahead of the nation’s Labor Day activities on Monday, May 1. 
 
“We are pushing for a living wage that is based on clear standards (Atin pong itinutulak ang pagkakaroon ng sweldong angkop sa pamumuhay o living wage na nakabatay sa malinaw na pamantayan),”
 
“Mahalaga pong mapag-aralang mabuti ng Department of Labor and Employment at National Economic and Development Authority ang magiging tamang pamantayan para matukoy ang reasonableng living wage para sa ating mga manggagawa (It is important that the DOLE and the NEDA carefully study the correct criteria to determine the reasonable living wage for our workers),” Villanueva said in a statement.
 
The concerns of the Filipino workers on daily wage, he said, deserves “immediate action and recognition of their poor condition and difficulty in meeting the daily needs of their families.”
 
“Nakikiisa po tayo sa panawagang bilisan ang pag-aaral ng mga panukalang wage adjustments kasabay ng paglalaan ng karampatang tulong para sa mga maliliit na mamumuhunan at pagpapababa ng presyo ng mga pangunahing bilihin at serbisyo (We join the call to speed up the study of the proposed wage adjustments while allocating competent assistance for small investors and lowering the price of basic goods and services),” he said. 
 
The Philippine economy, he said, needs to create adequate decent jobs and to put a stop to the never-ending concerns on contractualization.  
 
“Kailangan pong makagawa ang ekonomiya ng maraming disenteng trabaho at tuldukan na po natin ang matagal na nating pinaglalaban, yung kalakaran ng ENDO mapa sa pribado man o gobyerno (Our economy needs to create more decent jobs and to put an end to what we have been fighting for a long time, the trend of contractualization map, whether it is private or government),” he said.
 
“Itinutulak pa rin natin ang Trabaho Para Sa Bayan na naglalayong bumuo ng komprehensibong plano para sa labor and employment na may kaakibat na pagsuporta sa maliit na negosyo (We are still pushing Trabaho Para Sa Bayan which aims to develop a comprehensive plan for labor and employment with accompanying support to small businesses),” Villanueva reiterated.
 
“Atin pong panindigan ang polisiyang malayang kagustuhan ang maghanapbuhay sa ibang bayan at hindi kapit-sa-patalim kahit na meron na tayong binuong DMW, na sumasagot sa mga pangangailangan ng ating mga OFWs (Let's uphold the policy of free will to make a living in another country and not be forced even though we already have established the DMW, which responds to the needs of our OFWs),” the lawmaker stressed.

208,House leader stresses need to revert to pre-pandemic school calendar amid searing summer,Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 30, 2023 ","House Minority Leader and 4Ps Party-list Rep. Marcelino “Nonoy” Libanan has underscored the ""immediate need"" to return to the old pre-pandemic school calendar with the least disruption possible.
“We are all for the immediate return to the old school calendar with the least possible disruption to classes,” Libanan said in a statement Sunday, April 30.
“Many children from poor households, including 4Ps beneficiaries in the provinces, tend to walk long distances going to or coming from school. The prolonged physical exertion, combined with the agonizing heat, puts them at risk of heat exhaustion,” he noted.
The tweaked school calendar resulting from Covid-19 lockdowns has forced schoolchildren to attend classes during the summer, which in the past was their vacation period.
Libanan previously represented the lone district of Eastern Samar in Congress before he was elected 4Ps party-list representative.
President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. earlier said that government was studying the return to the pre-pandemic school calendar as the unbearable summer heat tends to make learning difficult.
In the current school year, 203 days of classes started on Aug. 22, 2022 and will end on July 7, 2023, thus putting children in school during the hottest summer months of April and May.
In the school year immediately prior to the pandemic, classes began on June 3, 2019 and ended on April 3, 2020.
The Department of Health (DOH) has been reporting several cases of heat-related illness affecting students since March.
Last week, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services (PAGASA) warned that the “heat index” around the country has reached “dangerous levels” ranging from 42 to 51 degrees Celsius.

209,PH a ‘significant beneficiary’ of Australia’s P3.6-B maritime programs,Raymund Antonio,"Apr 30, 2023 ","The Philippines is a “significant beneficiary” of the P3.6-billion Indo-Pacific maritime programs sponsored by the Australian government to expand the region’s maritime security and marine environment protection, Australian Embassy Deputy Head of Mission Dr. Moya Collett said.
The pronouncement was made when the envoy spoke during a forum entitled, “Protecting the Seas: Preserving Biodiversity Through Marine Protection in the West Philippine Sea”, organized by the Stratbase ADR Institute.
Noting that Australia’s relationship with the Philippines encompasses defense and security, development and education, trade and investment, and people to people links, the envoy stressed that the two countries’ maritime cooperation “is going from strength to strength.”
“Given the importance of maritime security and marine environmental protection to Australia, we are investing P3.6 billion in regional maritime programs and the Philippines is a significant beneficiary,” Collett explained.
“The marine environment is under threat from pollution, climate change, and over exploitation. And it is more important than ever that we work together to protect it. And we are proud to support the Philippines in its efforts to preserve the marine environment and become more climate change and disaster resilient,” she added.
Through the program, Australia is funding a number of coral restoration projects throughout the Philippines, including in Pangasinan and Verde Islands, and in the West Philippine Sea in Palawan and Zambales.
“Australia highly values its maritime partnership with the Philippines, and we will continue to work together to protect maritime biodiversity, which is so important to the health and prosperity of our two nations,” the envoy said.
Stratbase ADR Institute President Dindo Manhit, for his part, stressed the importance of continued multilateral cooperation among like-minded states.
The conservation and preservation of marine life, he argued, is a shared responsibility.
“In all these endeavors, the efforts of the national and international community to secure biodiversity and promote tourism must complement and respect the Philippines’ 2016 arbitral victory,” he said, taking note of the 2016 The Hague ruling on China’s claims in the resource-rich region.
Manhit lamented that during the 2016 arbitral ruling revealed that China’s land reclamation and construction of artificial islands had caused “irreparable harm to the coral reef ecosystem” and permanently destroyed the evidence of the natural conditions of various reefs.
“These unlawful practices are being carried out until the present and continue to cause severe damage to the marine life and ecosystems that make the West Philippine Sea a critical fishing area for the country’s food and economic security,” he added.

210,Villafuerte bats for passage of these 2 pro-teacher bills ahead of Labor Day,Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 30, 2023 ","Ahead of the celebration of Labor Day on May 1, Camarines Sur 2nd district Rep. LRay Villafuerte urged the House of Representatives to pass two bills that would make life easier for public school teachers.
“I am likewise hoping that the House could give priority attention after the break to a measure bumping up the salaries and making permanent an allowance for the teaching supplies of our  800,000 public schoolteachers,” he said in a statement Sunday, April 30.
Villafuerte, majority leader of the powerful Commission on Appointments (CA), was referring to House Bill (HB) Nos. 1851 and 1849.
HB No.1851 proposes a significant increase in the salary grade level of public elementary and high school teachers from Grade 11 to Grade 19 amid the non-stop rise in the cost of living.
On the other hand, HB No. 1849 seeks to make permanent the school supply allowance of P5,000 that public school teachers have been entitled to during the Covid-19 pandemic. It further provides for a continuous increase in the allowance every year.
Villafuerte wants the lower chamber to approve the bills once sessions resume on May 8.
“Despite their heavy workload and essential role as agents of constructive intellectual, social, cultural, political and moral change in our society, our public school teachers are among the most underpaid workers in the country,"" he said.
“Increasing their takehome pay and providing for a permanent teaching supplies allowance with a provision for a steady bump per school year will hopefully incentivize them to strive for excellence in their field  and make teaching a more attractive profession for our students,” added the Bicolano.

211,Gatchalian renews push for bill creating Virology and Vaccine Institute of the Philippines,Hannah Torregoza,"Apr 30, 2023 ","Senator Sherwin Gatchalian on Sunday, April 30 pushed for the passage of the bill that seeks to strengthen local vaccine development through the creation of the Virology and Vaccine Institute of the Philippines.
 
Under Senate Bill No. 941, or the proposed Virology and Vaccine Institute of the Philippines (VIP) Act of 2022, which he filed, the VIP will serve as the premier research and development institute in the field of virology, encompassing all areas in viruses and viral diseases in plants, animals, and humans.
 
Gatchalian made the call amid the country’s celebration of the World Immunization Week this last week of April.
 
“Nakita natin noong kasagsagan ng pandemya ng COVID-19 na mahalaga ang pagiging handa, lalo na sa pagpapalawig ng ating kakayahan sa pag-aaral ng iba't ibang virus at viral diseases (If we have a Virology and Vaccine Institute, we can make sure that we are better prepared and it will be easier to discover vaccines and suppress diseases),” said Gatchalian.
 
“Kung magkakaroon tayo ng Virology and Vaccine Institute, matitiyak natin na mas handa tayo at mas mapapadali ang pagtuklas sa mga bakuna at masugpo ang mga sakit (We saw during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic that preparedness is important, especially in expanding our ability to study different viruses and viral diseases),” he said.
 
According to Gatchalian, the measure will pave way for the hiring of a pool of highly trained local virology experts and the creation of appropriate facilities which can enable researchers to rapidly conduct studies on any virus and guide authorities in implementing evidence-informed response strategies.
 
He also said the proposed VIP will also be mandated to accept scientific and technological research and development (R&D) in the field of virology and develop an information system on virology science and technology for the use of both public and private sectors.
 
Under the bill, the VIP’s research outputs shall be integrated with plans for the management of public health emergencies relating to infectious disease, as well as other plans relating to disease control and prevention.
 
It will also be mandated to establish strategic partnerships with the world's leading scientists, virology centers and institutes, and conduct innovative and pioneering research that will advance the frontiers of virology in the country, Gatchalian said.

212,PH should keep protesting even if China is 'deaf'--Recto,Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 30, 2023 ","House Deputy Speaker and Batangas 6th district Rep. Ralph Recto underscored the importance of protesting China's acts of aggression in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) at every turn, even if the military and economic giant is ""deaf"".
“Kahit bingi sila (Even if they're deaf), we have to blow our whistle again and again. At least, the whole world would hear,” Recto said in a statement Sunday, April 30.
“’Yung pag protesta natin, ng pamahalaan man o ng mamamayan, ay parang burglar alarm that goes off when it is tripped. Ang masama ay if we turn it off. Tuloy-tuloy lang (Our protests, be it from government or common citizens, are akin to a burglar alarm that goes off when it is tripped. What's bad is if we turn it off. We should keep it up),” he said.
Recto made the statement as the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) reportedly plans to fire another round of diplomatic protests against Beijing following the harassment by Chinese ships of two Coast Guard patrol boats near Ayungin Shoal.
""Hindi ‘yan asal ng isang nagsasabing kaibigan niya tayo (These isn't an act from someone who considers us as a friend),” Recto said of China.
“Even if we have to wallpaper the Great Wall with diplomatic protests, we should continue because once we show any sign of wavering, it normalizes China’s misbehavior inside our territory,” he said.
""We also owe it to our neighbors, who are the subject of Chinese incursions, to make noise,” added the former Senate President Pro Tempore.
""That kind of maritime patintero, which China has perfected, has become part of the seascape. It never passes a chance to display its bully credentials,” Recto said.
Last year, a total of 195 notes verbales on WPS incidents were filed by the DFA with the Chinese embassy.
The one filed on the second week of February, which denounced ""dangerous maneuvers"" of the Chinese Coast Guard in Ayungin Shoal, was the 75th “note verbale” filed under the Marcos administration.

She was the guest of honor and speaker in the celebration during the town’s 171st founding anniversary and its Kanen Festival, which celebrates the town’s local delicacies.
Duterte lauded the local government for putting importance on the livelihood of people, one of which was making local kakanin or native delicacies usually made with sticky rice and coconut cream.

The President assured Filipino workers that the government would not neglect their plight and promised to protect them.

Ople also expressed her gratitude to Philippine Ambassador Ezzedin Tago to Egypt and his team for what she described as hard work in having the exit clearances of the OFWs and their families approved.
She said Ambassador Tago and Vice-Consul Bojer Capati are also currently helping around 14 OFWs at a different Egyptian border to get the necessary immigration clearances. 
The DMW has been actively assisting OFWs in Sudan, especially those who wanted to be repatriated due to the worsening security situation in the area.
Over 700 OFWs and Filipinos have already contacted the nearest Philippine embassy and around half of them earlier asked the Philippine government for repatriation.
Ople also vowed to provide financial and livelihood assistance to the Filipinos who decided to be repatriated. 
On the other hand, she said she has been coordinating with his counterpart in Saudi Arabia for the temporary employment of some of the affected OFWs that would be repatriated from Sudan. 
"
216,Gov’t urged to regularly review deployment policies on OFWs,Hannah Torregoza,"Apr 30, 2023 ","Senator Grace Poe on Sunday, April 30 urged the government to regularly review its deployment policies on overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) to ensure their safety and well-being.
 
Poe made the call even as the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) were able to successfully repatriate the first batches of OFWs from conflict-torn Sudan.
 
“We understand the need of our people for better paying jobs, but it is also incumbent upon the government to constantly review its deployment policies to ensure the safety of our countrymen working abroad,” Poe said in a statement.
 
Poe said she will continue to hope for the safe return of the remaining OFWs and trusts that the government will continue to undertake all efforts to bring Filipinos in Sudan to safety.
 
“We laud the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Migrant Workers for acting quickly and working tirelessly in facilitating the passage of our OFWs to secure borders on their way home,” the senator also said.
 
“We will continue to hope for the safe return of the remaining Filipinos in the area,” she said.
 
Poe also said she hopes that support systems are in place to assist returning Filipinos find alternative jobs or livelihood back in the Philippines, or to undergo skills retooling or training if they wish to.

217,Expert calls for routine immunization ramp-up,Analou de Vera,"Apr 30, 2023 ","A pediatric infectious disease specialist has called for more intensified efforts for the country’s routine immunization to prevent cases of vaccine-preventable diseases from rising.
There is an “urgent need to double-time on increasing childhood vaccination in the country,” said Dr. Anna Lisa Ong-Lim,  professor and chief of division of infectious and tropical disease in pediatrics at the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH).
Ong-Lim said it is necessary to increase the vaccination coverage to 90 percent.
“Karamihan ng nag-a-access ng ating public health services ay talagang hindi nakasunod sa schedule. Ang nangyari noong pandemya (Most of those who access our public health services are really not able to follow the schedule. What happened during the pandemic) is that our immunization coverage decreased significantly,” she said in a statement.
“Most of our immunization coverage is roughly about 50 percent. Ano ba ang target natin? 90 percent, conservative pa yon. So kailangan ng catch-up [immunization] (What is our target? 90 percent, that's still conservative. So catch-up [immunization] is needed),” she added.
More children will be at risk of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases if the immunization coverage remains low, said Ong-Lim.
“If vaccination rates continue to be low, children are at constant risk of contracting infectious diseases,” she said.
Last April 27, the Department of Health (DOH) launched a national supplemental immunization campaign with a goal of vaccinating at least 11 million children against measles, rubella, and polio. The program will officially start on May 2 and will run until May 31.
“One of the Department’s evergreen goals is to protect our children from vaccine preventable diseases and those include measles, rubella, and polio,"" said DOH Officer-in-Charge Maria Rosario Vergeire in a separate statement.
“This is also a time to renew public trust in the value of all vaccines and continue to build long-term support and awareness for immunization, as vaccines have proven to be critical in containing or limiting outbreaks of infectious diseases,” she added.
Meanwhile, the League of Municipalities of the Philippines (LMP) expressed its support for this vaccination campaign.
“The success of vaccination programs relies heavily on their implementation by local government units, the workhorses of national government agencies,” said LMP Secretary General and Barcelona, Sorsogon Mayor Atty. Cynthia Falcotelo-Fortes in a statement.
Falcotelo-Fortes assured that municipal local government units (MLGUs) “shall continue to advocate the wisdom and importance of routine and catch-up immunization.”
“In the case of vaccination, yes, DOH crafted and funded programs cascaded to MLGUs: from the supply of the vaccines to disease awareness support under its Healthy Pilipinas campaign, but these are not the only programs out there that MLGUs actualize,” she said.
“MLGUs have a big pie of programs, projects, and activities on health and a myriad of local services. Vaccination is but a slice of that pie. Prioritization is key. Routine immunization should rank high in the order of priorities,” she added.

218,"NCRPO urges Labor Day protesters to observe laws, existing LGU ordinances",Aaron Recuenco,"Apr 30, 2023 ","The National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) has advised protesters to observe existing laws and ordinances of the local government units (LGUs) in the conduct of their programs for the May 1 Labor Day celebration.
But NCRPO director Maj. Gen. Edgar Alan Okubo assured that his men would exercise maximum tolerance in dealing with any protest action for the Labor Day celebration in Metro Manila.

“Your NCRPO is in high gear and ready to secure our residents from any eventuality. We will exert maximum tolerance following the principles of force continuum and give our utmost respect for human rights,” said Okubo.
“I would like to remind the public to always follow existing laws and ordinances related to freedom of expression, mass actions, and utilization of freedom parks. Everyone's safety and security is our primary concern,"" he added.
Okubo said a total of 10,529 policemen will be deployed in various areas in Metro Manila to man the NCRPO’s Civil Disturbance Management company, anti-criminality interventions, counter-terrorism efforts, traffic management, emergency response teams, and other related  security measures in and around Metro Manila. 
The number includes over 1,000 Reactionary Standby Support Force (RSSF) from the Regional Headquarters.
“Lateral coordination with other law enforcement agencies has been established for a more comprehensive security coverage,” said Okubo.
The NCRPo deployment is part of the 59,000 policemen across the country that were tapped to secure both the Labor Day celebration and the long weekend.

219,"Happiness at home to make Pinoy workers more productive, says pro-divorce solon",Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 30, 2023 ","While other lawmakers are preoccupied with legislation to hike workers' pay, Davao del Norte 1st district Rep. Pantaleon Alvarez wants to put focus on another important need of Filipino laborers--happiness at home.
Alvarez emphasized ahead of Labor Day celebration this Monday, May 1 the importance of recognizing the rights of Filipino workers, including the right to dissolve an unhappy, abusive, and toxic marriages.
""On this Labor Day, we must remember that the well-being of Filipino workers extends beyond the workplace. We must ensure that our laws protect their rights in every aspect of their lives, including their personal relationships,"" said Alvarez, a former House Speaker.
""Divorce is a reality for many Filipino families, and it is time for us to acknowledge that reality and create a legal framework that reflects it,"" he noted.
Alvarez believes that Filipino workers must be given the opportunity to end their marriages in a safe and legal manner to alleviate the emotional and psychological burdens that come with being trapped in an unhappy or abusive relationship.
This, in turn, would allow them to focus on their careers and reach their full potential in the workplace.
""Experience has shown that workers in unhappy marriages are more likely to experience health problems, such as depression and anxiety, which can result in increased absenteeism and decreased productivity. Additionally, those who are in abusive relationships may struggle to maintain a steady work schedule due to physical injuries or emotional trauma,"" he said.
Alvarez, through House Bill (HB) No.4998, or the “Absolute Divorce Act of 2022, is pushing for the legalization of divorce in the Philippines— currently the only country in the world, aside from the Vatican, where divorce is illegal.
He explained how allowing divorce in the Philippines would have a significant impact on the well-being and productivity of Filipino workers.
According to a study conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), almost half of the country's labor force is comprised of married individuals. For those who are trapped in unhappy, abusive, and toxic marriages, the stress and emotional turmoil of their situation can have a profound impact on their ability to perform at work, he said.
""We cannot continue to deny our fellow Filipinos the right to a second chance at happiness, meaning, and fulfillment. As we celebrate Labor Day and honor the contributions of our hardworking citizens, let us also commit to creating a more just and compassionate society that values the well-being of all our people,” he said.

“The United States stands with the Philippines in the face of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) Coast Guard’s continued infringement upon freedom of navigation in the South China Sea,” a statement from the Office of the Spokesperson said.
The US reiterated its commitment to come to the Philippines’ defense, as it warned China anew that an attack on Philippines armed forces in the South China Sea would trigger the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty between the US and the Philippines.
Washington reminded Beijing of its obligations to its partner following the continued routine patrols by Chinese vessels within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Philippines.

Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Secretary Enrique Manalo welcomed a total of 17 evacuees who initially sought refuge in Athens, Greece, and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
Nine of them, including an infant, got out of Khartoum through Port Sudan, where they were able to board a C-130 plane of the Saudi Royal Airforce that was bound for Jeddah.
The Philippine consulate received them on April 27, and provided them with travel documents, particularly those who were not able to bring their passports.
The Overseas Workers Welfare Association (OWWA) shouldered the flight of the eight of them, who were overseas Filipino workers (OFWs); while the Philippine Consulate in Jeddah covered the plane fare of another Filipino, who was a student in Sudan.
Meanwhile, the eight remaining evacuees from the first batch escaped the fighting after boarding a military evacuation flight launched by the Greek government bound for Athens. They were all hotel workers in Sudan.
The Philippine Embassy in Athens received them on April 28, and were provided with free plane fare to Manila using the Assistance-To-Nationals Fund.
“The Philippine government is working round-the-clock to assist our kababayans who have left Sudan,” Manalo said, thanking also the foreign governments that extended assistance to Filipino evacuees.

The number of active cases nationwide stood at 5,070, the DOH said.
Among the regions with the largest number of new infections in the last 14 days were the National Capital Region with 2,533, Calabarzon with 1,124, Davao Region with 420, Western Visayas with 367, and Central Luzon with 358.
The country's overall tally of confirmed cases already reached 4,092,158, of which 4,020,644 were recoveries and 66,444 were deaths.
Meanwhile, there is no cause for alarm over the recent uptick in cases, said infectious disease expert Dr. Rontgene Solante of the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila.
“I can totally say that we’re still in a stable condition even with this increase on the cases and this is driven by the fact that hindi pa napupuno at wala tayong signals na mapupuno ang mga hospital (the hospitals are not yet full and we have no signals that the capacities of hospitals will be full),” said Solante during a public briefing on Friday, April 28.
“If you look at the data na maski tumataas nang bahagya ang mga kaso, hindi rin tumataas ang mga namamatay, hindi tumataas ang nagsi-severe Covid at hindi rin tumaas iyong napupunta sa hospital (even though the cases are slightly increasing, the number of deaths, severe Covid, and the hospital admissions are not rising),” he added.
Solante reminded the public to always assess their risk and that the use of face masks is still necessary. He also believes that the use of face masks should remain voluntary.
“Well, ang tingin ko dito (my take on this) and this is also the observation in other countries – that as long as there are these variants of interest, we will continue to encourage people to wear their face mask. And when we say encourage people, particularly the vulnerable population,” he said.
“Why? Because encouraging them to wear the face mask instead of mandatory, we will give that particular decision na tuturuan natin ang mga tao (to teach people) on how to protect ourselves,” he added.

Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said a sizzling heat index of 43°C was recorded in Aparri, Cagayan on Saturday. Heat index is the “apparent temperature” that humans perceive.

228,LTO not allowed to use earnings to buy plastic cards,Aaron Recuenco,"Apr 29, 2023 ","The Land Transportation Office (LTO) is not authorized to use its earnings from all its transactions for procurement of goods and services, including the plastic cards for the driver’s license which is already running out.
LTO Finance Division Chief Marivic Lopez issued the clarification in response to the statement of House Deputy Speaker and Batangas 6th district Rep. Ralph Recto who criticized the agency over its  alleged inefficiency and lack of foresight.
“The LTO is not authorized to retain funds collected or received from the day-to-day operations. All funds collected are remitted the following day,” said Lopez.
“The fund of the LTO comes from the General Appropriations Act and not from its daily collections,” he added.
The LTO is now facing a shortage of plastic cards which are being used in the printing of driver’s licenses. A number of LTO offices across the country have already run out of supply.
This forced the LTO to extend the validity of driver’s licenses that are set to expire from April 24 onwards.
Recto said that the P249 million that LTO supposedly needs to print the needed 5.2 million plastic driver’s license cards is what the agency earns “in a mere three and half days"", as he revealed that the LTO posted revenues of P26.68 billion last year, “which comes up to P73 million a day"".
“Not all procurement debacles stem from lack of money. Some are caused by inefficiency, by agencies rich in resources but poor in foresight,” Recto was quoted saying.
LTO chief JayArt Tugade earlier explained that they were ready to procure plastic cards as early as December last year after an inventory revealed that the plastic cards supply would only last for April this year.
But he disclosed that the LTO was prevented from doing so since the Department of Transportation had issued a special order that centralizes the procurement of all its agencies for P50 million and above.

229,'Kaibigan?': Senator JV slams China’s bullying of PH,Mario Casayuran,"Apr 29, 2023 ","Senate Deputy Majority Leader Joseph Victor ‘’JV’’ Ejercito laments China’s bullying tactics against Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessels and Filipino fishermen in the West Philippine Sea (WPS).
""Ang nakakalungkot dito ang China laging ipinapalabas na tayo ay magkaalyado, magkaibigan pero ang ginagawa ng kanilang coast guard at militia nila ay talagang bastusan na ito, saka bullying talaga (What is sad is that China goes at great lengths to show that we are its allies, its friends but what Chinese Coast Guard and militia do is a clear case of very bad manners and bullying),’’ Ejercito said during a DWIZ radio interview Saturday, April 29.
He was referring to the recent near-collision between a small PCG vessel and a larger Chinese Coast Guard vessel in the WPS.
A collision was avoided when the PCG vessel maneuvered to avoid the foreign vessel.
Ejercito said that the Philippines is not a super power and has no capability to match China’s military might.
‘’So talagang binubully nila at dahandahan talagang inaangkin na nila ang ating mga teritoryo (So China is really bullying us while it continues to take over our territory),’’ he pointed out.
What the Philippines should do, according to Ejercito is to forge alliances with ‘’right thinking nations’’, countries that are our most likely allies that are also being bullied by China such as Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam and eventually ally with  Australia and the US.
Such alliances are not meant to be aggressive but to help in making parts of the South China Sea open to maritime passage ‘’para di nananakot ang mga barko ng China (so that Chinese vessels would not threaten their vessels)"", he added.
Asked whether China’s bullying has something to do with the Enhanced Defense Cooperation (EDCA) sites between the Philippines and United States (US), Ejercito said this is ‘’possible"".
He cited the US visit of the Taiwan President and visit of US political leaders to Taiwan caused China showed its aggressiveness by staging military drills near Taiwan.
‘’Wala silang pakialam kahit tayo ay kaalyado ng ibang bansa (They do not care whether we are allies of other countries),’’ he added.
On the US trip and meeting of President Ferdinand ‘’Bongbong’’ Marcos Jr. with US President Joe Biden, Ejercito said the Philippines is known as a close ally of the US but on the ‘’military side na ibinibigay isa tayo sa mababa, kung talagang kakampi natin sila yung MDT
dapat totohanin (on the military side, we are one of those given very low assistance and if we are really its ally, it should make the Military Defense Treaty believable)"".
He said President Marcos should also emphasize to Biden that the US should prioritize Philippine produce.

230,DPWH sets sight in the construction of a major Batangas road network,Chito Chavez,"Apr 29, 2023 ","A major road network project linking the towns of Mabini and Lemery in Batangas is now being rushed  for completion, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) said on Saturday, April 29.
With a total budget cost of P5.3 billion, the Mabini-Bauan-San Luis-Taal-Lemery Road is a vital road link from mabini to Lemery towns “via the coastline alignment of Balayan Bay, traversing the towns of Bauan, San Luis and Taal, with a projected length of 21.71 kilometers.’’
“The improvement of the road connectivity is crucial given the province's expanding tourism sector,’’ the DPWH noted.
The DPWH added that a huge number of people from Metro Manila had frequently chosen Batangas as their destination for a quick getaway because of the province's accessibility, adding that the project will dramatically reduce travel time from Lemery to Mabini.
Aside from the reduced travel time, the project will also serve as an access road to the coastal parts of the municipalities of Bauan and San Luis, which will benefit the residents from the adjacent areas of San Pascual town and Batangas City among others.
On Friday, April 28, DPWH Secretary Manuel Bonoan led other local and government officials in the groundbreaking ceremony of the multi-billion road project.
Aside from Bonoan, those present in the event were DPWH Undersecretary for Operations Antonio V. Molano Jr., Deputy House Speaker Rep. Ralph G. Recto, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Benhur Abalos, DILG Barangay Affairs Undersecretary to Chito Valmocina, Batangas Gov.  Hermilando Mandanos, Batangas 2nd District Rep.

231,Teacher from Ilocos to receive 2023 Princess Maha Chakri Award in October,Merlina Hernando-Malipot,"Apr 29, 2023 ","A teacher from the Ilocos Region is the Philippines’ fifth recipient of the prestigious 2023 Princess Maha Chakri Awards (PMCA), the Department of Education (DepEd) announced.
Jerwin O. Valencia, Teacher III of Digras National High School in Ilocos Norte, is one of 11 recipients of the PMCA in South East Asia for presenting a significant impact on student’s lives through his initiatives and projects.
Valencia, DepEd said, was recognized for his exceptional contribution to education and his advocacies for a sustainable community. He will receive the award on October 17 in Thailand.
DepEd said Valencia launched the Backyard to Kitchen Project Year 2 to create a sustainable community for his learner and their families.
Through the project, Valencia helps beneficiaries to cultivate their gardens at home by providing seedlings for them to produce a BIN-I (seeds) that they can use for the next crop making this project sustainable.
Valencia, DepEd added, also created the project Ayat Para Iti Arapaap (Gift of Love for a Dream), which aims to motivate children to strive more for their studies, assist them in their studies, including mental health and emotional aspect through the support of individuals, and develop skills and relationship of children through arts and craft.
DepEd said that Valencia also initiated the Project Wag MATHakot, which provided learners an opportunity for on-task activity through games and technology-innovative activities, and Project MATH (Make A Tremendous Help), which includes the practical application of Mathematics, such as constructing plant boxes in different shapes and recyclable materials to foster environmental awareness among them.
“Aside from being a Math teacher, Valencia is also a reservist of the Philippine Air Force and a Boy Scout of the Philippines Disaster Risk Reduction Management Coordinator,” DepEd said.
The Princess Maha Chakri Award is given once every two years to recognize teachers who change students’ lives, particularly disadvantaged groups.
It aims to promote excellent practices to inspire and serve as examples for other teachers in Southeast Asia.
DepEd said that since 2015, four Filipino educators have received the PMCA including William Moraca from General Santos City (2015); Jesus Insilada of Iloilo City (2017), Sadat Minandang from Cotabato City (2019), and Marcelo T. Otinguey of Benguet City (2021).

233,Solidum cites genomics research's contribution to PH healthcare,Dhel Nazario,"Apr 29, 2023 ","Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Sec. Renato Solidum, Jr. cited the country's genomic research which has contributed to various areas, such as disease diagnosis and management and the country’s COVID-19 pandemic response.
“In the Philippines, genomics research has significantly contributed to healthcare in different ways,” Solidum said during the DOST Genomics Program at the Philippine Genome Center (PGC) in Diliman, Quezon City.
According to Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD), among the accomplishments he cited include the commercialization of rapid dengue diagnostic kits and the COVID-19 test kits developed by the Manila HealthTek Inc., and the identification of genetic variations and molecular features associated with hypoglycemic response in diabetes, leptospirosis, and sepsis complications studied by local experts and scientists.
In line with the theme “From Lab to Lives,” Solidum discussed how investing in R&D such as in the field of genomics can create resilient and sustainable societies, drive innovation and economic growth, and ultimately improve the quality of lives of Filipinos.
“The DOST Genomics Program is an excellent example of how investing in research and development can lead to significant advancements in various fields, creating new products and business opportunities and employing additional staff, resulting in income generating partnerships,” Solidum said.
The press conference also featured initiatives supported by the DOST-PCHRD, which include the Filipino Genomes Research Program (FGRP) led by the UP National Sciences Research Institute (NSRI), which aims to examine genetic data that are attributable to the Filipino population, and the project led by the University of the Philippines – National Institutes of Health (UP-NIH), which aims to investigate the uniquely Filipino disease X-Linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism (XDP).
Under the FGRP, he discussed how the country also made significant strides towards forensic investigation: “We have established a comprehensive Filipino DNA marker database for identifying criminal offenders and supporting other DNA profiling applications.”
He also highlighted the local Sexual Assault Investigation Kit (SAK) developed by Dr. Maria Corazon De Ungria and her team at the UP-NSRI, which doctors in the Philippines can use to collect biological samples from victims of sexual abuse, including child patients.
The kit is being utilized by a component project under the FGRP that aims to validate collection, storage and data analysis strategies for biological samples from child victims of sexual abuse.
In a separate presentation, Executive Director of the UP-NIH Dr. Eva Cutiongco – de la Paz discussed the importance of  generating knowledge on XDP. “Our goal is to provide a comprehensive picture of the prevalence of the genetic cause of XDP in the country,” Cutiongco-de la Paz said.
“This will provide very important data on the development of health services and allocation of resources, such as for PhilHealth packages, that can improve the quality of life of those affected by XDP,” she added.
The DOST and the PCHRD support health-related research on genomics for the development of personalized/precision medicines, diagnostics, therapeutics, other technologies, and as support to health and clinical practice guidelines and policies in the country. In 2022 alone, the DOST allotted more than 320 million pesos of funding support for health research in genomics.
“With the milestones of successful DOST investments, we are confident that we can continue transforming scientific ideas from the laboratory into tangible innovations and development that benefit the lives of Filipinos,” Solidum said.

234,"Drug addiction problem must be confronted with empathy, compassion, and understanding --- Duterte",Merlina Hernando-Malipot,"Apr 29, 2023 ","As it continues to strengthen drug education and prevention campaigns, the Department of Education (DepEd) underscored the importance of empathy, compassion, and understanding in dealing with drug addiction problems.
“We must confront [drug addiction] problem with empathy, compassion, and understanding while arming ourselves with determination and bravery to pull our barkada away from the trap of drug addiction,” Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Z. Duterte said during the 3rd National Barkada Kontra Droga Convention (NBKDC).
DepEd, in cooperation with the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB), highlighted the importance of preventive education in curbing drug-related concerns and how to strengthen programs and interventions against substance abuse in schools and the community during the event.
Meanwhile, DepEd Assistant Secretary for Operations Dexter Galban urged learners to continue advocating and participating in drug abuse prevention activities.
“All of you here today, coming from different regions of the country, are given the opportunity and even the challenge to become champions,” Galban said.
“You’re here today for a reason. You’re here today to serve as beacons of hope for those having difficulty saying no to illegal drugs, saying no to substance abuse,” he added.
During the three-day event hosted by DepEd SOCCSKSARGEN, attendees listened to discussions on the salient features of the DepEd policy on the BKD Plus Program; the policies, updates, and intervention for the Department's No Smoking Campaign; and how to develop information education communication materials, among others.
The event also aimed to strengthen camaraderie, collaboration, cooperation, and solidarity in BKD implementers' commitment to attaining a drug-free lifestyle through sharing leadership stories and best practices, and formulation of action plans to prevent drug abuse in schools and the community.
Meanwhile, Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) Undersecretary Earl Saavedra emphasized the need to curb the vulnerabilities of the youth by not allowing them to become victims of substance abuse.
“BKD is not only a flagship program that starts and ends with interagency commitment,” Saavedra said.
“We were able to walk the talk pagdating sa BKD by tapping partners and stakeholders who are our important allies pagdating sa pagsugpo ng (when it comes to curbing) drug addiction in our communities,” he added.

236,Senate panel submits to Palace recommendation banning POGOs in PH,Mario Casayuran,"Apr 29, 2023 ","The Senate Ways and Means Committee chaired by Senator Sherwin Gatchalian has submitted to Malacañang its chairman’s report seeking the ban of Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGO) in the country.
Gatchalian said he submitted the report to Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin in a bid to show the executive branch the reasons and study why POGO operations in the country should be banned.
He said that in the last budget hearing, Bersamin had said that they are waiting for the Senate committee report so that they would have a basis in banning POGO operations.
Gatchalian also said that the executive branch would want to see the recommendations so that it would come up with ways of implementing the recommendations.
He said that based on their findings, “The Filipino people stand to lose more than they will gain from allowing POGOs to continue operating in the Philippines.”
“In light of this, we recommend the permanent banning of offshore gaming operations in the Philippines,” Gatchalian said in his chairman’s report.
It had undertaken public hearings on the effect to Philippine economy by POGO operations.
But the Senate public order and dangerous drugs committee had recommended the operation of POGOs in a controlled area similar to economic zones.
Senator Ronald ‘’Bato’’ dela Rosa, committee chairman, said he does not recommend the immediate banning of POGO operations.
Instead, he said that these should be phased out in one to two years or two to three years depending on the vote of senators during a plenary debate.
Dela Rosa had told Senate reporters said the operation of POGOs in a controlled zone is recommended so that government could strictly supervise their operations and avoid the occurrence of crimes.
At present, POGOs operations are scattered in the Luzon area such as Paranaque, Pasay, Cavite, Pampanga, Tarlac and Cagayan.
The recommendation to ban POGOs, he said, is premised squarely on the detailed findings of the legislative inquiry, one of which finds the POGO business model as inherently unstable due to the outsized foreign regulatory and political risks involved.
“By triangulating POGO spending figures by currency and foreign national employment figures, the Committee found substantial basis to conclude that a sizable majority of customers placing bets through POGO operators are Chinese nationals,” he said.
In essence, Gatchalian said Chinese nationals are using offshore gaming operations based in the Philippines as a loophole to circumvent Chinese criminal law.
Thus, he said, it is no surprise that the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in the Philippines has released several public statements in relation to its citizens involved in gambling in the Philippines, on September 27, 2021, September 22, 2022, and October 11, 2022.
“The strongest statement was the most recent, when the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy said: ‘Crimes induced by and associated with POGO not only harm China’s interests and China-Philippines relations, but also hurt the interests of the Philippines. It is therefore widely believed that social costs of POGO far outweigh its economic benefits to the Philippines in the long run and POGO should be tackled  from the root so as to address the social ills in a sweeping manner’,” he said.
“I can imagine the Philippine government would react in a similar way if a foreign ally were allowing Filipinos to bet on prohibited games like jueteng or e-sabong through online casinos housed in another country,” he pointed out.
Gatchalian also said the POGO industry poses troubling social risks in the Philippines, noting that the Philippine National Police (PNP), during its investigation, has said there were at least 102 POGO-related crimes reported between the period of Jan. 1, 2017 and Jan. 23, 2023; 316 people were victimized by these crimes, the vast majority of the victims—214—were Chinese, while 28 were Filipinos.
“The most common crime reported in connection to the POGO industry was the heinous crime of kidnap-for-ransom, with 30 cases recorded during the five-year period. 14 cases of trafficking of persons were also recorded, along with 13 violations of the Access Devices Regulation Act and 10 cases of kidnapping and serious illegal detention,” he said.
Gatchalian also said that based on the panel’s inquiry and findings, the POGO industry also appears to be a potent source of financial crime, citing a report of the Anti-Money Laundering Council that POGOs and their service providers are highly vulnerable to money laundering.

DSWD spokesperson Assistant Secretary Romel Lopez said that the 22-year-old graduate's success is a ""concrete indication that DSWD’s 4Ps is a valuable tool in effectively investing in human capital.""
""Patunay po ang tagumpay ni Engr. Alexis Alegado na ang ating 4Ps ay napakahalaga sa bawat pamilyang Pilipino para mapagtapos sa kolehiyo ang kanilang mga anak na siyang makakatulong para sa pag-angat mula sa kahirapan (The success of Engr. Alexis Alegado is proof that our 4Ps is very important for every Filipino family to send their children to college, which can help lift them out of poverty),"" he added.
As per the DSWD Field Office 1's report, Alegado was also a beneficiary of the Expanded Student's Grants-in-Aid Program for Poverty Alleviation (ESGP-PA), which automatically qualified him for the Tertiary Education Subsidy (TES) under Republic Act 10931, or the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act.
""Beneficiaries under ESGP-PA are poor but deserving students belonging to families listed in the DSWD’s 4Ps program. They can enroll in selected State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) taking up the Commission on Higher Education’s (CHED) priority programs and other courses offerings within the government key growth areas.
""TES is one of the four programs under RA 10931 which will provide funding for qualified Filipino students from the poorest-of-the-poor households enrolled in public and private Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs),"" the agency said.
ESGP-PA grantees are also provided with the following assistance: ""allowance for books, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses; a reasonable allowance for the documented rental or purchase of personal computer or laptop and other education-related expenses; an allowance for room and board costs incurred by the student; additional subsidy of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) or a one-time cost of a first licensure examination for graduates of a Board course or program.""

239,"PH, US to discuss planned joint naval sails in Indo-Pacific after success of Balikatan",Martin Sadongdong,"Apr 29, 2023 ","The Philippines and the United States have agreed to finalize their plans of conducting joint naval sails in the waters encompassing the Indo-Pacific region, the Department of National Defense (DND) bared Saturday, April 29.
(President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. witnesses the sinking exercise between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and United States Armed Forces where troops try to sink BRP Pangasinan by firing a variety of weapons as part of Exercise Balikatan 2023 in San Antonio, Zambales on April 26, 2023. File photo via Manila Bulletin)
It was DND Officer in Charge (OIC) Senior Undersecretary Carlito Galvez Jr. who pitched to Admiral John Aquilino, commander of the United States Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), the finalization of the two countries’ plans to hold joint naval sails during the culmination of Exercise Balikatan 2023.
“Galvez suggested the finalization of joint sails by the Philippine and US navies, as well as Joint Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Operations at the soonest possible time,” said DND Spokesperson Arsenio Andolong.
In response, Andolong stated that Aquilino expressed the US INDOPACOM’s readiness to conduct such “cooperative deployments” to “protect the global commons, freedom of navigation, and maintain a free, open, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.”
“Both parties agreed to embark on the mechanisms to pave the way for strengthening our two countries' collective defense and alliance in the near future,” Andolong stressed.
The latest endeavor to iron out the details of the joint naval sails between the Philippines and US came after the final day of the 38th iteration of Balikatan on Friday, April 28. The war games involved 17,600 troops from the two countries, making it the biggest iteration of the activity in almost four decades.
There were also 100 active participants from Australia as well as military contingents from observer-nations including Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Brunei, Japan, South Korea, India, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada. 
For Galvez, the increased security cooperation between the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the US Armed Forces, as well as the sustained implementation of the 2014 Enhanced Defense Security Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), will further hone the interoperability of the Filipino and American troops.
“This will not only enable the AFP to protect and defend Philippine territory, sovereign rights and sovereignty, but also enable it to contribute significantly to peace and stability in the region and fulfill its obligations as a responsible member of the international community,” he noted.
Last month, the DND and the US Department of Defense (DoD) had revealed their intention to conduct joint patrols in the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea (WPS) where the Philippines and China have overlapping territorial claims.
The plan was raised again during the third US-Philippines 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue in Washington, D.C. last April 11. 
At the ministerial dialogue, Galvez, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin III, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Sec.

240,War games showed innovation in PH-US military ties — US envoy,Joseph Pedrajas,"Apr 29, 2023 ","United States Ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson lauded the success of the largest war games between the Philippines and the United States this year, which were highlighted by an ""innovation"" in the ""evolution"" of Washington and Manila's military ties.
At the conclusion of the 38th iteration of the ""Balikatan (shoulder-to-shoulder)"" Exercises between troops of both sides, Carlson said another ""milestone"" has been made.
Over 17,000 US and Philippine forces, along with Australia's, held military exercises for the past weeks, which increased both sides' ""capability to work together on land, at sea, and in the air,"" Carlson said.
Both forces also completed multiple humanitarian projects to improve infrastructure, enhance medical response and strengthen ties with local communities, she added.
""In addition to being unprecedented in terms of size, our forces also introduced cyber and space elements to the exercise scenario, showing our seven-decade-old alliance is constantly evolving to address 21st-century threats,"" she said at the closing ceremony on Friday.
According to Carlson, a US-Philippines military alliance ""plays an irreplaceable role"" in addressing challenges to rules-based international order, climate change, environmental degradation and water scarcity.
She said that ""what happens in the Philippines is critical to what happens in the Indo-Pacific and the world.""
""Our shared resolve to address threats together, embodied in our treaty alliance, is just one pillar in the US-Philippine relationship,"" she asserted.
Carlson expressed her gratitude for those who did their part ""to advance our shared goal of ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific.""
She said the success of this year's exercises ""is an incredible accomplishment, and a testament to the strength of the US-Philippine Alliance.""
""I am sure all our service members who participated in this exercise depart with a deeper sense of the special bond of friendship between our two countries,"" she added.

However, the residents in the affected areas were advised to stay vigilant as aftershocks were expected, said Diego Agustin Mariano, head of OCD joint information center.
“[There was] no reported damages and casualties as of reporting time,” Mariano said in a disaster media bulletin.
He said the OCD in Mimaropa (Region 4B) and concerned local disaster risk reduction and management offices (DRRMOs) were directed to coordinate and monitor any significant developments including aftershocks. 
Mimaropa covers the provinces of Occidental Mindoro, Oriental Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon, and Palawan.
The earthquake struck at 12 a.m. and its epicenter was located 19 km southeast of Looc town. It had a depth of focus of 74 km and was tectonic in origin.
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) downgraded the temblor’s magnitude from 5.5 to 5.2, and verified its exact origin from Calintaan town to Looc.

The fire that started around 2 p.m. Friday was declared out by the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) in Cebu at 12:35 a.m. Saturday, April 29, according to the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG). 
“Per inquiry to MV Diamond Highway’s Operations Manager, Mr. Arnel Villaganas, the fire started from the starboard bow while cutting the vessel's scrap metals,” the PCG said.
The vessel was undergoing salvage operation in Brgy. Punta Engaño after it ran aground in Cebu during the onslaught of Typhoon Odette 2021 when it suddenly went up in flames.
“MV Diamond Highway’s salvage operation [was] for disposal, not repair,” said PCG communications officer Diane Gumatay.
Fortunately, no one got hurt during the incident since all of the 23 personnel conducting scrap operation onboard safely disembarked from the vessel.
Further investigation was conducted to determine the cause of fire. 
However, initial investigation reportedly showed that some of the survivors were dismantling the vessel when acetylene accidentally spilled on paint which sparked the fire.

243,Recto on LTO's plastic card problem: 'Kulang sa diskarte',Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 29, 2023 ","House Deputy Speaker and Batangas 6th district Rep. Ralph Recto says the lack of ""smarts""--and not funds--is the real root cause of the Land Transportation Office's (LTO) plastic driver’s license card woes.
“Not all procurement debacles stem from lack of money. Some are caused by inefficiency, by agencies rich in resources but poor in foresight,” Recto said in a statement Saturday, April 29.
To illustrate his point, the veteran solon said that the P249 million that LTO supposedly needs to print the needed 5.2 million plastic driver’s license cards is what the agency earns “in a mere three and half days"".
“Hindi kakulangan ng pera ang dahilan, pero tila kakulangan sa diskarte (The problem isn't the lack of money, but apparently, the lack of smarts),” Recto said.
Recto said LTO posted revenues of P26.68 billion last year, “which comes up to P73 million a day"".
“So it would only take three-and-half days of LTO collections to fund the P249 million required to purchase a year’s supply of plastic driver’s license cards,” underscored the former Senate President Pro Tempore.
At P19.32 billion, motor vehicle user’s charge and other registration fees accounted for bulk of LTO collections in 2022.
Next were license fees, which contributed P3.24 billion. Fines and penalties added P3.08 billion to its collection haul.
“Doon pa lang sa bayad sa lisensya, isang buwan lang na koleksyon sapat ng pambili ng plastic cards na lisenysa (The one-month collection for the license is enough to purchase the plastic cards),” Recto said.

244,SC reverses Comelec; nullifies ‘election overspending’ charge vs ex-Dinagat Islands Gov Glenda Ecleo,Rey G. Panaligan,"Apr 29, 2023 ","For violation of the constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases, the Supreme Court (SC) has reversed the June 23, 2021 resolution of Commission on Elections (Comelec) which ordered the filing of a criminal case for alleged election overspending against former governor Glenda Buray Ecleo of Dinagat Islands.
Under the Comelec’s rules of procedure, the preliminary investigation of a complaint must be terminated within 20 days from receipt of the counter-affidavits and other evidence of the respondents, and the resolution must be issued within five days thereafter.
The motu proprio (on its own initiative) complaint by the Comelec’s campaign finance unit (CFU) was filed against Ecleo on Dec. 13, 2014 for alleged election overspending in violation of Section 100, in relation to Section 262, of the Omnibus Election Code.
The alleged overspending was reportedly committed by Ecleo during the 2010 gubernatorial election in Dinagat Islands.  She won the election and was re-elected governor in the succeeding 2013 election.
The CFU claimed that based on the 70,353 registered voters in 2010, Ecleo should have spent only P211,059 at P3 per voter.  However, CFU said that Ecleo spent P230,000 or P18,941 more than the allowed amount under the law.
Ecleo denied the allegations in the complaint and pointed out that it was her secretary who prepared the Statement of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCE).  She said her secretary merely surmised the amounts as she (secretary) was not in possession of receipts at the time the SOCE was filed on June 8, 2010.
On June 23, 2021, the Comelec as full commission (en banc) adopted the recommendation of its Law Department and ordered the filing of the criminal charge sheet against Ecleo.
On July 20, 2022, Ecleo received a copy of the resolution.  She filed a petition with the SC on Aug. 12, 2022 and assailed the Comelec’s resolution.
The SC granted Ecleo’s petition in a unanimous full court decision written by Justice Maria Filomena D. Singh.  The SC said:
“In stark contrast to its self-prescribed timelines, the Comelec took seven long years to determine probable cause on the part of Ecleo for violation of an election offense.
“Much had already transpired in the span of time between the filing of the complaint and the issuance of the assailed Resolution.
“Not only did Ecleo complete her term as Governor of Dinagat Islands, she had even been re-elected to the same post and had already completed her second term. Yet, preliminary investigation for an election related charge filed during her first term was still ongoing.”
The SC pointed out a four-fold test to determine whether the right to speedy disposition of cases is violated, namely: the length of the delay, the reasons for such delay, defendant's assertion or non-assertion of his or her right, and the prejudice caused to the defendant as a result of the delay.
“Applying the four-fold test in Ecleo's scenario will yield the finding that her right to speedy disposition of cases has been violated,” the SC said.
It said the Comelec “took an unreasonable amount of time to conduct its preliminary investigation, on an issue that could be resolved by simple arithmetic, without offering a valid explanation for the delay. The uncertainty of this case's outcome caused mental anguish on the part of Ecleo, to her prejudice.”
“Thus, the Court grants the Rule 64 Petition for Certiorari filed by Ecleo, and nullifies the assailed Resolution issued by the Comelec directing the Law Department to file an Information against Ecleo for violation of Section 100, in relation to Section 262, of the Omnibus Election Code,” the SC ruled.

Abalos issued the call to ensure public safety with militant and left-leaning groups holding protests and crowding the major thoroughfares and secondary roads in past Labor Day celebrations.
Abalos specifically reminded the Metro Manila LGUs in tandem with the local police forces to be prepared for any eventuality in the event of rallies and demonstrations conducted by militant and labor groups in their respective areas of jurisdiction.
“While we support all lawful and peaceful activities in commemoration of Labor Day, we must ensure public safety and peace and order,” Abalos said.
Abalos also called on the Regional Peace and Order Council (RPOC)-NCR and PNP to discuss the security measures that need to be enforced in next week’s Labor Day celebration.
“Let us make sure that a sizable security contingent will be fielded particularly in known convergence areas while the policy of maximum tolerance will be strictly observed by police security forces,” Abalos noted.
“I urge our Metro Manila LCEs (local chief executives) and the PNP leadership to enforce a strategic plan to cover various aspects of police operations such as traffic management, civil disturbance management, anti-criminality and counter-terrorism, emergency response, and other necessary measures for an orderly, peaceful, and successful event,” he added.

The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) identified the involved vessels as MV Hong Hai 189, a Sierra Leone-flagged dredger, and MT Petite Soeur, a Marshall Island-flagged oil tanker.
Rear Adm. Armando Balilo, PCG spokesperson, said the collision occurred at 9:30 p.m. which resulted to the sinking of MV Hong Hai 189.
The fatalities were among the 20 crew members of MV Hong Hai 189.
Their identities have yet to be disclosed but one of them was a Chinese seaman whose body was recovered at 7:30 a.m. Saturday, April 29, during a search and rescue (SAR) operation, while the other was a Filipino safety officer who died while being treated at the Bataan General Hospital for injuries.
Meanwhile, 15 other crew members of MV Hong Hai 189 were rescued: three of them are Filipinos and 12 are Chinese. Three other crew members – all Chinese – remained missing.
As for MT Petite Soeur, Balilo said all 21 crew members were safe and in good physical condition. The vessel sustained no significant damage and was anchored in Mariveles, Bataan.
Balilo said rescue vessel Heng Da 19 responded to the incident and rescued the distressed crew members of MV Hong Hai 189.
The PCG, on the other hand, dispatched one of its vessels, several aluminum boats, and rubber boats while the Coast Guard Aviation Force conducted an aerial survey to assist in the ongoing SAR operations.
“The SAR operations for the last three missing crew of MV Hong Hai 189 continue,” Balilo said.
“The authorities will conduct a port state control inspection to MT Petite Soeur to hold and detain the vessel,” he added.
MV Hong Hai 189 made its last port call in Botolan, Zambales while MT Petite Soeur’s was in Mariveles, Bataan, according to PCG.

248,Go cool with adoption of modular learning amid extreme hot weather,Mario Casayuran,"Apr 29, 2023 ","Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go is throwing his support behind the option of modular learning as a way to keep students safe as temperatures rise and power outages become a recurring issue in some parts of the country.
Go, chairman of the Senate Health and Demography Committee, stressed the importance of prioritizing the safety and health of students, especially during extreme weather conditions.
‘’With temperatures soaring, there are growing concerns about the safety of students who might be forced to attend face-to-face classes in extreme heat or during power outages,’’ he said in a statement, Saturday, April 29.
The Department of Education (DepEd) has reminded school heads that they have the authority to suspend face-to-face classes and shift to alternative delivery modes such as modular distance learning because of these concerns.
On April 20, the DepEd issued a memorandum restating that schools have the option to utilize modular distance learning, as outlined in DepEd Order No. 37, released in 2022.
The order empowers school heads to assess if unfavorable circumstances, such as extreme heat or power outages, may significantly impact in-person classroom learning and jeopardize the health and safety of students.
Per the five-day forecast provided by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) for April 25 to 29, the city of Iloilo is anticipated to experience the maximum heat index of 37°C.
Other key cities including Butuan City, Cabanatuan City, Cotabato City, Dagupan City, Davao City, General Santos City, among others, are expected to experience a heat index of 36°C.
Go said he understands these concerns and believes that modular learning is a viable solution to ensure that students can continue to learn without risking their health and safety.
An advocate for the well-being of students, the senator from Davao emphasized the importance of mental health in addressing mental health disorders, which are often overlooked and undetected.
He said he has also been pushing for the passage of his proposed Senate Bill (SB) No. 1786, which seeks to mandate public higher education institutions to establish Mental Health Offices in their respective campuses.
Go also serves as co-author of Senator Sherwin Gatchalian’s SB No.379, known as the Basic Education Mental Health and Well-Being Promotion Act, which aims to provide mental health services, emotional, developmental and preventive programs, and other support services in the basic education level.

249,Gatchalian has high hopes for EVOSS,Mario Casayuran,"Apr 29, 2023 ","Senator Sherwin Gatchalian expects the Energy Virtual One-Stop Shop (EVOSS) system to attract investors thanks to a streamlined permitting process aimed at developing more offshore wind (OSW) energy projects in the country.
Gatchalian, vice chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, said the recent issuance of Executive Order (EO) No. 21 would further enhance the implementation of the EVOSS System, which in turn, is expected to clear the way for the development of more renewable energy  (RE) projects, particularly OSWs, as the permitting process of such projects would be simplified significantly.
Specifically, EO 21 mandated the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) to submit to the Department of Energy (DOE) a complete list of appropriate permits required by local government units (LGUs), including the requirements, fees, and procedures, which will then be integrated into the EVOSS platform.
All permitting agencies are directed to ensure the efficient and timely processing of permits. Also, it requires them to follow EVOSS time frames.
Gatchalian said boosting offshore wind power would reduce dependence on imported fuel and speed up energy transition.
‘’This can also promote a more conducive investment environment that will provide jobs and increase economic growth,” he added.
Gatchalian is the principal author of Republic Act (RA) No.11234, or the EVOSS Act.
“The objective of institutionalizing the EVOSS system is to streamline the permitting process of power generation, transmission, and distribution projects or simply, eliminate red tape in the energy sector. We are confident of realizing this objective, making it easier for investors to develop more OSW projects,” he explained.
The Philippine Offshore Wind Roadmap has identified a total technical potential capacity of 178 gigawatts that can be harnessed from offshore wind resources.
The Philippine Energy Plan 2020-2024 targets to increase the RE contribution in the power generation mix from the current share of 22 percent, to 35 percent RE share by 2030, and 50 percent RE share by 2040.

Abarca,"Apr 29, 2023 ","Residents of Eastern Visayas and Caraga were told to be vigilant against possible flash floods or landslides due to moderate to at times heavy rains that the combined effects of easterlies and intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) may bring.
Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) Weather Specialist Rhea Torres on Saturday, April 29, said two weather systems — easterlies and ITCZ — may bring cloudy skies with scattered rain showers and thunderstorms in parts of Visayas and Mindanao.
“Ang panahon natin lalo na sa Visayas at Mindanao, particularly eastern Visayas at Caraga areas, asahan natin na magiging maulan ngayong araw [dahil sa epekto ng ITCZ at easterlies] (Our weather in the Visayas and Mindanao, particularly the eastern Visayas and Caraga areas, we expect it to be rainy today due to the effects of the ITCZ and easterlies),” said Torres in a public weather forecast.
Easterlies are the warm and humid winds from the Pacific Ocean. ITCZ, on the other hand, is a weather system that forms when winds from the northern and southern hemispheres converge.
Although these weather systems may trigger scattered rain showers, PAGASA said Metro Manila and the rest of the country may still expect generally fair and humid weather in the next 24-hour period.
“Patuloy pa rin nating pinapayuhan ang ating mga kababayan na bawasan ang matinding outdoor activities sa dakong 10 a.m. hanggang 4 p.m. dahil yan ang mga oras na nakakarecord tayo ng maximum temperatures (We continue to advise the public to reduce intense outdoor activities from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. because those are the times when we record maximum temperatures),” Torres stressed.
The use of sun protection is strongly advised if sun exposure is unavoidable, the state weather bureau said.

ACT Teachers party-list Rep. France Castro has strongly condemned on Saturday, April 29 what she described as China’s latest attack on the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG).
""Aside from filing a diplomatic protest, steps must be undertaken so that this will not happen again like lobbying the Asian Parliamentary Assembly and the Inter-Parlimentary Union (IPU) to condemn such actions,"" said the Makabayan lawmaker.
Castro made this call as a Chinese coast guard ship cut off a Philippine patrol vessel carrying journalists off the Spratly Islands, causing a near-collision last April 23.
The near-miss occurred amid heightened tension in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) between China and long-time Philippine ally, the United States (US).
But between Manila and Beijing, things haven't been very rosy in the WPS either.
""While its (China) diplomats say that more lines of communication are now available to avoid skirmishes and misunderstanding in the [WPS], their coast guard tried to ram our coast guard and are intent in denying us our own waters,"" claimed Castro, who is a deputy minority leader in the House of Representatives.
""As things go, while China is using its might to force us out of our own territory and exclusive economic zones, the US is exploiting our strategic location to advance its geopolitical agenda to the detriment of Filipinos,"" she said.
""We reiterate that we need to de-escalate the tension and demilitarize the [WPS] instead of further heightening it. Joint patrols and international pressure are the peaceful yet assertive ways to defend our territory, military agreements will just exacerbate the current situation,"" ended Castro.

257,Marcos admin acts on Occidental Mindoro power crisis,Argyll Cyrus Geducos,"Apr 29, 2023 ","The Marcos administration has moved to address the power crisis in Occidental Mindoro with the operation of at least three power stations that will be able to provide 24-hour electricity power service in the province, Communications Secretary Cheloy Garafil said.
######
In a statement, Garafil, citing a report from the National Electrification Administration (NEA), said NEA chief Antonio Mariano Almeda met with Luis Manuel Banzon, owner of Occidental Mindoro Consolidated Power Corporation (OMCPC), last April 27 to discuss the possible measures to remedy the current power crisis.
During the meeting, the two parties agreed to run the three power stations of OMCPC to address the current power supply concerns of the province.
The power stations in the Sablayan area,  which has five megawatts (MW) capacity, are in Mamburao, Paluan, Sta. Cruz, and Abra de Ilog (MAPSA), which has a 7MW capacity; and in San Jose, Magsaysay, Rizal, Calitaan (SAMARICA), which has a 20MW capacity, will be running round-the-clock to provide electricity in the areas.
NEA noted that the peak demand of Occidental Mindoro Electric Cooperative Inc. (OMECO) is at 29 to 30 MW. It added that OMCPC’s three power plants are covered by Power Supply Agreements (PSAs) with OMECO.
The Sablayan and MAPSA PSAs were provisionally approved by Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) while OMCPC is still processing OMCPC’s application for the SAMARICA PSA.
Until recently, the NEA said OMCPC was operating only its SAMARICA power plant at a capacity of about 7.5 MW without running its Sablayan and MAPSA power plants.
In the same April 27 meeting, it was determined that the apparent reason why OMCPC was not operating its Sablayan and MAPSA power plants was due to the issue of whether OMCPC’s fuel cost is a pass-through cost.
Upon the orders of the NEA administrator, OMCPC agreed to run its three power facilities notwithstanding any potential financial losses to Banzon, and despite not having an approved rate from the ERC for the SAMARICA power plant which would allow him to recoup his cost of operations.
Banzon’s decision was driven by his desire to help alleviate the power crisis in the province, the NEA said.
Almeda pointed out that the severe power shortage has significantly and adversely affected the Province’s basic services, such as its public hospitals, placing lives at risk.
To date, there are no reports of blackouts in the Occidental Mindoro, the NEA noted.
Before requesting that OMCPC operate its power stations, the NEA official sought the clearance of Department of Energy Secretary Raphael Lotilla, who greenlit the arrangement.
Banzon, while initially hesitant, agreed to operate the power plants situated, notwithstanding the expected financial losses, to supply residents in the province with electricity.
With all of OMCPC’s power stations running at full capacity, it could supply about 30MW to 32MW of power to OMECO, which should result in the substantial lessening, if not complete elimination, of blackouts in the province, the NEA added.
With the changes in the action plan of the NEA chief, NEA’s Lease and Operate Agreement (LOA) with Power Systems Inc. (PSI) for the operation of the latter’s power plant in the province at a capacity of 5MW will continue to operate though in a reserve capacity.
The NEA also said the intended Emergency Power Supply Agreement (EPSA) with DMCI Power Corporation will not push through, and the modular generators being transported to the provinces originally intended to service its public schools and hospitals will be kept there in case the same should be needed.

258,DepEd releases draft of revised K to 10 curriculum. What’s new this time?,Merlina Hernando-Malipot,"Apr 29, 2023 ","After completing the review of the curriculum for Kinder to Grade 10, the Department of Education (DepEd) released the revised curriculum guide for Kinder to Grade 10 (K to 10) last week.
DepEd Spokesperson Michael Poa said that K to 10 curriculum guide has “been published for comments.”
As per DepEd, the draft of the K to 10 curriculum guide is open for comments until May 3.
Need for revision
As stated in the Shaping Paper released by the Bureau of Curriculum Development, while the implementation of the K to 12 Basic Education Curriculum was considered “one of the most significant educational reforms in the country,” DepEd noted that as with any curricular reform, the K to 12 Program is “not without challenges.”
Citing results of both national and international standardized assessments, DepEd noted that there was “no improvement in the academic performance of Filipino learners.”
Along with the need for basic education institutions to “keep abreast of global future trends while addressing the changing needs and learning challenges of children,” DepEd was prompted to re-examine and enhance the K to 12 curricula to “identify points for improvement to ultimately lift the quality of basic education.”
Based on system assessments, DepEd noted the “many issues and concerns” that it needs to address in English, Filipino, Mother Tongue, and Math. “The results imply the need for more improvements in curriculum and delivery,” DepEd said.
Findings of the K to 12 review
The K to 12 curriculum review was initiated by former Education Secretary Leonor Briones.
DepEd noted that significant findings reveal that the current curriculum has a “substantial number of essential learning competencies, indicating curriculum relevance.”
Based on the findings, it was recommended to “further decongest the curriculum.”
The findings of the review also revealed that “only a few teachers reported having adequate time to teach all learning competencies” which hindered the implementation of the curriculum.
DepEd noted that the study highly recommended “reducing the amount of learning required by the intended curriculum to ensure that all learning competencies can be taught with the required cognitive depth in the time available, and revise the sequencing, clarity of expression, cognitive demand of the learning competencies, and associated grade-level standards to ensure prerequisite skills and knowledge are built systematically from one grade to the next.”
New features of the 2022 curriculum
Among the new features of the revised K to 12 curriculum is to “Focus on the Big Ideas” to emphasize the development and mastery of foundational skills and competencies of learners.
“Focusing on Big Ideas provide transferable concepts to other topics, contexts, or inquiries thereby preventing information overload,” DepEd said.
Another new feature is the “Redesigned Kindergarten Curriculum” to produce young Filipino children who are “holistically developed literates equipped with 21st century skills.”
The new curriculum, DepEd noted, also redefined the interplay among languages in the Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE) and emphasized the engineering design process.
One notable feature of the revised K to 12 curriculum is the introduction of SiKaP (Sibika, Kultura, Kasaysayan, at Kagalingang Pangkatawan) as a learning area.
“The introduction of a new learning area in Key Stage 1 which is SiKaP intends to provide learners with essential knowledge, skills, and attitudes enabling them to develop personal and cultural consciousness in becoming active and creative members of their respective communities,” DepEd said.
Recognizing the need to complement the knowledge and skills development of learners with values development, DepEd said that the new curriculum will also intensify values formation by making it more “holistic as it strikes a balance between competence and character.”
As mandated by RA 11476 or the GMRC and Values Education Law, DepEd said that there will be a separate learning area for values formation in the new curriculum as well as a “systematic integration of DepEd core values across all learning areas with explicit placements in relevant topics and contents in all grade levels.”
What’s in the draft?
In the draft, DepEd released the proposed curriculum guide for K to 10 for learning areas which include Kindergarten, Araling Panlipunan (AP), English, Edukasyong Pantahanan at Pangkabuhayan / Technology and Livelihood Education (EPP-TLE), Filipino, Music, Arts, Physical Education and Health (MAPEH), Mathematics, Science, and Good Manners and Right Conduct (GMRC).
On a closer look, DepEd plans to discuss various “controversial” topics in different grade levels --- particularly in Grade 10.
In the proposed curriculum guide for Grade 10, for instance, DepEd plans to include lessons on the West Philippine Sea (WPS) and the Hague arbitral tribunal ruling in the AP or Social Studies subject.
As seen in the draft, DepEd plans to teach lessons on “Mga Isla ng West Philippine Sea” under “isyung territorial at border conflicts.”
If finalized, the new curriculum will also include a lecture on the ruling of the tribunal in The Hague, the Netherlands where learners are expected to study laws and policies concerning globalization, among others.
As part of lectures on human rights violations, DepEd also proposes the inclusion of lessons on red-tagging, trolling, and extrajudicial killings in the AP of Grade 10.
In the draft of the new curriculum, DepEd is also planning to teach sexual and reproductive health to students as early as Grade 4.
Also in the proposed Grade 10 AP curriculum, DepEd plans to include lessons on gender-related topics such as same-sex union and same-sex marriage and gender-based discrimination.
DepEd is also proposing the removal of the separate Mother Tongue subject at the primary level as well as the early teaching of English among Grade 1 pupils.
SHS review is still ongoing
Meanwhile, DepEd noted that the review of the curriculum for the Grades 11 and 12 Senior High School (SHS) Program is still ongoing.
During the presentation of the Basic Education Report (BER) in January, Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte said that the revised K to 12 curriculum aims to be “more responsive to our aspiration as a nation, to develop lifelong learners who are imbued with 21st-century skills, discipline, and patriotism.”

260,Youth leader receives recognition for community service,Manila Bulletin,"Apr 29, 2023 ","

A Grade 11 student and active youth leader was recently recognized after she conducted a community service program in Las Piñas City.
Patricia Anne D. Arnaiz, 17 and founding chair of Halina Ka-Klase (HKK), implemented HKK’s “One Day, One Community Program” at the Supervised Neighborhood Play (SNP)in Barangay Almanza Dos, Las Piñas City.

“One Day, One Community Program” is the brainchild of Arnaiz, an educational program that enhances the knowledge of young Filipinos in developing communities.
On April 22, 2023, Arnaiz, together with some HKK staff and her ever parents Marlon and Rhea, braved the heat to visit SNP for the implementation of the educational program in coordination with the Rotary Club of Cosmopolitan Las Piñas (RCCLP) and Barangay Almanza Dos.
Around 25 grade two students, aged seven to eight, and classified as stunted children, participated. Stunted children are those who have impairment in growth and development due to poor nutrition and other problems.

HKK Founding Chair Patricia Anne D. Arnaiz or Ate Tricia as term of endearment with “her students” in HKK’s “One Day, One Community Program” in Supervised Neighborhood Play in Barangay Almanza Dos, Las Piñas City.

Arnaiz taught the children different national symbols of the country, the importance of praying before the start of any activity, love and appreciation of the Filipino culture, and others. 
The interaction brought fun to the students but somehow sadness to the eyes of the adults as they witnessed the need for follow up learning activities to further enhance the knowledge of young individuals.
After conducting the class, Arnaiz and the HKK staff distributed modules that will help the young learners gain more knowledge, educational kits, health kits and lunch bags.
Free meals/snacks were also distributed courtesy of HKK and RCLLP.
“I believe that young people like us must take action to help in giving better education to the Filipino children because we are the next generation who will be the instrument to make our country grow, develop and succeed to all plans and programs that will benefit the Philippines in general,” Arnaiz quipped.
Before the activity ended, Arnaiz handed over a big box containing different books to Barangay Almanza Dos Chairperson Mira-Jon DP Alovera.

(Standing from left) Punong Barangay Mira-Jon DP Alovera, HKK Founding Chair Patricia Anne D. Arnaiz and members of Rotary Club of Cosmopolitan Las Piñas proudly show HKK donations to Brgy. Almanza Dos.

261,"'Like father, like son': Marcos excited to reenact dad's 1978 jumpball toss for FIBAWorld Cup 2023",Argyll Cyrus Geducos,"Apr 29, 2023 ","President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. expressed his excitement to ""reenact"" his late father's ceremonial jumpball toss when the Philippines hosted the 1978 International Basketball Federation (FIBA) Basketball World Cup (FBWC), as he welcomed the country's hosting of the much-awaited sporting event in August.
Marcos remembered this during the courtesy call of the members of the FIBA Central Board and delegates from the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) in Malacañang on April 28.
In his remarks, the President recalled how his late father former president Ferdinand Marcos tossed the ceremonial jumpball for the FIBA event 45 years ago, the first time it happened in the Philippines.
""I was there when my father first tossed the ball, and I'm quite pleased to be able to --- I didn't realize that that was the first time that it happened here in the Philippines,"" said Marcos, who was 20 years old then.
""And I'm happy that I will be there for the time that it will --- the FIBA events will return --- World Cup now, will return to the Philippines. So it would be an honor for me to reenact, perhaps, reenact what my father did in 1978,"" he added.
The President said his administration has always considered sports as an essential part of the country's social development and was very happy to support all the endeavors of FIBA's Central committee.
Given the popularity of basketball in the Philippines, Marcos hoped that the Philippines' hosting of the FIBA World Cup would be a success.
On September 12, 2022, FIBA announced that the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia would host the FBWC 2023, the first time multiple Asian nations were selected to host the event.
This is the Philippines' second hosting of the FBWC since 1978.

Meanwhile, Marcos likewise recalled his remarks during the send-off for the Philippine team competing in the 2023 Southeast Asian Games earlier this week, where he highlighted the importance of sports as it is one of the activities suitable to young people.
""When you look at sports and everything that it entails, I said this is one of the very few activities that we can think of from which there really is no downside,"" he said.
""It's good for our discipline. It's good for our health. It's good for our learning camaraderie, learning how to be a good sport,"" he added.
President Marcos also thanked FIBA and SBP Chairman Emeritus and FIBA member Manuel Pangilinan, saying the country's FIBA event would not be possible ""without a great deal of hard work from all of you.""
The SBP is FBWC 2023's local organizing committee.
Founded in 1932, FIBA is an association of national organizations that governs competition in basketball, with a main office in Mies, Switzerland. It has regional offices in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania.
FIBA oversees the establishment, updating, and amendment of the official basketball rules; establishes the specifications for basketball equipment and facilities and regulations for international and Olympic competitions; appoints international referees; regulates the cross-country transfer of players; and governs and oversees the organization of all international competitions.

Raymond Democrito Mendoza believes that the upcoming meeting between President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. and his American counterpart President Joe Biden will result to more decent jobs for Filipinos.
“Workers are hopeful that the meeting between Presidents Marcos and Biden will intensify focus on the Philippines as a preferred country in which to invest, unlocking export market access to the US and also Europe,” said Mendoza, a deputy speaker in the House of Representatives.
“This is the key to creating new, permanent, and decent jobs,” he noted.
Marcos will fly to the United States (US) this weekend. His meeting with Biden will take place on May 1, which is coincidentally Labor Day.
“President Marcos' leadership in bringing in foreign direct investments (FDIs) should translate to decent jobs. We trust that under his watch, instead of workers who are employed in precarious temporary work, we will have workers who will have security of tenure. Instead of poorly paid, low-end gig jobs, we will have decent jobs with living wages,"" Mendoza said.
As part of the House leadership, the TUCP solon said the Philippine legislature is ""prepared to partner with President Marcos in realizing this vision"".
He echoed the notion that indeed, Marcos, who won the presidency via rare majority vote last year, is the ""best salesman"" to pitch to the world that the Philippines is open for business once again following the ravages of the pandemic.
For his part, TUCP Vice President Luis Corral said of the meeting between the two leaders: “The TUCP looks forward to President Marcos’ meeting with President Biden which coincides with Labor Day and hopes that both Presidents will also discuss the reauthorization of the US Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for the Philippines with a clear stamp of the Biden Administration’s worker-centered trade policy.""

266,"PH, China blame each other over vessels' near-collision incident",Joseph Pedrajas,"Apr 28, 2023 ","The Philippines and China gave contrasting positions over which one was to blame for the recent near-collision involving the Philippine and Chinese vessels in the Ayungin Shoal.
The foreign ministries of both countries aired their respective positions over the dangerous incident less than a day after reports came out—a rapid development of the incident as both sides, previously, would not immediately issue their comments.
China, through its Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning, claimed that ""it was a premeditated and provocative action for the Philippine vessel to barge into the waters of Ren'ai Jiao with journalists on board.""
She also claimed that the group's aim ""was to deliberately find fault and take the opportunity to hype up the incident.""
""The Chinese coast guard vessel safeguarded China's territorial sovereignty and maritime order, in accordance with the law, while taking timely measures to avoid the dangerous approach of Philippine vessels and to avoid a collision,"" Ning said, as reported by Agence France-Presse.
But the Philippines immediately refuted her pronouncement, and asserted that the country had the legal right to patrol the West Philippine Sea, where the Ayungin Shoal is located.
The West Philippine Sea is a part of the bigger South China Sea. The Philippines has the legal right over the West Philippine Sea as it is part of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) as stated in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
""Routine patrols in our own waters can neither be premeditated nor provocative,"" Ma. Teresita Daza, spokesperson of the Department of Foreign Affairs, said.
""It is a legal right that we exercised and will continue to exercise,"" she added.
Developments as far as diplomatic relations between the Philippines and China moved fast right after the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) reported about the dangerous move initiated by China in the Ayungin Shoal on Sunday, April 23.
The PCG said a Chinese vessel, which was three times larger than theirs, blocked the Philippine vessel conducting a routine mission in the waters. The two vessels would have collided had the commander of the Philippine vessel not stopped his ship.
""Our focal person received a call from his Chinese counterpart re[garding] this incident last April 23 at 5:56 pm. Our side informed China that it was a routine patrol and that we have every right to carry out such an activity,"" Daza said.
Similar incidents were also documented on April 19 being committed by China's CCG 5201 and 4202 against the Philippines BRP Malapascua en route to Ayungin Shoal, according to her.
Daza said the DFA was studying its options for its next actions.
Both President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. and Chinese President Xi Jinping have agreed to manage their respective countries' differences over the West Philippine Sea and the South China Sea.
Their foreign ministers and other diplomats have also repeatedly reaffirmed their pronouncements to maintain friendly relations despite disagreement.
But China has continued its aggressive actions in the waters, including dangerous maneuvers, laser pointing, and issuing verbal threats to fishermen, among others.

The HDO prohibits Bantag and Zulueta from leaving the Philippines and it has been encoded into the BI's centralized system.

Immigration officers at all ports nationwide can view the HDO, and they will prevent the suspects from departing without prior court approval if they encounter them at any airport or seaport.
In December 2022, the BI issued a lookout bulletin order directing all immigration officers to closely monitor and report any attempt by Bantag and Zulueta to leave the country to the Department of Justice and the National Bureau of Investigation.

268,Hontiveros slams release of smuggled sugar; insists sugar order a req’t under law,Hannah Torregoza,"Apr 28, 2023 "," 
Senator Risa Hontiveros on Friday, April 28, reiterated her stand that a sugar order is needed before any imports of the commodity can be released to the consuming public.
 
Hontiveros pointed this out as she assailed Malacañang’s release of smuggled sugar in the country, saying government is also a “willing and enthusiastic sponsor and enabler” of sugar smuggling in the Philippines.
 
“From then to now, I stand with our stakeholders from the sugar sector: A sugar order is a requirement under the law. There can be no imports if there are no sugar orders,” Hontiveros said.
 
“An SRA (Sugar Regulatory Administration)  sugar order is our very imperfect instrument  for balancing the welfare of farmers, planters and millers on the one hand and of consumers and food manufacturers, on the other hand who must also rely on imports to augment the limited supply,” she stressed. 
 
“We have been duped again. Not only did illegal supplies of sugar slip through our ports, but the government led the public to believe that it would halt and investigate any contraband,” she lamented.
 
Hontiveros further lamented that lawmakers could have had the opportunity to fully investigate this conspiracy in the sugar fiasco part two. The Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, however, has yet to investigate the continuing controversy.
 
“The President did not sign the assailed sugar order used to cover-up the smuggling operation by Usec. Panganiban and the three importers. But it appears to be very clear  to Undersecretary (Domingo) Panganiban and to all ‘obedient’ officials from Malacanang, SRA and the Bureau of Customs (BOC) that the emperor wants something and his wishes should not be foiled,” she said.
 
“In this fiasco, thousands of tons of sugar arrived in the country with no accompanying sugar order or other permits. However, SRA dubiously ironed out all kinks within the subsequent two months. Additional memos, a pile of clearances, dubious reading of the calendar - all of these were resorted to in order to secure the release of the contraband supply,” she said.
 
“There is no doubt that they are trying to straighten what is crooked. This is legal cover-up at its finest or its most gross, and it has failed miserably. That is why they are afraid of facing us,” she reiterated.

269,Legarda pushes for immediate enactment of Zero Food Waste Act,Mario Casayuran,"Apr 28, 2023 ","Senate President Pro Tempore Loren Legarda has reiterated the importance and urgency of passing Senate Bill 240, or the Zero Food Waste Act of 2022 following a recent report of the Philippine Rice Research Institute's (PhilRice) recent report on the alarming P7.2 billion worth of rice wasted in the Philippines.
""Our country is rich in food resources, yet millions of Filipinos cannot afford three meals daily. The excess edible food supply must be highlighted and utilized to feed the millions of hungry Filipinos,"" she said.
Legarda emphasized that the Zero Food Waste Act of 2022 is a timely response to the country's pressing issue of food waste. She filed this measure last year.
The measure aims to implement a system that will encourage food waste reduction in the Philippines through recycling and redistribution.
In doing so, the bill will mandate a specific government agency to launch the National Zero Food Waste Campaign, raise awareness on this issue, and develop a Food-related Business Waste Reduction Strategy and a Household and Local Government Unit Waste Reduction Strategy.
The Department of Agriculture (DA) said that a shortage of 80,000 metric tons of rice from July to September is expected.
Legarda said she firmly believes that with the food recovery and redistribution network that would be established once the bill is passed, this concern about rice production could also be addressed.
""The Zero Food Waste Act of 2022 is not just about reducing food waste; it is also about promoting sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of food waste. When food is wasted, we not only lose the resources and energy that went into producing it, but we also contribute to producing methane gas that contributes to climate change,"" she explained.
""The issue of food waste will continue to be a problem unless we act on it now,"" she added.

273,Omicron subvariant ‘Arcturus’ could be driving rise in PH’s Covid-19 cases—expert,Analou de Vera,"Apr 28, 2023 ","The presence of the Omicron subvariant XBB.1.16 or Arcturus could be the reason behind the rise in Covid-19 cases in the Philippines, a health expert said on Friday, April 28.
The same trend in cases also happened in the past when the Philippines detected other Covid-19 variants, said infectious disease expert Dr. Rontgene Solante of the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila.
“Our experience with BA.2 in 2022 or 2023, iyong BA.4 and BA.5 na bigla na lang tumataas ang mga kaso and nakitaan na lang natin na pumapasok na pala itong mga variants of concern or mga sublineages ng Omicron (as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 wherein cases suddenly increased when we have detected these variants of concern of these Omicron sublineages),” said Solante during a public briefing.
“So, I would highly expect that this increase, itong mga bahagyang pagtaas ng mga kaso (these slight increases in cases) are driven by the XBB sublineage of the Omicron. Whether it’s the XBB.1.5 or the XBB.1.16 or the other one is the XBB.1.9.1 – these are all variants of interest that there is always a possibility that they can cause increase in the cases among our population,” he added.
Solante noted that the Arcturus subvariant “has a growth advantage” compared to other Omicron subvariants.
“Ibig sabihin, mas mabilis siyang dumapo sa katawan natin because of the mutations doon sa spike protein, so ibig sabihin, mas mataas ang hawaan (This means, it sticks faster in our body because of the mutations in the spike protein, so that means, the transmission is higher),” he added.
However, the Arcturus subvariant does not appear to cause more severe Covid-19, based on the experiences of other countries, said Solante.
“Ang importante lang dito (The only important thing here), I think in those countries na marami ng kasong nakikita (where many cases have been recorded), there were no signals that this virus or this variant of interest ay puwedeng mag-cause ng (can cause) severe Covid. So, most of the cases are only mild,” he said.
A total of 130 new cases of Omicron subvariants were detected in the Philippines, based on the latest Covid-19 biosurveillance report of the Department of Health (DOH).  This was the result of the latest genome sequencing covering the period of April 12 to 19.
The report includes the lone XBB.1.16 from Iloilo province. The DOH previously said that the case was “asymptomatic and has already recovered.”
“From March 2023 onwards, XBB and its sublineages were the most detected variant, comprising 63.06 percent of samples sequenced with assigned lineages, followed by the BA.2.3.20 and its sublineages,” the DOH said.
Of the 130 cases, 82 were classified as XBB (including 33 XBB.1.9.1 cases, 24 XBB.1.5 cases, and one XBB.1.16 case), 30 as BA.2.3.20, 12 as BA.5 (including two BQ.1 cases), three as XBC, and another three as other Omicron sublineages, the DOH said.

274,Villar vows to continue support to Filipino farmers,Hannah Torregoza,"Apr 28, 2023 ","Since Filipino farmers still face challenges that need government intervention to move forward, Senator Cynthia A. Villar said that all her legislations were geared to improve their earnings and standard of living. 
“That is why I made it my goal to uplift the lives of Filipino farmers in every legislations I write,” Villar, chairperson of the Senate committee on food and agriculture, said. 
Villar was the guest speaker during the 29th Hog Convention and Trade Exhibits with the theme: ""The Future of Pork Production: Efficient. Productive. Sustainable.” 
The event held at the SMX Convention Center, Pasay City was sponsored by the National Federation of Hog Farmers Inc. and the Pork Producers Federation of the Phils. Inc. 
In her speech, Villar related that during the  previous years, she had written bills which were passed into law. She said these measures are now benefiting the farmers.
She pointed out that among her priority legislations this 19th Congress is the “Livestock, Poultry and Dairy Development and Competitiveness Act of 2022.’’
“To provide additional support to the livestock, poultry and dairy industry, I am also prioritizing the passage of the “Yellow Corn Industry Development Act of 2022,” she explained.
Both of these bills, she said, are already in the final stages of the Technical Working Group (TWG) by her committee. 
This year’s Hog Convention aims to show the different facets of the pork industry from introducing the basics of pork production to those interested in the industry to providing new insights and best practices that old-timers may not be aware of.
“This three-day event features trade exhibits showcasing the latest in veterinary products, innovative equipment and hog-related services as well as seminars on a variety of topics that can help pork producers elevate their productivity and boost their bottom line,” Villar said.
According to the senator, the hog industry is one of the sectors that was greatly affected by the pandemic.  
This was on top of the spread of African Swine Fever (ASF) that crippled many of our hog raisers, she said..
“But the industry had remained resilient amid the challenges and bounced back. We slowly recovered in 2022 until we entered 2023,” she said.
In 2022, pork inputs has increased to 400,000 MT compared to USDA’s official  data 375,000 MT following the issuance of EO No. 171, Series of 2022.
Villar said that the industry would be better unless ASF recurrence would not be stopped.

275,DepEd’s ‘MATATAG’ Agenda programs receive support from local partners,Merlina Hernando-Malipot,"Apr 28, 2023 ","Local partners expressed support to reinforce the “MATATAG” Agenda programs of the Department of Education (DepEd).
During a consultative meeting at the Central Office early this week, DepEd secured the commitment of its local partner organizations to providing relevant assistance in the realization of the “MATATAG” Agenda.
In January, DepEd launched its “MATATAG” education agenda to set a new direction to resolve challenges in the country’s basic education sector.

The recently-held forum aligned the local partners to the “MATATAG” Agenda and presented the proposed menu of education interventions that can be accomplished through partnerships.
“The MATATAG Agenda is not merely a dream, it is a commitment, so now more than ever, we need your continued collaboration,” DepEd Chief of Staff and Spokesperson Michael Poa said.
Through the consultative meeting, both DepEd and partners discussed the distribution and classification of the programs and projects of the local partners ranging from partiality in regions, grade levels, type of program, and project scope.
The representatives of DepEd local partners discussed their existing programs and their alignment with MATATAG Agenda, while others expressed interest in what additional programs can be added to the roster.
DepEd noted that the new menu of interventions provided the necessary platform for the partners to identify and realign their projects in favor of its new education agenda.
“We do appreciate and we are very much honored for the unwavering efforts, valuable partnership, and our joint objective to achieve the goals towards a Bansang Makabata and Batang Makabansa,” Undersecretary for Finance Annalyn Sevilla said.

278,"In aftermath of 'Amang', Villafuerte asks Senate to pass bill on permanent evacuation centers",Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 28, 2023 ","A House leader is prodding the Senate to speed up passage of its version of the measure calling for the construction of permanent evacuation centers nationwide.
Camarines Sur 2nd district Rep. LRay Villafuerte made this call even as he noted that typhoon ""Amang""--the first typhoon to hit the country this year--drove over 12,000 people from their homes in his native region of Bicol.
""This month points anew to the urgency for the Congress to write new legislation putting up permanent evacuation centers all over the country for people who have been forced to flee their homes by disasters, calamities, floods, storm surges and other severe climate disturbances, as well as fire, and the outbreak of diseases that pose imminent danger to life and property,” he said.
Villafuerte, the majority leader of the powerful Commission on Appointments (CA), said the House of Representatives had already passed House Bill (HB) No.7354 on third and final reading.
Villafuerte's HB No.1091 had been incorporated in HB No.7354 which, according to the veteran lawmaker gives a big say to local executives in identifying and subsequently running these permanent evacuation centers in their respective localities.
Sessions in both the House and the Senate are set to resume on May 8.
Villafuerte, a former three-term Camarines Sur governor, first pushed for the establishment of permanent evacuation centers nationwide after typhoon “Ompong” struck in September 2018.
HB No.7354, whose lead authors include House Speaker Martin Romualdez and Tingog Party-list Reps. Yedda Marie Romualdez and Jude Acidre, tasks the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) to identify with local chief executives the areas to be prioritized in the establishment of the permanent evacuation centers, Villafuerte said.
Once the evacuation centers are put up by the DPWH, the local government units (LGUs) are tasked to operate and maintain them.
“The world’s failure to reverse  climate change is expected to spell stronger and deadlier typhoons and other natural hazards in the years ahead, hence  exacerbating for both the national and LGUs this  recurring challenge of providing interim shelter to hundreds of thousands or even millions of families forced to leave their homes during cyclones, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other calamities,” Villafuerte said.
“And with last year’s return of in-person  academic classes all over the country as part of the post-pandemic ‘new normal’ scenario, there is more pressure  on  the national government and LGUs to immediately house disaster-affected evacuees in shelters other than public schools, so as not to disrupt the back-to-normal teaching mode for our teachers and students,” he added.

Marcos recently mentioned that the mutual defense treaty between both countries needs to evolve, and this will be part of the agenda he will raise with Biden.
""We have to evolve it, it has to evolve dahil nag-e-evolve din, ina-adjust adjust din natin 'yan dahil meron din talagang evolution, may nagbabago din sa sitwasyon na hinaharap natin dito sa South China Sea sa gitna ng mga pangyayari sa Taiwan, sa North Korea (because it is evolving, we need to adjust it because there are evolution here, the situation we are facing in the South China Sea, the situation in Taiwan, North Korea are evolving),"" Marcos said on April 24.
During the pre-departure briefing for his US trip on Friday, April 28, Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Ma. Teresita Daza said the matter would actually be raised but did not mention to what extent.
""The President has come up with a statement that there's a need for partnerships not only with the United States to evolve and it is important because the conditions are changing. There are a lot of challenges that are emerging and to be relevant any partnership has to evolve,"" Daza said.
Daza, however, said that she was not privy as to the terms of specifics as to what direction the agreement would go.
""But in terms of the specifics as to directions I am not privy to specific instructions as to how this will evolve but I do also know that it is a matter of evolving our defense security relations. It is not just the DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs) that will be involved, there are other agencies as well that will be involved in it including the Department of National Defense, National Security Council, and the like,"" the ambassador said.
Daza said while it will actually be part of the discussion, Marcos' second trip to the US will give heavy emphasis on the country's economic agenda.
""The discussions on security and defense is a given, it is something that will actually be raised. But I think for this trip, there will be a heavy emphasis in terms of the economic agenda,"" Daza said.
Various priorities such as agriculture and food security, infrastructure development, renewable energy and clean energy will be some of the sectors that will actually be highlighted during the visit itself, she stressed.
""He will cover various aspects of the relations, it's not just defense and security it will also be a promotion of economic interest and the like,"" Daza said.
""I think what will be underscored also is that while defense and security is very important, economic security is also equally important because if you have economic security, that will also promote political security and vice versa,"" Daza added.

281,CHR conducts own probe on killing of union organizer in Bacolod City,Czarina Nicole Ong Ki,"Apr 28, 2023 ","The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) started its own probe as it condemned the April 24 killing in Bacolod City of Alex Dolorosa, an organizer and paralegal officer of a business process outsourcing (BPO) union, the BPO Industry Employees Network (BIEN).
In a statement, the CHR said its probe is being conducted side by side with the investigation being done by the local authorities in Bacolod City.
Earlier, the Department of Justice (DOJ) had mobilized the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and the National Prosecution Service (NPS) to probe for case build-up on Dolorosa’s killing.
The DOJ had also appealed to the those who have information about the incident, including Dolorosa’s family and friends, “to come forward and share what they have with the Department.”
It said “the DOJ’s Witness Protection Program has already been ordered to protect any person who possess relevant information.”
“If and when the witnesses are assessed and evaluated as eligible for protection, immediate protective custody will be taken,” it added.
The CHR expressed hopes that all the investigations will help increase efforts in bringing the perpetrators to justice and uncovering the motives behind the act of violence.
""We note that the local police is already exploring possible motives, including robbery and other reasons possibly driven by anger due to the inflicted injuries,"" it said.
However, it said BIEN members claimed that Dolorosa’s death is connected to his union work.  It said the union alleged that two of their group’s national members have been charged in “trumped-up complaints.”
The CHR said that it received reports that Dolorosa had been helping out colleagues with four labor cases a few days before his violent death.
Also, it said reports stated that Dolorosa was directly involved in advocacies for labor rights and that his organization had been subjected to surveillance and red-tagging, which they deem as crucial factors to be considered in the investigation.
With the reports, the CHR reiterated its call for the government to create stronger measures in upholding the rights of workers and union members in the country.
""CHR is thus alarmed and compelled to act whenever there are cases of violence and death involving union leaders and workers as part of the country's vulnerable sectors,"" the CHR said.
If not properly addressed, the CHR said the attacks against workers' union officers and members might lead to distrust and tension among workers, employers, and the government.
It stressed the importance of respecting and protecting the rights of all workers, including the right to form and join unions, free from any form of intimidation, harassment, or violence.

The closing ceremony of the 38th iteration of the Balikatan was held at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City.
Maj. Gen. Marvine Licudine, head of the AFP Education, Training, and Doctrine Command (ETDC) and Balikatan exercise director on the Philippine side, congratulated the 17,600 troops from the two countries, which is the largest number of participants since its inception in the 1990s, as they have successfully honed their skills and interoperability in various exercises such as command post, cyber defense, field trainings, and humanitarian assistance.
Now what’s next? Cope Thunder – Philippines 23-1, that’s what.
For the first time after three decades, the Philippine Air Force (PAF) and the United States Air Force (USAF) will revive the Cope Thunder exercises with primary flight operations over Clark Air Force Base in Pampanga. 
The Cope Thunder – Philippines 23-1 will take place from May 1 to 12, according to the US Pacific Air Forces Public Affairs.
Cope Thunder began in the Philippines in 1976 but it had to be stopped after the closure of military bases in Clark and Subic Bay in 1991. The following year, it was moved to the Eielson Air Force Base where it was renamed Red Flag Alaska.
“This is the first iteration of Cope Thunder in the Philippines since 1990. It provides a unique opportunity to integrate forces and improve interoperability between the Philippines and the United States,” the US Pacific Air Forces Public Affairs said.
Approximately 160 USAF service members are expected to fly, maintain, and support more than 12 aircraft from its 35 Fighter Wing, Misawa Air Base, Japan units during the iteration of the exercise. 
During the training, service members from the AFP will exchange tactics, techniques and procedures while improving interoperability with their American counterparts.
Among the aircraft seen to be involved in the exercise are the USAF’s F-16 multirole fighters and the PAF’s FA-50 jet trainers.
“Cope Thunder Philippines is designed to provide bilateral fighter training with the Philippine Air Force and improve combined interoperability,” the US Pacific Air Forces Public Affairs said.

286,DFA tells China: Respect PH rights over West PH Sea,Joseph Pedrajas,"Apr 28, 2023 ","The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Friday urged China to respect the Philippines' rights over the West Philippine Sea and honor the freedom of navigation after a Chinese vessel dangerously blocked a Philippine vessel in the Ayungin Shoal.
Ma. Teresita Daza, DFA spokesperson, issued a statement, where she called out the Chinese move that led to near-collision between vessels of two countries on April 23.
""China Coast Guard vessel No. 5201 came within 50 yards of the BRP Malapascua, blocking the latter’s path and exposing the Philippine vessels’ crew to serious danger,"" she reported.
Similar incidents were also documented on April 19 being committed by China's CCG 5201 and 4202 against the Philippines BRP Malapascua en route to Ayungin Shoal, according to Daza.
""First of all, I would like to emphasize that the Philippines has the legal right to carry out routine maritime patrols in our territorial waters and EEZ (exclusive economic zone). The deployment of the BRP Malabrigo and BRP Malapascua in the West Philippine Sea from April 18 to 24 was one such mission,"" she said.
Daza asserted that the interference committed by China's Coast Guard with the routine patrol ""was totally inconsistent with freedom of navigation.""
She added that ""a number of documented incidents also involved highly dangerous maneuvers that were contrary to standard navigational practices.""
China is bound to honor the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea as it is a signatory of the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea.
The pact obliges China and other signatories from the ASEAN to respect freedom of navigation and overflight as well as self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes.
""We again call on China to respect the Philippines' rights over the West Philippine Sea, as provided by UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea), and refrain from actions that may cause an untoward incident,"" she added.

287,Marcos names new SRA chief,Argyll Cyrus Geducos,"Apr 28, 2023 ","President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. has named Pablo Luis Azcona as the acting administrator and chief executive officer of the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA).
This was announced by the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) through a Facebook post on April 28.
Based on the post, Azcona was appointed on April 20, 2023.
Azcona took over the leadership of the SRA from Agriculture Undersecretary Domingo Panganiban, who served as the SRA's officer-in-charge for a while.
Panganiban took over the helm of the SRA following the resignation of David John Thaddeus Alba as SRA administrator due to health reasons last month. Alba's resignation took effect on April 15.
According to the PCO, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin tried to discourage Alba from quitting the SRA, but his health kept him from doing his job.
President Marcos appointed Alba as acting SRA administrator in August last year after the President rejected Sugar Order No. 4, signed by former members of the Sugar Regulatory Board.
The Department of Agriculture (DA), concurrently headed by Marcos, is the parent agency of the SRA.

288,"PH won't yield to intrusions, illegal actions in West PH Sea — DFA",Joseph Pedrajas,"Apr 28, 2023 ","The Philippine government will not back down from ""intrusions"" and ""illegal actions"" in the West Philippine Sea amid yet another dangerous move committed by China in the Philippine waters.
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) spokesperson Ma. Teresita Daza said Friday that investigation into the near collision between the Philippine and Chinese vessels is already ongoing and an appropriate diplomatic action will then be taken.
This came after a larger Chinese Coast Guard vessel blocked a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessel in the vicinity of the Ayungin Shoal, which is located in the internationally-recognized Philippine waters. The two vessels would have collided had the commanding officer of the PCG vessel not stopped his ship.
""We take note of the PCG incident report that was actually also raised in the media,"" Daza said in a press briefing on Friday.
With a strengthened Philippine-US military alliance that came in response to China's aggression in the waters, Daza believed that Marcos would raise to President Joe Biden in their upcoming meeting that the Philippines is counting on the ""great powers"" to calm the waters.
""We want the waters to be a sea of peace. We are also very wary of possible miscalculation or further escalation of tensions in the region,"" she said.
""Because if it's a sea of peace, security and stability, then the country can grow, then the region can grow and prosper,"" she added.
But Daza asserted that the Philippines will always uphold its sovereignty and safeguard its sovereign rights and interests in the South China Sea, particularly in the West Philippine Sea.
""We will do this through diplomacy, military law enforcement and public diplomatic action,"" she said.
Fighting for the Philippine interests has always been the directive of President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. as far as the West Philippine Sea is concerned, according to Daza.
""If there are intrusions, if there are illegal actions that are undertaken in our waters, we do the necessary action,"" she said.
""And from our perspective, that would mean appropriate diplomatic actions, whether it  be in terms of the issuance of note verbales or if necessary a clarifications or a meeting with concerned parties,"" she added.

289,Health expert highlights importance of vaccine confidence,Analou de Vera,"Apr 28, 2023 ","A health expert urged the government and the private sector to continue to work together to  improve the  public's confidence in vaccines.
“We need confidence when we start immunization. And it is not confidence only among health professionals. We need confidence from all sectors,” said Philippine Foundation for Vaccination Executive Director Dr. Lulu Bravo during the “Health Connect” forum on Friday, April 28.
Based on the recent study of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), “the perception of the importance of vaccines for children declined by about 25 percent in the Philippines.”
False claims about vaccines also affects the public’s perception about this life-saving tool, said Bravo.
“Do not listen to fake news because you will not be able to restore your confidence,” she said.
Ensuring “honesty and transparency” in the vaccination programs is also important, said Bravo.
“Don't let graft and corruption fill the gap that we have to get this restoration of confidence because that really damages the confidence of the people, really damages and destroys the credibility,” she said.
“Please, for our government and even private institutions: honesty is still the best policy,” she added.
Meanwhile, the government must also make sure that the vaccines are accessible to the different areas, especially in “underserved communities,” said Bravo.
“Let's make sure that all vaccines can be accessible, especially to the poor, especially to those who cannot afford the private sector,” she said.
Bravo also asked the local government units (LGUs) to intensify their respective vaccination efforts to prevent possible outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.
“LGUs who are still low in their vaccine coverage, whether it is for children, for senior citizens, whether every age has been accounted for, we need to improve coverage to 90 percent,” she said.
“The LGUs can do that… let's make sure that everybody gets to 90 percent so that we don't get outbreaks from measles, polio, diphtheria, and all those vaccine preventable diseases,” she added.

(MWSS office in Quezon City / File photo via Manila Bulletin)
Engineer Jose Dorado Jr., the Deputy Administrator for Engineering and Technical Operations for MWSS, said the MWSS only appealed to local government units in Metro Manila to pose an ordinance regulating the water supply for certain establishments.
Dorado said among these establishments include golf courses, car wash services, and resorts with swimming pools.
He emphasized that the MWSS doesn't have the mandate to force these firms to shut down.  
“Ang maapektuhan po kasing household dito sa patuloy na operasyon ng car wash kung nasa shortage mode tayo ay nasa 2,000 din po bawat araw (Approximately 2,000 households daily will be affected if car wash establishments will still operate during shortage mode),” Dorado said.
“Sa mga resorts po naman, makakaconserve naman po tayo ng 3,000 household kung saka-sakaling maregulate po ang paggamit po ng tubig ng big consumer natin (In terms of resorts, we can conserve water for approximately 3,000 households if the use of water of our big consumers will be regulated),” Dorado added.
Dorado did not present data as to how many households will be affected if golf courses using big volume of water are not regulated. However, he still included these services as among the top consumers of water in Metro Manila.
Nonetheless, Dorado said the MWSS is encouraging the public to conserve water and report to authorities any leaks in water pipes as this is one of the most common causes of water wastage. (Nicole Magmanlac)

291,"Women’s group: ‘No better way to honor workers than to advance our fight for better living, working conditions’",Charie Mae F. Abarca,"Apr 28, 2023 ","Members of the Women Workers United (WWU) on Friday, April 28, vowed to continue fighting for living wages, decent work, quality public services, and freedom from all forms of violence and exploitation.
In time for the celebration of International Workers’ Memorial Day, women workers aired their demands for wage increase, and regular and secure jobs among others.
“There is no better way to honor and seek justice for workers who have fallen in this struggle than to advance our fight for better living and working conditions and defend the rights and civil liberties of Filipino workers and people,” said WWU on Friday.
The gathering, which was attended by several women workers, also served as a pre-Labor Day activity where leaders stressed the effects of rising inflation to employees, especially women.
“This is especially worse for women workers who receive less pay for similar jobs, and are more vulnerable to lay-offs, contractualization schemes, and other forms of labor flexibilization. Significantly less women are also able to join the labor force, much less participate in unionism or exercise our rights to speak up due to our precarious employment status, the disproportionate responsibilities we shoulder at home and in the family, the discrimination and violence we may face, among others,” the group furthered.
Along with their calls and demands, WWU also urged the national government to refrain from implementing policies that enable attacks on workers’ lives and livelihoods, further the gender wage gap, and intensify the repression of workers’ right to unionize.

292,Senators urge gov’t to review PH policy with China after near-collision in West PH Sea,Hannah Torregoza,"Apr 28, 2023 "," 
Senators on Friday, April 28 crossed party lines to denounce China’s latest intimidation at the West Philippine Sea and call for a review of the country’s national policy towards Beijing.
 
“We must also seriously look into reviewing our national policy towards China. Inaaraw-araw na niya ang pambubully sa ating mga mamamayan. Kailangan may mga polisiya tayong magtitiyak ng tunay na pagdedepensa sa karapatan at kabuhayan nating mga Pilipino (He bullies our citizens every day. We need to have policies that will ensure the true defense of the rights and livelihood of us Filipinos),” Sen. Risa Hontiveros said in a statement.
 
Hontiveros’ statement comes after a Chinese coast guard ship reportedly cut off a Philippine patrol vessel carrying journalists in the disputed Spratly Islands causing a near-collision.
 
Hontiveros said she expects the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) to file a diplomatic protest at once regarding the incident.  
 
“This was just the latest in a continuous, unbroken, and apparently unrepentant string of incidents that China should be accountable for,” she said.
 
“I expect that the DFA will file a diplomatic protest at once. Simultaneously, Malacanang should condemn, in the strongest terms, China’s ceaseless intimidation, torment, and threats. The executive should not wait for an even worse incident in order to finally put its foot down and tell Beijing to cease and desist in this kind of aggressive action,” she reiterated.
 
“At this time, it’s only right to actively and boldly continue in the direction of building bigger alliances. A broader alliance is a better alliance. Let us urgently work on building this bigger coalition of countries who are against China’s misbehavior, who uphold our victory at The Hague, and who want to preserve peace and stability in the region,” she said. 
 
Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III for his part, renewed his call for dialogues among claimant countries in the South China Sea (SCS) in order to prevent the tension from escalating.
 
﻿“(It’s a) very unfortunate incident which all should endeavor to avoid a repeat. This is the reason why those claiming and using parts of the SCS and WPS must come up with some sort of a code of conduct,” Pimentel said.
 
“Otherwise, there will always be incidents like this where one party will appear to be a ‘Goliath’, because it is in reality a giant country, and be labeled as a bully,” he said.
 
“It is to the best interest of all parties to start behaving like civilized, respectful, and reasonable neighbors. Start dialogue. Make concrete gains, no matter how small,” Pimentel further appealed.
 
Meanwhile, Senate President Juan Miguel “Migz” Zubiri said he expects President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. to raise the issue of China’s constant bullying in the region on his official visit to the United States this week.
 
﻿“I wish our President godspeed on his official mission to the United States this week, and I fully support his endeavor to strengthen ties with our number one ally and trading partner, the United States,” Zubiri said also in a separate statement.
 
“In a time where there is so much tension in the region, our nation must look towards our friends who share the values of freedom and democracy as well as respect for each and every nation’s sovereignty,” the Senate chief added.
 
Zubiri said he fully supports the President’s advocacy of creating new partnerships and strengthening old ones with the international community of nations.
 
﻿“We need to strengthen our economic ties with our treaty ally and ask American companies to invest in the Philippines, especially those leaving China and other countries with unstable democracies. It’s now time that the Philippines shines in the international stage,” the Senate leader stressed.
Sen. Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa, for his part, urged the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) to maximize their escape and evasion tactics next time.
 
“That is too much of bullying but what else can we do? Hundreds of diplomatic protests have been raised by our government but were just ignored by China,” Dela Rosa said in a separate statement.
 
“We can not afford to fire the first shot that would trigger a shooting war. My advice to our Coast Guard is to maximize their escape and evasion tactics and remember always that patience is a virtue,” he said.

293,Seaweed wine? Iloilo's new product to generate livelihood for coastal communities - DOST-PCHRD,Dhel Nazario,"Apr 28, 2023 ","Researchers from the Iloilo Science and Technology University (ISATU) have come up with a new wine product as a result of a project focusing on underutilized seaweeds with support from the Department of Science and Technology – Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD).
The project entitled “Assessment of potential health benefits and safety of wines produced from brown, green, and red seaweeds"" aims to create new wine products from underutilized seaweeds found on the coasts of Panay Island/
Led by Hilario S. Taberna Jr., the said project also aims to assess the potential health benefits and safety of wines produced from the target seaweed species: Turbinaria spp., Ulva spp., and Acanthophora spicifera, which are abundant in the coastal towns of San Dionisio, Concepcion, and Estancia in Northern Iloilo.
According to DOST-PCHRD, aside from providing a cheaper and healthier option for the Filipino market, the project is also expected to contribute scientific data on the underutilized seaweed species.
Expected to be completed in December 2023, the project is eyed to add economic value to seaweeds and generate livelihood for the coastal communities.
Promising results were shown by the project, where pure blends of the seaweed wines were found to have higher total phenolic, flavonoid, and tannin contents than commercially available wines.
The seaweed wines developed by the project team have shown favorable results with a pH ranging from 4.0 to 5.0 and alcohol content ranging from 8.2 to 11.4%.
To enhance the taste and odor of the wine, the project also developed formulations with added fruits such as mangoes and pineapples. Currently, the project is still in the process of conducting safety assays prior to conducting sensory evaluation for its consumer acceptability.
“PCHRD’s Functional Food program has been successful in addressing the country’s nutrition and health challenges by supporting the development of innovative food products with health benefits. The seaweed wine project is one of the many projects under this area that explores the health benefits of locally-sourced food products having health advantages beyond their distinctive nutritional benefits,” said PCHRD Executive Director Dr. Jaime C. Montoya.
The Seaweed Wines Project highlights the potential of seaweeds as sources of bioactive compounds and chemical diversity, as well as the importance of supporting research and development initiatives that may benefit not only consumers but also local communities.

294,Army blames CPP-NPA-NDF for soldier’s killing in Occ. Mindoro,Martin Sadongdong,"Apr 28, 2023 ","The Philippine Army’s 2nd Infantry Division (2ID) condemned the Communist Party of the Philippines – New People’s Army – National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) on Thursday, April 27, after a soldier was allegedly killed by rebels in San Jose, Occidental Mindoro.
(Courtesy of 2nd Infantry Division, Philippine Army)
Lt. Col. Hector Estolas, chief of 2ID public affairs office, identified the slain soldier as Private Mayuay Onaw, of the 4th Infantry “Scorpion” Battalion.
According to a military report, Onaw was on his way home to Sitio Danlog after buying construction materials in another village when he was fired upon and held captive by eight fully-armed gunmen last April 25.
Onaw was with six other individuals, including his two children, when the incident occurred.
According to the military, three of the victims managed to escape but Onaw, his two children, and another local were overpowered by the gumen after the shooting incident. The victims were then blindfolded and held by the suspects.
The 2ID said that Onaw’s children and the fourth victim were later released but the soldier was “murdered with his body dumped at the location of the shooting incident.”
The incident came three weeks after the military reported that a certain James Angeles, a Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU) Active Auxiliary (CAA), was stabbed to death by suspected NPA rebels in Brgy. Iriron, Calintaan, Occidental Mindoro on April 3.
Citing “reports,” the 2ID said that an alias Saylo, alleged head of the NPA Regional Operations Command; alias Insay, alleged secretary of the Sub-Regional Military Area (SRMA) 4D; and alias Lino, alleged leader of SRMA 4D’s Platun Serna, were the ones behind Angeles’ death.
“We strongly condemn these atrocious acts of the CPP-NPA-NDF which led to the deaths of our troops,” said Maj. Gen. Roberto Capulong, commander of 2ID.
The 2ID also bared that two CAFGU members and two civilians went missing in Mindoro provinces since January.
 A certain Donald Arieta, a CAFGU member, was reported missing in Brgy. San Vicente, Calapan, Oriental Mindoro on Feb. 10.

“Their combined data should give us, the public, an idea of how many SIMs, postpaid and prepaid, need to be registered,” Romualdez said in a statement Friday, April 28.
He added that telcos should filter their data by discarding inactive SIMs.
Romualdez asked for these figures just days after President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. extended the SIM registration window for another 90 days.
Republic Act (RA) No.11934 or the SIM registration law set the registration period between Dec. 27, 2022 and April 26, 2023.
SIM cards are used to avail of network services on electronic devices such as mobile phones.
Reports said that as of April 23 or three days before the original April 26 registration deadline, only 82.8 million SIM owners have registered.
Of the 82.8 million registrants, 39.9 million signed up with Smart Communications, 37.09 million with Globe Telecom, and 5.79 million with DITO Telecommunity Corp.

297,PAO asks SC to consider public lawyers’ safety,Jeffrey Damicog,"Apr 28, 2023 ","The Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) has expressed concerns over the safety of its lawyers should a provision in the newly launched Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability (CPRA) be implemented by the Supreme Court (SC).
PAO, an independent office attached to the Department of Justice (DOJ), is mandated to provide free legal assistance particularly to indigents persons in filing of cases, mediation, and court trials, and other legal services.
In a letter to Chief Justice Alexander G. Gesmundo, PAO Chief Persida V. Rueda Acosta pointed out Section 21, Canon III of the CPRA which states: “A conflict of interest of any of the lawyers of the Public Attorney’s Office incident to services rendered for the Office shall be imputed only to the said lawyer and the lawyer’s direct supervisor. Such conflict of interest shall not disqualify the rest of the lawyers from the Public Attorney’s Office from representing the affected client, upon full disclosure to the latter and written informed consent.”
Acosta said the provision in Section 21 allows PAO lawyers to be pitted against each other before the courts by representing opposing parties in cases.
She said the provision “puts at risk the life and limb of the handling public attorneys because if things go wrong, clients would have enough reason to suspect that their counsels double-crossed them.”
“There were instances when conflict-of-interest representation was the cause of death of former public attorneys,” Acosta lamented.
She recounted that in Region VII, “a former public attorney who later resigned and became a private practitioner was killed for handling a conflicting case.”
“Another public attorney in Infanta, Quezon who assisted a murder suspect was killed in broad daylight when he became a public prosecutor and handled the conflicting case,” she said.
She cited that based on experience, “PAO clients will never agree for their adversaries to be represented by PAO.”
“Individuals who approach PAO are always in a state of helplessness, hopelessness, and desperation. Because of their dire financial standing and being so lowly in life, they come to the PAO very uncertain and insecure as to whether they will indeed obtain justice and whether their ‘free’ government lawyers will be as loyal, diligent, persistent, and competent as private practitioners.  Conflict-of-interest representation would most definitely add to their doubts and insecurities,” she pointed out.
Pending action on PAO’s plea, Acosta asked the SC that the provision “be temporarily not implemented pending a second look and review by all members of the Supreme Court En Banc on its constitutionality, and determination of whether it is detrimental to the integrity of the justice system, public service and public trust, and safety of the life and limb of public attorneys.”
She said that there are other means indigent persons can get free lawyers.
“Indigents are not left without any option in the very few and far instances when the services of the PAO cannot be availed of,” she said.
She cited Republic Act No. 9999, the Free Legal Assistance Act of 2010, wherein “a private lawyer or professional partnership/firm provides free legal assistance to indigents who cannot secure legal services from the PAO, the Department of Justice (DOJ), or any accredited association of the Supreme Court.”
She also said that in 2021, “the DOJ and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) signed a memorandum of agreement to provide free legal assistance to indigents who cannot be accommodated by the PAO.”
“Further, law schools and universities have legal aid clinics under their Clinical Legal Education Program (A.M. No. 19-03-24-SC),” she added.
Also, she said “there are also existing legal aid non-governmental organizations (NGOs); such as, the Free Legal Assistance Group and the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers.”
On top of representation in court cases, Acosta said that PAO “also assists both contending parties whose cases are not yet pending in court by conducting mediation/conciliation proceedings, as governed by the 2021 Revised PAO Operations Manual.”

298,"US, BARMM launch new RORO services in Mindanao",Joseph Pedrajas,"Apr 28, 2023 ","The government of the United States recently launched roll-on/roll-off (RORO) services in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) to boost the local trade and investment in the island region.
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) supported the regional government in its bid to launch a shipping service to link the Polloc Port in Parang, Maguindanao to Lamitan, Basilan.
There will also be a ferry service that will cut the travel time between Cotabato and Zamboanga by at least six hours and reduce transportation costs by as much as 30 percent, according to the US Embassy in Manila.
USAID assisted in the development of the BARMM RORO shipping service through training its officials and staff on infrastructure development and facilitating a series of multi-stakeholder workshops that enabled private sector support for maritime connectivity in the region.
""Strengthening maritime trade routes and intermodal transport systems will open doors for more trade and investment in the region, including in the tourism industry,"" USAID Philippines Mission Director Ryan Washburn said in a recorded message on April 25, at the launching ceremony held at the Polloc Freeport and Economic Zone.
""Additionally, this route will bring down transport cost of businesses by as much as 20 to 30 percent and reduce wastage of agricultural products that are inevitable if transported by land due to poor road conditions and connectivity,"" he added.
For BARMM Chief Minister Ahod Ebrahim, the initiative is ""a manifestation that the peace accord [between the Philippine government and BARMM] is succeeding.""
BARMM Ministry of Transport and Communications (MoTC) Minister Paisalin Tago said the first leg of the maritime connectivity network will pave the way for more commercial routes, including in Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, and possibly extend beyond the Philippines' borders.
An international shipping company is also exploring the inclusion of Polloc Port in an existing ASEAN RORO network that includes Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, he added.

299,496 Filipinos in Sudan evacuated — DFA,Joseph Pedrajas,"Apr 28, 2023 ","More than half of the 700 registered Filipinos in strife-torn Sudan have been evacuated by the Philippine government during the 72-hour ceasefire there.
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said that as of Friday noon (Manila time), 496 Filipinos were able to get out of the capital city, Khartoum, where the heavy fighting between the Sudanese military and paramilitary forces happened.
A total of 414 Filipino evacuees crossed the Sudanese border to Egypt through the evacuation buses rented by the Philippine embassy.
""Philippine Ambassador to Egypt Ezzedin Tago welcomed 340 Filipinos from Khartoum at the Argeen border this morning after they were cleared by Egyptian authorities for entry,"" the DFA said on Friday.
""There have been delays in the processing at the Egyptian border due to the influx of evacuees,"" it added.
The evacuees' travel time from Khartoum to Argeen, Egypt—their initial stop—was about 24 to 36 hours, including the processing time at the border.
They would then travel for five more hours to the Egyptian city of Aswan before boarding a plane bound for the capital city, Cairo.
Filipino evacuees would either seek temporary shelter in Cairo, where the embassy is located, or fly back to the Philippines.
Initially, the Philippine government struggled to evacuate Filipinos in Khartoum due to scarcity in evacuation buses and whooping rental prices that have reached P1.5 million each.
Meanwhile, 58 Filipinos recently left Khartoum and proceeded to Port Sudan, where they would ride a ship bound for Saudi.
The remaining 24 Filipino evacuees who managed to leave Sudan were now either in Athens, Greece after flying through a Greek military aircraft or in Jeddah, Saudi after riding a Saudi military ship.
""DFA teams in Athens, Jeddah, and at the Egypt-Sudan border have been assisting Filipinos from Khartoum and are making arrangements for their repatriation via the next available flights,"" DFA said.
""Coordination with the governments of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Greece on the safe passage of Filipino evacuees is continuing through the respective Philippine Embassies,"" it added.
Fighting erupted in Khartoum on April 15 due to power struggle between Sudan's military ruler, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and paramilitary leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo.
A total of 340 Filipinos have arrived in Egypt after being evacuated by the Philippine government from strife-torn Sudan.
According to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), 227 overseas Filipinos set foot on Egyptian soil early Friday (Manila time) after crossing the border in Argeen.
They travelled from Khartoum to Egypt for at least 24 hours, including the processing time at the border, through the evacuation buses leased by the Philippine Embassy in Egypt.
They joined the initial number of Filipinos who already left Sudan through its border with Egypt, DFA said.
In total, 494 Filipinos have already left Sudan amid deadly clashes between its military and paramilitary forces, according to DFA.

302,COA unearths ‘irregularities’ in hiring of Pampanga employees,Czarina Nicole Ong Ki,"Apr 28, 2023 ","The Commission on Audit (COA) has discovered alleged irregularities in the hiring by Pampanga provincial officials of employees who lack qualifications and who perform work which are not relevant to their positions.
In its annual audit report, COA said that some of those hired perform functions as personal security guards and caretakers of the officials who hired them.
Citing its findings, COA said that an administrative assistant IV, who is paid by the government P22,000 a month, was assigned as head security at the residence of one department head.
It also said an administrative aide VI with salary of P16,877 a month is serving as a security guard at the private residence of a department head, while an administrative aide III and administrative aide I, with salaries of P14,124.88 and P11,551 a month, respectively, are serving as caretakers of the farm of one provincial board member (PBM).
""Interview further disclosed that the other caretaker/farmer had been with the family of the PBM for 27 years,"" it said.
""Apparently, these employees were not performing any official function for the benefit of the government, but private tasks for the personal benefit of the hiring official, casting doubt on the necessity of their employment and the propriety of salaries paid,"" it also said.
At the same time, COA said that 12 local legislative staff under the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and 13 executive assistants under different offices lack proper training and eligibility to hold their positions.
All 25 of them have a Salary Grade 22, which means they are receiving a monthly salary of P66,800. For Salary Grade 22, the government requires a bachelor's degree in a relevant field and at least three years of experience in a similar post, COA said. However, not one of them held the required credentials, it lamented.
""Based from the documents submitted, it showed that all of the 25 employees were not qualified for the positions based on minimum requirements,"" it said.
Some of them had trainings on web design, while others served as cabin crews and health workers. However, the COA said these past experiences do not match their current employments since ""the functions of the local legislative officers are very technical in nature which include preparations of committee reports, coordination, preparation and dissemination of information or communication, and conduct of research on matters related to the functions of the committee.""
Also, COA said it discovered the practice of nepotism as some PBMs appointed their family members as officials even though their qualifications do not meet the requirements of their positions.
""We respect the elected officials’ right to choose their personal and trusted staff. However, nepotism favors relatives regardless of others or anyone who might be more qualified,"" the COA said.
""With such practice, fairness in the hiring and promotion process in government is compromised. This may degrade the morale of incumbent civil servants and excludes other possibly more qualified individuals from being considered for employment,” it stressed.

303,Hontiveros lauds MIAA move to retain CCTV footage for 90 days,Hannah Torregoza,"Apr 28, 2023 "," 
Senator Risa Hontiveros on Friday, April 28 welcomed the Manila International Airport Authority’s (MIAA) decision to extend the retention period of close-circuit television (CCTV) footage at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) to 90 days from the current 30 days.
 
“It’s about time the Manila International Airport Authority took this necessary action. Buti naman at inaksyunan agad ito (It’s a good thing they immediately took action),” Hontiveros said in a statement.
 
The senator recalled this was one of the problems raised during the Senate Committee on Women and Children’s hearing on human trafficking.
 
“We found out that our airport CCTVs didn’t have enough storage to retain footage that would have been critical to our investigation,” the lawmaker said. 
 
According to Hontiveros, her office just recently learned directly from an Indonesian victiim that he and other Indonesians were tricked into entering the country to scam.
 
She said the witness revealed that he, along with two other Indonesians, was escorted by someone who had access all around the airport. 
 
“Tinulungan pa silang madaling makalagpas sa (They were even assisted to go pass the) immigration counter,” she said.
 
“His testimony could have easily been corroborated, and we would have been closer to exacting accountability, only if we had the CCTV footage available,” she pointed out.
 
Hontiveros reiterated that knowing exactly who goes in and out of the country’s borders is an essential part of national security. 
 
“Ngayon, biktima ng human trafficking ang pinapapasok, baka bukas terorista na (Now, victims of human trafficking are able to enter, tomorrow it could terrorists),” she warned.

The PCG incident management team (ITM) conducted a re-survey of the shoreline in Oriental Mindoro last April 26 where it found out that a total of 6.578 kilometers of shoreline in Pola and 1.785 kilometers in Naujan remain to be contaminated by oil spill in Oriental Mindoro.
The IMT noted that the PCG cleaned a total of 27.531 kms out of 34.109 kms (80.71 percent) of affected shoreline in Pola while 5.305 kilometers out of 7.09 kilometers (74.82 percent) were cleared in Naujan. 
The re-survey covered Barangays Misong, Tagumpay, Puting Caco, Tiguihan, Bayanan, Zone 1 and Zone 2, Batuhan, Calima, Buhay na Tubig, and Bacawan in Pola; and Barangays Masaguing and Herrera in Naujan. 
“The team also declared Barangay Tiguihan, Barangay Zone 1, and Barangay Zone 2 in Pola 100 percent clean,” the PCG IMT stressed.
The shoreline re-survey report was discussed, agreed, and signed by involved multi-agencies from the Shoreline Cleanup Team of the PCG, Department of Environment and Natural Resources-Environmental Management Bureau (DENR-EMB), Fisheries Management Office, and local government unit representatives. 
“The joint team are currently conducting Phase 2 and 3 shoreline cleanup by conducting flushing, pressure washing on hard surfaces for remaining contaminated areas, pebble/cobble washing, and manual cleaning. Remaining oil are left to weather and degrade naturally,” the PCG said.
MT Princess Empress sank off Naujan, Oriental Mindoro on Feb. 28 while carrying 800,000 liters of industrial fuel oil.
Korean aid
Meanwhile, the PCG received various equipment from the South Korean government on Thursday, April 27, to sustain the ongoing clean-up operations in Oriental Mindoro.
Counselor Kwon Soonhyun and Secretary Kim Dosik of the Korean Government personally turned over the donation to Vice Admiral Rolando Lizor Punzalan Jr., PCG deputy commandant for operations.
The equipment included 1,800 boxes of pads sorbents, 200 boxes of snare sorbents, 134 boxes of personal protective equipment (PPE), and 50 packs of solid flotation curtain boom.
""I am in high hopes that we could sustain our established relationship while we promote a safer and more secure maritime environment across the world.  May this also allow us to achieve our shared goals specifically in the maritime sector,"" Punzalan said.

306,Romualdez says OFW families could be finding SIM registration difficult,Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 28, 2023 ","House Speaker Martin Romualdez is worried that families of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) are finding it a challenge to have their subscriber identity module or SIM cards registered.
“I suspect that OFW families in the provinces are finding it difficult to comply with the registration requirement. Some may even be unaware of it,” Romualdez said in a statement Friday, April 28.
""Let us assist [OFWs] and their families to register. Their mobile phones are their principal means of communicating and connecting to each other. The thought that they could instantly make audio-video calls eases the pain of being thousands of miles away from home and from their loved ones,” the Leyte 1st district congressman explained.
He said the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) and the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) should help the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) and telcos inform OFWs and their families of the registration requirement.
Romualdez made this call just days after President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. extended the SIM registration window for another 90 days.
Republic Act (RA) No.11934 or the SIM registration law set the registration period between Dec. 27, 2022 and April 26, 2023.
SIM cards are used to avail of network services on electronic devices such as mobile phones.
The Speaker believes that many OFWs and their families back home here in the country are using unlisted prepaid SIMs because of the convenience of acquiring them.
Romualdez lauded telcos for offering registration assistance and mechanisms for their postpaid and prepaid SIM users to list up.
However, he asked them “to go the extra mile in seeking out people who have bought and used their SIMs and help them to register so they would be able to continue using their cellular phone service"".
“That is to the benefit of the telcos, financially,” he pointed out.
“Let us help millions of Filipinos who have mobile phones, but who still have not registered their SIMs as required by law, to register. Let us make it easier for them to take advantage of the 90-day registration extension granted by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.,” he further said.

(File photo: Manila Bulletin)
Commo. Jay Tarriela, PCG adviser of the Commandant for maritime security and PCG spokesperson for WPS, said BRP Malapascua (MRRV-4402) and BRP Malabrigo (MRRV-4403) were deployed to the WPS from April 18 to 24 upon the orders of PCG Commandant Adm. Artemio Abu and in adherence with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s directive to increase the country’s presence in the Philippine territorial waters.
But on April 21, Tarriela said that a China People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy corvette with bow number 549 confronted the PCG vessels at seven nautical miles from Pag-asa (Thitu) Island.

Pag-asa Island, the largest out of the nine features occupied by the Philippines in the Kalayaan Island Group (Spratly Islands), is located about 480 km from Puerto Princesa City, Palawan.
“The encounter began when the Chinese gray ship challenged the presence of the PCG vessels over the radio and directed them to leave the area. The Chinese navy issued a warning to the PCG, suggesting that failure to comply might ‘cause problem,’” Tarriela said.
Despite this, Tarriela said the PCG vessels “did not back down and responded by asserting their rights” to carry out operations within the territorial sea of Pag-asa Island. 
“They further asked the Chinese navy to leave the area immediately instead,” he added.
Two days later, two Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) vessels identified as CCG 5201 and CCG 4202 intercepted the PCG MRRVs while they were in the vicinity of Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal.

Ayungin Shoal is located at approximately 105 nautical miles (194 km) west of Palawan.
According to Tarriela, CCG vessels 5201 and 4202 “exhibited aggressive tactics” towards BRP Malapascua and BRP Malabrigo. 
(Courtesy of PCG)
He said CCG vessel 5201 was reported to have carried out dangerous maneuvers near BRP Malapascua by maintaining a perilous distance of only 50 yards. Meanwhile, CCG vessel 4202 persistently followed BRP Malabrigo at a distance of 700 yards while closely monitoring its movements.
“This close proximity posed a significant threat to the safety and security of the Philippine vessel and its crew,” Tarriela noted.
Another swarming?
Aside from this, the PCG vessels identified over 100 alleged Chinese maritime militia (CMM) vessels in the different areas of the WPS such as Sabina Shoal, Iroquis Reef, Lawak Island, Patag Island, Likas Island, Parola Island, Pag-asa Island, Tizzard Bank, Julian Felipe Reef, and Ayungin Shoal.

Among these, a notable 18 Chinese maritime militia vessels were detected near Sabina Shoal, an atoll in the Kalayaan Island Group. 
“Despite the numerous radio challenges by the two PCG vessels, the CMM did not respond or comply with the order to leave the area immediately,” Tarriela said.
(Courtesy of PCG)
Meanwhile, four additional CMM vessels “which appeared to be engaged in fishing activities” were successfully driven away by the PCG vessels from the territorial sea of Pag-asa at a distance of four nautical miles. 
There were 17 groups of CMMs that were also observed in the vicinity of Julian Felipe (Whitsun) Reef with an estimated total count of 116 vessels.

In response, the PCG vessels deployed their Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats (RHIB) to disperse the large CMM gathering, according to Tarriela. However, no CMM vessels reacted or made any attempts to vacate the area.
Tarriela said the PCG already submitted a report to the National Task Force West Philippine Sea (NTFWPS) regarding the presence of a Chinese warship, the continued appearance of alleged CMM vessels within the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and the aggressive actions of the CCG against PCG vessels.
“The PCG is dedicated, along with the Western Command (WESCOM) of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), and the Area Task Force - West (ATF-WEST), to diligently and tirelessly work together to protect the Philippines' exclusive sovereign rights in its EEZ, its sovereignty, territory, and continental shelf in the West Philippine Sea,” Tarriela stressed.

The Marina said that the French Embassies in Manila and Singapore invited and facilitated the participation of Marina to the Sea Asia 2023, the leading platform for the maritime industry to interact and explore business opportunities, from April 25 to 27 at the Marina Bay Sands.
“The event provided Marina with the opportunity to explore the latest technological advancements and innovations in the energy transition, efficient operations of ships, and zero carbon marine fuels currently in the market,” the Marina said in a statement on Thursday, April 27.
“The highlight of the mission was Marina's meeting with the French Head of Delegation, Ms. Anne Legregeois, and other officials from the Directorate General of Maritime Affairs, Fisheries and Aquaculture and the French International Register (RIF) Head, Mr. Stephane Garziano. RIF commended the Philippines for providing competent seafarers, with special mention on MARINA's verification system and MISMO (MARINA's Integrated Seafarers Management Online), hailing the said network as 'the best seafarer system they have used so far,'” it added.
During the event, Marina Deputy Administrator for Planning Sonia B. Malaluan participated in a roundtable discussion on decarbonization in ship operations. It was hosted by the French Chamber of Commerce in Singapore, the Embassy of France, and Cluster Maritime Francais.
Key experts from various shipping firms shared insights and best practices on their energy efficient operations of ships, shipping companies’ journey using liquefied natural gas (LNG) without any safety issue, the availability of LNG bunkering vessels, some issues on the use of methanol and ammonia, regulatory policies and safety standards on the use of alternative fuels or sources of energy, and other products/solutions for voyage optimization. 
Malaluan also met with officials of the Ecole National Superieure Maritime (ENSM), the National Maritime University of France, to discuss possible collaboration on areas of maritime education and training for seafarers. 
The event also provided an opportunity for the Marina to meet and invite French companies and organizations to participate in the upcoming PHILMARINE 2023 – the only specialized maritime, shipbuilding, and offshore event in the country – to be held in Manila from June 20 to 22.
“MARINA's participation in Sea Asia 2023 highlights the agency's proactive efforts to promote sustainable development in the Philippine maritime industry and to collaborate with other countries and organizations to address areas of improvement identified by the European Commission (EC) on the country's compliance with the STCW Convention, as amended, as well as seafarers' trainings needed to ensure that seafarers are not left behind as the maritime industry transitions to green shipping,” the agency said.
Last month, the Marina had announced that the EC decided to continue the recognition of Philippine-issued Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) certificates for Filipino seafarers, which saved the jobs of almost 50,000 marine officers working onboard European-flagged vessels.

Costing P3,891,322.68, the project involves the 160-meter long road masonry slope protection work that enticed local and foreign tourists to visit the town’s tourist spots.
Miguel stated that the transportation of agricultural products, other goods and social services using the enhanced Maruaya road has complemented the town’s tourism boom with a faster, safer and easier travel to the business centers not only in Piddig but also to the other adjacent towns in the province.
The project was funded under the General Appropriations Act (GAA) of 2022.

314,Villar bats for use of digital copy of IDs in Gov’t transactions,Mario Casayuran,"Apr 28, 2023 ","Senator Mark Villar, chairman of the Senate trade committee, has filed a bill allowing the use of digital copy of identification cards (IDs) in government transactions.
In filing Senate Bill (SB) 1856, Villar explained that IDs play a significant role in society.
In fact, in the Philippines, a person without a valid government issued ID will have a hard time availing and/or accessing public services (i.e. discount for PWDs and application for new government IDs) or worst will not be able to avail of these services at all, he said.
The former Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Secretary said that in this digital age, almost all Philippine government offices require a person to register in its system before an ID can be acquired.
“While it cannot be argued that physical IDs are still important, it is quite unusual that there is still a need to present physical ID before a person can validly transact with the government especially since the present technology allows immediate presentation/verification of a person’s ID thru photos or scanned digital copy stored in mobile phones or tablets,” Villar lamented.
He emphasized that if daily transactions already allow digital payments, then presenting a digital copy of ID should be allowed during government transactions.
“This is already seen as acceptable when the Philippines allowed presenting digital copy of vaccination cards before entering an establishment during the height of COVID-19 pandemic,” he pointed out.
Villar explained that dispensing the presentation of physical IDs would help ease government transactions.
SB 1856 seeks to allow digital copy of IDs during government transactions except to those that have international application.
This will require all government agencies that issue IDs to provide an electronic mark to the physical IDs in order for verification of said ID be available during transaction, subject to the rules and regulations that the Executive shall issue once this bill is enacted into a law.

“Nananawagan po ako sa ating Department of Budget and Management at sa ating Department of Health. As Chair po ng Committee on Health sa Senado, legislator po ako, mambabatas. Kami po ang nag-aaprub ng budget pero ang nagpapatupad nito ay ang ating Executive Department (I appeal to our DBM and our DOH. As chair of the Senate health committee, as a lawmaker. We approved the budget so the Executive department can implement this),” Go pointed out in an ambush interview in San Jose de Buenavista, Antique recently.
 
“What is due to them, bayaran kaagad (we should immediately pay them),” he urged.
 
According to the United Private Hospital Unions of the Philippines (UPHUP), 20,304 healthcare workers who rendered duty in private hospitals during the pandemic have not yet received their mandated Covid-19 benefits and allowances amounting to P1.94-billion from October 2021 onwards.
 
UPHUP also added that the government has incurred P1,840,742,500 in arrears for the one COVID-19 allowance (OCA); special risk allowance (SRA); health emergency allowance (HEA); and meals, accommodation, and transportation (MAT) benefits for the HCWs.
 
Go emphasized the need to give frontliners due importance since they sacrificed much during the pandemic. 
 
“Alam n’yo, napakaliit lang po ‘yan na halaga katumbas ng sakripisyo ng ating mga frontliners. Bigyan po natin ng importansya ang ating mga frontliners po. Sila po ang nagsakripisyo sa panahon ng pandemya. Hindi po natin mararating ito kung hindi po sa ating mga frontliners (You know, that's a very small amount compared to the sacrifice of our frontliners. Let's give importance to our frontliners. They are the ones who sacrificed during the pandemic. We cannot reach this without our frontliners),” the senator said.
 
Go also pointed out there is P19.962-billion allocated for public health emergency benefits and allowances for healthcare and non-healthcare workers under the 2023 national budget. 
 
The senator also noted there is the P52.962-billion that is unprogrammed. “That means, they will still find funds for this, so I hope that if there is excess revenue collection, immediately give what is due to our healthcare workers. Their sacrifice, poor healthcare workers. The rest of them risked their lives and sacrificed,"" he stressed.
 
Both public and private HCWs are covered by Republic Act 11712 or the law that grants mandatory continuing benefits and allowances to HCWs during the Covid-19 pandemic or other public health emergencies. 
 
Under the law, public and private HCWs are entitled to health emergency allowance for every month of service during a state of public health emergency based on the risk categorization.

316,Marcos vows major improvement at NAIA for easier travel,Argyll Cyrus Geducos,"Apr 28, 2023 ","President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. has renewed his administration's commitment to improving Manila's airport operations to ensure ease of travel to boost the country's tourism sector.
Marcos said this during a meeting with the Private Sector Advisory Council (PSAC) Tourism Sector Group in Malacañang on April 27.
During the meeting, the President acknowledged the challenges at the country's major airports, such as space limitations and insufficient technology in processing travel documents.
In a statement, Malacañang said the officials who met the President told him there were minimal space in the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) terminals and physical space for more immigration counters.
They added that there were also some technical issues with the e-gates handling passports and visas.
""We should put a team specifically to study the technology to study all these proposals to see what it will take for us to be able to… The technology exists, so it's just a question of us adopting,"" Marcos said.
""Please keep monitoring and see how far we'll get, where we're falling behind, where we're doing right,"" he added.
To optimize the transportation experience to and from NAIA, the PSAC proposed several ""quick win"" recommendations, including providing concise and clear transport options for passengers leaving the airports and designating a large dispatch booth with uniformed dispatchers stationed in designated areas for pickups.
Among its medium-term recommendations are:
The Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) said it has been acting on PSAC's recommendations and has established a new website, and accredited taxis to prevent passengers from booking ""colorum"" taxis.
It is also coordinating with transport providers to accept other modes of payment, such as credit card payments, and procurement of additional buses to facilitate inter-terminal transport.
On the proposal to add counters, the Bureau of Immigration (BI) reported that it was planning on procuring 35 additional e-gates in 2023 and 50 more in 2024.
It added that it would submit to the budget department its request for additional plantilla positions.
On the proposal for a 'Green Lane' for repeat travelers, the BI committed to studying the coverage of those qualified as repeat travelers to address security concerns.
The PSAC comprises business leaders and industry experts who provide technical advice to the President in achieving the government's economic objectives, particularly in six key sectors such as agriculture; digital infrastructure; healthcare; infrastructure; jobs generation; and tourism.

317,PBBM wants review of TIEZA's non-operating tourism zones,Argyll Cyrus Geducos,"Apr 28, 2023 ","In an effort to boost the country's tourism sector, President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. has ordered the Department of Tourism (DOT) to assess non-operating tourism zones under the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (TIEZA).
######
Marcos issued the directive during a meeting with the Private Sector Advisory Council (PSAC) Tourism Sector Group in Malacañang Palace on April 27.
In his remarks, the President said he was ""happy"" with the general direction of the country's tourism industry.
""I'm happy that the general direction… that means that we are actually… have already started. There are some very good suggestions,"" Marcos said in response to the updates on PSAC's recommendations and proposals to boost the Philippine tourism industry.
Marcos, however, thought TIEZA's problem seemed to be its non-operating properties.
TIEZA is a government-owned and controlled corporation (GOCC) attached to the DOT. It is responsible for implementing policies and programs of the DOT on the development, promotion, and supervision of tourism projects in the country.
During the meeting, the President and the PSAC explored the best ways forward for TIEZA and how to manage its assets.
The PSAC reported that TIEZA's primary funding source is travel tax collection, which insufficiently supports its project requirements.
Under the Tourism Act of 2009, 50 percent of travel tax goes to TIEZA, and 40 percent is allocated to Higher Education Development Fund to enable the CHED to prioritize tourism-related educational programs and courses. The remaining 10 percent goes to the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA).

As a remedy, PSAC's raised its ""quick wins"" recommendations that include amending the allocation of Travel Tax to grant more funding for TIEZA and expanding the list of priority tourism-related investment activities, among others.
The advisory body's medium- and long-term recommendations include:
On the proposal to grant more allocation for TIEZA from the travel tax, the DOT said the move requires amendments to the law and may not materialize within a year, as eyed by the PSAC.
Responding to the proposal to exclude asset operation from TIEZA's mandate, the tourism GOCC said such function may be transferred to private partners instead.
The Philippines recorded 2.6 million tourist arrivals in 2022, which exceeded the target of 1.7 million.
For this year, the country welcomed 1,138,637 international tourist arrivals as of March 14, or 24 percent of the 4.8-million target for the year.
Comparing the 2028 target to actual pre-pandemic data in 2019, there is a targeted increase of 20.19 percent in tourism revenue, 10.53 percent in tourism employment, 38.55 percent in the number of international arrivals, and 12.61 percent in domestic trips to the country.
The PSAC comprises business leaders and industry experts who provide technical advice to the President in achieving the government's economic objectives, particularly in six key sectors such as agriculture; digital infrastructure; healthcare; infrastructure; jobs generation; and tourism.

######
Marcos made this commitment during his attendance at the 50th anniversary of the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP) at the Manila Polo Club in Makati City on April 27.
With the commemoration of the 30th anniversary of World Press Freedom Day, the President committed to ""work hard"" to ""climb our way up"" in the global press freedom rankings.
""This government will remain committed to ensuring transparency and good governance, freedom of expression and of the press, and the protection of media practitioners and their rights in the practice of their profession,"" he said.
President Marcos likewise cited media's ""instrumental role"" in informing the citizenry, shaping public opinion, and ""even triggering social mobilization and change.""
He urged the press to lead and foster public discussion, truth, credibility, and the rule of law, especially in broadcasting, news reporting, and information dissemination.
Meanwhile, President Marcos credited KBP for fully establishing itself as an ""institution of national significance"" and an ""efficient instrument of public service in Philippine society.""
""Through the years, your brand of public service has been in its advocacy of promoting independence and freedom of broadcast media, responsibility and enhanced public service in broadcasting, and the advancement of innovation and development of Philippine broadcasting,"" he said.
According to Marcos, the KBP has ""maintained its social relevance, acting as a uniting and balancing force of broadcast organizations.""
""Throughout the years, the KBP has remained a visible, active, and fair advocate of both rights and obligations of its members and all industry players. You have advocated for freedom, independence, and capacity-building within the industry,"" the President added.

319,PBBM signs EO creating DENR’s water management office amid El Niño threat,Raymund Antonio,"Apr 27, 2023 ","President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has signed an executive order creating the Water Resources Management Office (WRMO) to integrate and harmonize government efforts that will manage Philippine water resources and ensure water supply.
The WRMO is under the supervision of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).
In a statement, Malacañang said Marcos signed EO 22 on Thursday, April 27, mandating the WRMO to “ensure the immediate implementation of the Integrated Water Resources Management in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and formulate a corresponding Water Resources Master Plan (IWMP).”
The EO, which took effect immediately, came on the heels of the looming El Niño phenomenon that threatens the country’s water supply and availability.
The Palace said the EO aims to address the challenges that affect the management of water resources, citing the increasing demand for water due to population and economic growth, impacts of climate change and the pandemic, and the lack of adequate infrastructure leading to uneven distribution of water resources, among others.
An undersecretary will be appointed by the President to the lead the WRMO.
In line with the EO, all water-related agencies will be attached to the DENR, among which are the National Water Resources Board; Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS); Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA), Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA), and the network of local water districts.
These agencies, according to the EO, will have a “collaborative mechanism” under the WRMO to “implement water management programs.”
“To avert water crisis, minimize and avoid conflicts, and consistent with the state’s sole ownership and control over the country’s water resources, it is imperative for the government to integrate and harmonize the policies, programs, and projects of all relevant agencies in the water resource sector in the fulfillment of their complementary governmental mandates,” it read.
Such office is also responsible to “shepherd and champion, together with the Presidential Legislative Liaison Office, the passage of a law creating an apex body such as the proposed Department of Water and/or a regulatory commission on water.”
It is also directed to integrate into the IWMP the various plans of agencies, which include the Philippine Development Plan, the Philippine Water Supply and Sanitation Master Plan, and the National Water Resources Board Security Master Plan.
The WRMO is further tasked to “generate and maintain credible and timely water and sanitation data to aid in evidence-based policy-making, regulations, planning, and implementation.”

OCTA Research fellow Dr. Guido David reported on Thursday, April 27, that Metro Manila's seven-day positivity rate increased from 8.4 percent on April 19 to 13.4 percent on April 26.
Moreover, he does not completely rule out the possibility that Metro Manila's Covid-19 positivity rate will continue to rise in the days to come.
“This is expected to increase further, perhaps up to 20 percent,” David said.
The OCTA fellow previously stated that the Covid-19 Omicron subvariant XBB.1.16 spreading in the country may be the cause of the increasing Covid-19 cases.
Positivity rate refers to the number of individuals who yielded positive results from among those who have been tested for Covid-19.
The benchmark for the positivity rate set by the World Health Organization is 5 percent.
On Thursday, the Department of Health announced 781 new Covid-19 cases across the country.

323,"Keep an eye on electric fan prices, Roman tells DTI",Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 27, 2023 ","Are electric fans going up in price along with temperatures this summer?
They shouldn't be, according to Bataan 1st district Rep. Geraldine Roman.
Roman on Thursday, April 27 asked the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to monitor the prices of electric fans and other heat-reducing agents that are on high demand during the summer.
This, as some consumers cited a substantial increase in the prices of standard stand fans and wall fans. This has added to Filipinos' burden, the solon said.
""Ang electric fan dapat ang pinakamurang pamatid init na abot kaya kahit ng mga pamilyang Pinoy na salat sa yaman. Hindi dapat mabutas ang kanilang mga bulsa para lang makaramdam ng kaginhawaan ngayong panahon ng tag-init (The electric fan is supposed to be the cheapest anti-heat device that even poor Filipinos are able to afford. They shouldn't be burdened just to feel a bit of relief this summer),"" said Roman.
The veteran lawmaker suggested that concerned agencies, including the DTI, should have a discussion with appliance makers about the reported price hikes on electric fans.
“Kung ‘di mababantayan ang presyo niyan, baka liparin na tayong lahat dahil hindi na makayang bilhin (If we can't mitigate those prices, then we might as well all go away since we can't afford it),” said the chairperson of the House Committee on Women and Gender Equality.
Roman noted that the searing weather shouldn't be brushed aside, especially after some students in Occidental Mindoro collapsed due to the extreme heat, and a vendor in Isabela even died from it.
""Nakababahala na may mga kababayan tayong nanganganib ang buhay dahil dito. Kailangang tratuhin na ito bilang seryosong problema na dapat solusyunan ng mga ahensyang may sakop nito (It's concerning that some of our countrymen's lives are in danger because of this. We need to treat this as a serious problem that should be solved by the concerned agencies),"" she said.

325,"Follow int'l standards vs biosafety threats, Salceda tells DA amid livestock concerns",Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The Department of Agriculture (DA) ought to establish stronger mechanisms to detect and contain new and more dangerous strains of African Swine Fever (ASF) and Avian Influenza from coming into the country by setting up stronger first border systems.
Thus, said Albay 2nd district Rep. Joey Salceda in a statement on Thursday, April 27 in response to concerns raised by the United Broiler Raisers Association (UBRA).
According to UBRA members, government is conducting biosafety inspection not at the port of entry, but in cold storages.
“By then, the threat is in. So, I strongly urge the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) to follow international standards and conduct first border inspections at the port of entry, not when the imports are already inside the country’s storage facilities,"" Salceda said.
The BAI is an attached agency of the DA, which is headed by President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.
“We also need stronger mechanisms to detect and contain Avian Flu. This one’s deadly and potentially zoonotic. When it passes on to humans, mortality is 56 percent. And it has so far killed off wild birds at a rate that the world has never seen in any past strain,"" said the Bicolano.
""So, this one could have catastrophic impacts on Philippine agriculture if we don’t get it right. It could also be a public health crisis in the waiting,"" he added.
Salceda, the chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, suggested as a ""first step"" the creation of an inter-agency body to combat such threats to livestock and possibly, humans.
“I strongly urge that just as we have an IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force) on emerging infectious diseases for humans, PBBM issue an executive order monitoring emerging agricultural biosafety threats. I think that’s the first step,"" he said.
Salceda was the guest speaker during the general membership meeting of UBRA--one of the largest poultry-sector organizations in the country--last April 26.

Speaking at the 50th anniversary of the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP) on Thursday night, April 27, Marcos recognized that the media industry has been facing various issues such as the challenge of ensuring the integrity
and credibility of information.
""Well, we started with mistaken information, then it became more active, disinformation, and misinformation and now, out-and-out, fake news,"" Marcos said.
He said these are among the negative effects of technological advancement and the social media age.
""However, it is something that is to be expected considering how powerful the tool social media has become,"" he further said.
""And like any powerful tool, it cuts both ways. And it is up once again to the KBP to bring a measure of stability, a measure of objectivity, to help our people discern what is the real information and what is propaganda,"" he added.
The President said in this situation, the fourth estate stands as ""the stalwart partner of our conscientious and peace-loving citizenry, also of our legitimate and equally conscientious government.""
He stressed that the press and broadcast media are instrumental in informing the citizenry, in shaping public opinion, and triggering social mobilization and change.
""Therefore, I exhort the KBP to continue your very important work with our people and with the government, addressing and remedying the issues and challenges that we face,"" he said.
""Take the lead and foster public discussion, truth and credibility, the rule of law, especially in the practice of broadcasting, news reporting and information-dissemination,"" he added.

He also vowed that the government will work hand in hand with the press  to improve the Philippines' ranking in the World Press Freedom Index, where the country sits at 147th place.
""Onward to many more decades of important and relevant existence, may you genuinely dedicate them to upholding the truth, freedom, and social justice for the benefit and upliftment of the present and of succeeding generations of Filipinos,"" he said.

328,'Naranasan ko po yan': Bosita blows lid off PNP 'quota system' during Duterte’s drug war,Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 27, 2023 ","Did policeman-turned-lawmaker Rep. Bonifacio Bosita of 1-Rider Party-list casually admit that a ""quota system"" was implemented in the Philippine National Police (PNP) during the time of former president Rodrigo Duterte?
It sounds like it, based on his statements during the House Committee on Public Order's hearing on Thursday, April 27.
Antipolo City 2nd district Rep. Romeo Acop chairs the committee, which discussed on Thursday a drug buy-bust case in Antipolo City that had tell-tale signs of police abuse.
In his interpellation during the hearing, Bosita narrated his ""personal experience"" on he was relieved from his post as police station commander after he supposedly failed to fulfill a quota requirement in connection with the previous administration's anti-illegal drug campaign.
“In fairness dito sa ating mga kapatid na police personnel, eh naniniwala ako, itong mga ‘to ay sumusunod lang. Meron kasi Mr. Chair na quota eh during my [time], naranasan ko po ‘yan (In fairness to our police brethren here, I believe that they are merely following orders. Mr. Chair, there was a quota during my time, I experienced it myself),"" he said.
As a station commander, Bosita said that he was given a drug watch list with 21 names on it.
He said he managed to convince 20 of the personalities to surrender in less than a week's time. But despite this, he was still sacked.
“Bumilang lang ng ilang araw nasibak ako sa pwesto (I counted mere days and I was removed fromy my post)...Kapag ikaw ay chief of police at hindi mo na-meet yung quota, parang ang ramdam mo anytime mare-relieve ka na eh (If you're the chief of police and you didn't meet the quota, you kind of feel like anytime you'll get relieved),"" Bosita recounted.
He also shared to the panel how he made 20 people surrender so quickly.
“Nakipag-meet ako sa kanila, sinabi ko na mas makakaganda na i-surrender nila yung kanilang kapamilya na sinasabing involve sa illegal drugs (I met with their families, I told them that it would be better if they turned in their relatives who were involved with illegal drugs).
""May magandang programa si Gen. [Ronald] Bato [dela Rosa], then Chief PNP, na kapag nag-surrender ka mag-undergo ka ang seminar being conducted by pastors or religious leaders…tatanggalin ka sa watchlist (Gen. Bato, then Chief PNP, had a good program wherein surrenderees were made to undergo seminars being conducted by pastors or religious leaders...you will be removed from the watchlist),” Bosita said.
However, the 1-Rider solon said that a senior officer told him afterward that he was relieved because “mahina ka, pina-surrender mo lang yung 20 (you're weak, you merely had the 20 people surrender)"".
Dela Rosa, now a senator, served as the first PNP chief under the previous Duterte administration.
Bosita's Wikipedia page says he is ""a former police officer who was part of the Highway Patrol Group of the [PNP]. He was also Public Information Office Chief of the Cavite office of the PNP.""
He said he retired from the service early because of the quota system.

329,"Hold departure order issued vs Bantag, Zulueta",Jeffrey Damicog,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The Muntinlupa City regional trial court (RTC) has issued a hold departure order (HDO) against former Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) director general Gerald Q. Bantag who has been charged with two murder cases.
The HDO will be served to all airports and seaports to prevent the departure of Bantag and his co-accused, former BuCor security officer Ricardo S. Zulueta.
Both Bantag and Zulueta were charged for the killings of radio broadcaster Percival “Percy Lapid” Mabasa and inmate Cristito Villamor Palana who had been tagged as “middleman” by self-confessed gunman Joel E. Escorial in the killing of the journalist on Oct. 3, 2022.
The murder case in the killing of Percy Lapid had been filed before the Las Pinas City RTC, which, like its counterpart in Muntinlupa City, had issued an arrest order.
The HDO by Muntinlupa City RTC Judge Gener M. Gito was granted on motion by Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutors, DOJ Assistant Secretary Jose Dominic F. Clavano IV said in a statement.
“In order not to frustrate the ends of justice, it is imperative that an order be issued to prevent accused from leaving the country during the pendency of the instant case,” said Judge Gito in his order.
“The issuance of hold-departure orders is an exercise of the court’s inherent power to preserve and maintain the effectiveness of its jurisdiction over the case and the person of the accused,” Judge Gito also said.
“It is an exercise of judicial power which belongs to the court alone,” he added.
Since the filing of the murder cases and the issuance of arrest orders, nothing has been heard from Zulueta.
In the case of Bantag, however, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin C. Remulla said that the former BuCor official had intimated his desire to surrender as confided by Bantag, himself, to a Cabinet member.
But nothing has been heard from Bantag since then, Remulla said.
Remulla said if Bantag surrenders or is arrested, he will be detained at the Custodial Center of the Philippine National Police (PNP) in Camp Crame in Quezon City.
He said the DOJ will give Bantag a few more days “to show up if ever he wants to surrender.”
“Otherwise, we will start clamping down. We will start the effort to arrest him,” he warned.

330,Group reiterates call to junk K to 12 program,Merlina Hernando-Malipot,"Apr 27, 2023 ","A group of education workers on Thursday, April 27, reiterated its call to scrap the K to 12 program and pushed for a basic education curriculum that would address the learning crisis in the country.
“There is no point in continuing a program that not a single study has found to be effective,” said Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) chairperson Vladimer Quetua in a statement.
ACT reiterated its call to scrap the K-to-12 program following the proposal of former president and Pampanga Representative Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's to replace the current K-to-12 program with the “K+10+2” system.

https://mb.com.ph/2023/4/26/arroyo-wants-to-replace-k-to-12-with-k-10-2-find-out-more
“Making Grade 11 and 12 voluntary is essentially an admission that the K-12 program is a failure,” ACT said, reacting to Macapagal-Arroyo's proposal on the K to 12 program.
Since its inception, ACT said that it has called for the junking of the K to 12 program as it is “not designed to bolster a genuine national development program and only aims to produce cheap and docile labor force for foreign employers that is bound to be underpaid, contractual or unemployed.”
ACT also noted that the K to 12 program would also “worsen the perennial shortages in education, a waste of resources, and an added burden to learners, parents and teachers alike.”
If the K to 12 program was junked, ACT said that Grade 11 and 12 teachers are “better absorbed” in the Junior High School. It added that Senior High Schools can also be converted to junior high schools to help “address the teacher and classroom shortage and enable the reduction of class size to manageable levels.”
Meanwhile, ACT said that the Basic Education curriculum should also be “overhauled to address the learning crisis and reorient it towards the objectives of national industrialization.”

331,"DOJ orders probe, case build-up on killing of union organizer in Bacolod City",Jeffrey Damicog,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and the National Prosecution Service (NPS) have been ordered to probe for case build-up on the killing of a union organizer for employees in the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry.
In a statement, the Department of Justice (DOJ) condemned the violent murder of Alex Dolorosa, union organizer and paralegal of BPO Industry Employees Network (BIEN).  He was found dead last April 24 with 20 stab wounds in Bacolod City in Negros Occidental.
The DOJ assured “an extensive and full-blown investigation on the murder.”
“To this end, instructions have been cascaded to the National Bureau of Investigation and the National Prosecution Service to begin their investigation and case build-up so that the appropriate criminal cases may be filed in court,” it said.
It also said that Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin C. Remulla has also “initiated coordination efforts with the local government of Bacolod City through Mayor Alfredo B. Benitez for any relevant information they may possess.”
“The faithful cooperation and coordination of the Philippine National Police is requested to assist in the investigation,” it said.
At the same time, the DOJ appealed to the those who have information about the incident, including Dolorosa’s family and friends, “to come forward and share what they have with the Department.”
It said “the DOJ’s Witness Protection Program has already been ordered to protect any person who possess relevant information.”
“If and when the witnesses are assessed and evaluated as eligible for protection, immediate protective custody will be taken,” it added.

332,State-run banks to expand credit program for agribusiness,Raymund Antonio,"Apr 27, 2023 ","President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. revealed the readiness of state-run banks Landbank and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) to expand their credit coverages to agriculture.
He shared this with Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion, big-brother agriculture companies, and relevant government agencies when he met with them on Tuesday, April 25, at the Malacañang Palace.
The meeting took place to give the Chief Executive an update on Go Negosyo’s Kapatid Angat Lahat Agri Program (KALAP).
“The President, for his part, assured the group during the meeting that he will look into each industry concern in detail separately,” a statement from Go Negosyo said.
The President made such assurances after the group discussed with him the need for interventions in ensuring that farmers get access to credit, an issue that cropped up after earlier consultations with banks and financial institutions on agriculture lending.
“KALAP needs scale. The five hectares that the small farmers have now is not competitive. At the same time, banks can’t lend to them because the lands cannot be collateralized per agrarian reform law,” Concepcion said in an interview.
“While right now, there are workarounds by the big-brother companies as they work with groups of small farmers, we need to think about longer term solutions,” he added.
Marcos also vowed to look into the use of digitalization in farm management as started by Universal Leaf Philippines (ULPI) in the tobacco industry.
This was after ULPI President Winston Uy shared during the meeting the technology they use in tobacco farming, and his intention to share it with other big-brother companies as one of the tools they can use under KALAP.
Other big-brother companies also presented to the President their models that can be used for KALAP.
Aside from Uy, there was James Amparo, who shared Yovel East’s model for rice farming, Christian Moeller for coconut, Simon Bakker for cacao, Kais Marzouki for coffee, and Nando Cojuangco for sugar.
Under the Kalap program, which is a public-private sector initiative that aims to bridge small farmers and large agribusiness companies, small farmers would be incorporated into the value chain of large agribusiness companies or big-brother companies.

333,COA assails Pampanga provincial gov’t for ‘failure to put to good use’ donated construction materials,Czarina Nicole Ong Ki,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The Commission on Audit (COA) has flagged the provincial government of Pampanga for its failure to “put to good use” the construction materials donated when a 6.1 magnitude earthquake hit the province in 2019.
In its audit report, COA also tagged Pampanga for its ""inadequate controls over property management"" and ""deficiencies in the conduct of inventory-taking,"" which resulted in construction materials not being used.  Most of the materials were donated in 2019, it said.
It said the audit team discovered the stored donated materials during an ocular inspection at a compound at Sindalan in San Fernando City on July 7, 2022.
It said the materials were donated by Ayala Corporation when a magnitude 6.1 magnitude earthquake hit the province in April 2019. The construction materials were intended for the construction and rehabilitation of several Aeta houses affected by the earthquake, COA said.
""However, three years have passed and the donated materials remained unutilized,"" it lamented.
""These properties were either stored at the garage, stock room, under hospital beds, or unused corridors,” it said.
It stressed that donated properties should serve their intended purpose, and the receiving units have a responsibility to maximize these.

334,Heat indices in 8 areas stay at ‘danger’ level,Ellalyn De Vera-Ruiz,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The measured heat index in eight locations remained in the ""danger"" category on Thursday, April 27, making it another hot and humid day for Filipinos across the nation.
Based on the monitoring of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), the areas with the highest heat indices observed on Thursday were Dipolog, Zamboanga del Norte (44 degrees Celsius); Guiuan, Eastern Samar (44℃); Roxas City, Capiz (43℃); Zamboanga City, Zamboanga del Sur (43℃); Butuan City, Agusan del Norte (42℃); Dagupan City, Pangasinan (42℃); Masbate City, Masbate (42℃); and Puerto Princesa City, Palawan (42℃).
PAGASA defines the heat index as the measurement of how hot it feels when relative humidity is factored in with the actual air temperature.
It said heat indices between 42°C and 51°C carry impending “danger” as “heat cramps and heat exhaustion are likely” and “heat stroke is probable with continued activity.”

Meanwhile, PAGASA's three monitoring stations in Metro Manila, the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Pasay City, Science Garden in Quezon City, and Port Area in Manila, recorded heat indices of 41°C, 38°C, and 38℃, respectively.
PAGASA said observe “extreme caution” when heat indices reach 32°C to 41°C, as “heat cramps and heat exhaustion are possible” and “continuing activity can result in heatstroke.”
Based on PAGASA’s data, the highest heat index recorded since March 1, 2023, was 49℃ in Guiuan, Eastern Samar on April 16.
In the next 24 hours, PAGASA said the entire country will continue to experience partly cloudy to cloudy weather with isolated rain showers or thunderstorms, mostly in the afternoon or evening.

335,"PNP 'quota system' to boost ICC case vs Duterte, says Makabayan solon",Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 27, 2023 ","A Makabayan lawmaker believes that the alleged ""quota system"" being practiced in the Philippine National Police (PNP) could used as ""evidence"" by the International Criminal Court (ICC) against former president Rodrigo Duterte in connection with the latter's bloody war on drugs.
""Naniniwala ako na ang 'quota system' na ito ay isa mga dahilan sa talamak na extra-judicial killings (EJK) at human rights violations sa panahon ng pekeng drug war ni Duterte (I believe that this quota system is one of the reasons why EJKs and human rights violations were revaluation during Duterte’s fake drug war),"" said ACT Teachers Party-list Rep. France Castro in a statement Thursday, April 27.
Earlier that day, Castro noted that 1-Rider Party-list Rep. Bonifacio Bosita raised during a House Committee on Public Order hearing the notion of a quota system in the police force.
Bosita, a former member of the PNP-Highway Patrol Group (HPG), described the quota system as a minimum number of drug busts per week that is being demanded or required from cops.
""I think that Rep. Bosita's claim can be used to further strengthen the case at the ICC so that those most responsible for the thousands of EJKs would be held accountable,"" said Castro, who is a House deputy minority leader.
The ICC has been eyeing Duterte’s aggressive drive against illegal drugs for quite some time now.
Thousands were believed to have been killed during the former chief executive's anti-narcotics campaign that spanned his entire term from 2016 to 2022. However, the death toll varies greatly depending on who you ask.
The Committee on Public Order tackled on Thursday a drug buy-bust case in Antipolo that had tell-tale signs of police abuse.

336,Revilla to gov’t: Ensure no Filipino is left behind in Sudan,Mario Casayuran,"Apr 27, 2023 ","With the 72-hour ceasefire between the forces in Sudan currently going, the Philippine government should take advantage of such opportunity in evacuating Filipinos in that country.
""We should ensure that no Filipino will be left behind,’’ Senator Ramon ""Bong"" Revilla Jr, said on Thursday, April 27.
""This is our window to secure our people and we cannot afford to waste this chance. At every point during this struggle, every minute is crucial in saving the lives of Filipinos,’’ he said.

337,"NBI to file criminal charges next week vs Rep Teves in killings of Degamo, 8 others – Sec Remulla",Jeffrey Damicog,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) will file before the Department of Justice (DOJ) next week criminal charges against suspended Negros Oriental 3rd District Rep. Arnolfo “Anie” A. Teves Jr. for the March 4 killings of nine persons, one of them Gov. Roel R. Degamo.
“The cases we will be filed next week.  Just to put together a good complaint takes a lot of work,” Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin C. Remulla said on Thursday, April 27.
Teves has been tagged as “mastermind” in the killings. While still abroad, he denied all the allegations against him.
Remulla said that once the cases are filed, Teves will be served the notice at his last known address after a certification from the Bureau of Immigration (BI) that he has not returned.
He said that Teves will be charged with mutiple murder, multiple frustrated murder, multiple attempted murder, and violation of the Republic Act No. 11479, the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020.
“Within the next few days yung technical working group po (of the Anti-Terrorism Council or ATC) iko-convene na ‘yan to receive the evidence para sa appreciation of facts about the designation of the subject persons as terrorists (within the next few days the technical working group will convene to receive and examine the facts on the terrorism case that would be filed),” he said.
“The NBI is actually presenting the documents. Ang NBI kasi may hawak talaga ng criminal investigation (The NBI is the one handling the criminal investigation),” he also said.
Remulla had asked the ATC to have Teves and members of the legislator’s criminal organization designated as “terrorists.”
One of those to be charged with terrorism is Marvin H. Miranda, then bodyguard of the congressman, who was alluded to as the “casting director” in the plot to kill Degamo.
“Meron talagang pattern of killings na nangyari. Takot na takot ang mga tao. Kung ang mga pulis nga di makasalita (There is a pattern of killings in the province. The people are afraid. Even the police can’t even talk),” he said.

338,"VP Duterte tells graduates: Be grateful to your parents, teachers",Raymund Antonio,"Apr 27, 2023 ","Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte asked students of Montessori de San Juan in San Juan City to remain grateful to the people behind their success.
The official said graduates must be thankful to their parents, teachers, friends, and everyone who contributed to their sacrifices.
“I would like to remind our graduates — do not forget to thank the people who have helped you achieve what you have achieved today,” she stressed.
Duterte was the speaker in the commencement exercise and moving up ceremony of Grades 6 and 12 students of the Montessori de San Juan.
The Vice President also encouraged students to have fun while pursuing academic excellence.
“I want to remind you, as you enter high school, that you should be champions in two things: one, you should be champions in having fun. Pangalawa (Second), you should be champions in making sure that you are doing good in school. Matuto kayong maging masaya habang kayo ay pumapasok at nag-aaral (Learn to be happy while you are studying),” she said.
“Make sure that you choose a course or a field that you are happy about,” Duterte added.
The official underscored the importance of ensuring the realization of their dreams, but that would only happen if they would pursue higher education.
As the Vice President was just recently in Pola, Oriental Mindoro, she shared about the difficulties students face coming to school due to various circumstances.
This is one of her goals as Education chief.
“Kami sa Department of Education (DepEd) have been thinking of many ways to make sure na kahit nagtatrabaho ‘yung bata — grade school, high school nagtatrabaho ‘yung bata — we make it possible for them na makapasok sa eskwela (We in the Department of Education have been thinking of many ways to make sure that even if the students are working—grade school, high school the kids are working—we make it possible for them to go to school),” she explained.
Under her leadership, the DepEd has options like blended learning or the Alternative Learning System (ALS) for students to cope with discussions.
“These are just some of the realities facing the Department of Education. They are problems that we are solving through various government interventions and programs with the help of education stakeholders and local government units,” she added.

339,Proposed National Land Use Act moves forward in House,Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 27, 2023 ","Another priority measure of the President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. has moved forward in the House of Representatives.
This, after the House Committee on Land Use approved in a hearing on Thursday, April 27 the substitute bill on the proposed national land use policy seeking to protect irrigated and irrigable lands from conversion.
During the hearing, the technical working group (TWG) headed by Nueva Ecija 3rd district Rep. Ria Vergara presented to the mother committee the substitute bill to House Bill (HB) Nos.420, 870, 1621, 2299, 2383, 2878, 3007, 3611, 3956, 4081, 4163, 4291, 4884, 5149, 6055, 6275, 7092, and 7652, or the proposed National Land Use Act.
The proposed law was identified last year by the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC) as one of the priority measures of the Marcos administration.
Vergara, a vice chairperson of the committee, said the consolidated and as yet unnumbered bill seeks to impose an idle land tax on any person or entity who shall cause any irrigated land within the protected areas for agricultural development to lie idle and unproductive for more than one year.
The idle land tax will be equivalent to 5 percent of the value of the agricultural land based on the real property tax declaration.
The bill likewise seeks to penalize a landowner and designated developer who, without justifiable cause, fails to commence or complete the development of agricultural lands with approved order of conversion.
Individuals initiating, causing, inducing, or abetting illegal conversion will be meted with imprisonment of seven to 12 years and at least a P100,000 fine, the bill said. If the violator is a government official or employee he/she will be dismissed from the service and his/her benefits and entitlements will be forfeited.
The Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (DHSUD) is tasked to penalize local government units (LGUs) that fail to formulate and implement their Comprehensive Land Use Plans (CLUPs).
In the interest of food security, the measure seeks to protect from conversion: 1) prime agricultural lands as defined in the bill; 2) all irrigated and irrigable lands; 3) all lands developed or suitable for high-value crops; and 4) all agricultural lands that are ecologically fragile and whose conversion will lead to serious environmental problems.
The unnumbered bill also creates the National Land Use Commission (NLUC) under the Office of the President. It will take over the powers and responsibilities of the National Land Use Committee.
To be headed by a commissioner, the NLUC shall act as the highest policy-making body on land use and resolve land use policy conflicts between or among agencies, branches, or levels of the government.
The measure is expected to be taken up in plenary once sessions resume on May 8.

340,PNP starts probe into its online recruitment platform over alleged data leak,Aaron Recuenco,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The Philippine National Police (PNP) is now reviewing and assessing its online recruitment application portal amid reports that it became the gateway on the leaks of the police-related data.
PNP chief information officer Col. Redrico Maranan said both the Directorate for Information and Communication Technology (DICTM) and the Anti-Cybercrime Group (ACG) are now conducting assessment to determine if there was an indeed leak of personal information of its personnel as reported by cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler.
“The Anti-Cybercrime Group of the PNP is currently exerting efforts in fast-tracking its internal investigation to determine if there are possible violations of provisions of Republic Act 10173 (Data Privacy Act of 2012),” said Maranan in a statement. 
“Likewise, the Directorate for Information and Communication Technology  is currently conducting an assessment of the systems to determine possible violations or lapses in protocols and procedures,” he added.
In his article, Fowler said over 1.2 million records of employees and applicants with images and documents that include birth certificates, transcript of records, passports and other important documents were exposed.
He said the data include that of the PNP and the National Bureau of Investigation.
But despite the ongoing investigation, the PNP said there was no hacking incident that occurred.
“The PNP reiterates the statement of DICT Secretary John E. Uy that there was no hacking incident, intrusion, or breach on the PNP database and that it is actively coordinating with the said office for parallel investigation,” said Maranan. 
“We assure the public that we are closely collaborating with DICT to ensure the security, safety, and privacy of information in the custody of the PNP to strictly comply with the provisions of the Data Privacy Act.,” he added.

341,"Phivolcs modernization bill to minimize, prevent casualties from natural hazards - DOST",Dhel Nazario,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The top official of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST-PHIVOLCS) stressed the importance of strengthening the monitoring systems and capability of the agency which can help prevent casualties and property losses.
This is why Phivolcs Dir. Teresito C. Bacolcol shared all the data and information that would further justify the urgency of the passage of the DOST-Phivolcs modernization bill during a consultative meeting at the agency's headquarters in Quezon City.
The DOST-PHIVOLCS modernization bill aims to modernize the agency's operations and enhance its ability to provide timely and accurate information, warnings, and recommendations to the public, government agencies, and other concerned stakeholders in the event of natural disasters.
The bill includes allocating funds, which will be around seven billion, for the acquisition and maintenance of state-of-the-art equipment, infrastructure improvement, research and development, and capacity building of DOST-PHIVOLCS personnel.
According to Bacolcol, Phivolcs needs to add more seismic stations in the country to effectively increase the detectability and locate small earthquakes, particularly for faults that exhibit low activity prior to large events. In addition, a denser network would help reveal active faults that have no clear surface expressions.
DOST shared that the country is in the Pacific Ring of Fire, where volcanic eruptions and earthquakes are common.
It added that the country has 24 active and 27 potentially active volcanoes. And out of these 24 active volcanoes, only 10 are being monitored. Moreover, of the 10 monitored active volcanoes only two —Taal and Mayon—have complete monitoring systems.
The human and economic impacts of an insufficiently equipped active volcano are high. Cabalian Volcano, according to DOST, an active volcano located in Southern Leyte, does not have sufficient monitoring instruments. If its activity is not monitored, 240,000 individuals, and 30 airports could be affected by volcanic ash.
Meanwhile, the Philippines also lags in earthquake monitoring, with only 117 seismic stations, while Taiwan, which is one-tenth the size of the Philippines, has 194
On the other hand, for tsunami monitoring, through this modernization bill, DOST-PHIVOLCS plans to establish at least 50 more stations for tsunami detection for coastal communities at risk of tsunamis, develop effective warning systems, and install sensors offshore close to tsunami sources.
Bacolcol also said that 21 out of 24 active volcanoes have incomplete hazard maps, putting at risk 28 provinces. Meanwhile, 27 potentially active volcanoes have incomplete hazard maps, putting 17 provinces at risk. He also emphasized that only 38 of 82 provinces have complete earthquake hazard maps.
“Filipinos would greatly benefit from the passage of this modernization bill. Many of us are aware of the impacts of destructive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Casualties, property losses, all of these will be prevented or minimized if we have adequate monitoring equipment across the country. This will greatly help us formulate policy recommendations and guidance to our LGUs and communities,” explained Bacolcol.
On the other hand, when it comes to the status of the bill, House of Representatives’ S&T Committee Secretary Donald Amado Montes Caballero shared that the DOST-Phivolcs Modernization Bill has already been approved at the committee level.
A substitute bill is being consolidated from the 12 measures presented in the House of Representatives. He explained that after this, it will be referred to the Committee on Ways and Means and to the Committee on Appropriations, after which a committee report will be crafted. The bill will then be presented to the plenary deliberations for the approval of the House of Representatives.
The DOST-PHIVOLCS modernization bill is introduced in Congress by representatives Joey Sarte Salceda, Ron P. Salo, Carlito S. Marquez, Ralph G. Recto, Anna York P. Bondoc, Michael L. Romero, Angelo Marcos Barba, Ferdinand Martin G. Romualdez, Yedda Marie K. Romualdez, Jude A. Acidre, Manuel Jose M. Dalipe, Ferdinand Alexander A. Marcos, Rufus B. Rodriguez, Jurdin Jesus M.

342,Mindoro oil spill’s potential damage to environment at P7B —DENR,Jel Santos,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The oil spill that hit the waters of Oriental MIndoro and other nearby areas has so far caused around P7 billion in environmental damage, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) bared on Thursday, April 27.
“P7 billion is the potential damage [to the environment by the Oriental Mindoro oil spill],” the DENR’s Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB) told reporters.
“The total area extent of the three ecosystems (mangrove areas, seagrass beds, and coral reefs) that fall within the oil spill trajectories across the three provinces is estimated to hold an economic value of around 7 billion,” it continued.
The BMB noted that this estimation includes the overall area of all the three habitats in the affected provinces.
“The actual value of the habitats affected by the spill will rely on ground validation, thorough habitat impact assessments and further economic valuation exercises. This will be determined once the oil spill has been permanently contained and terminated.”
According to the DENR, the P7 billion estimate does not include the P3.8 billion damage to fisheries reported by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).
“As of latest data natin regarding oil spill ang damage to agriculture is more than P3 billion na po. Iyan po ay running hanggang sa may langis na tumatagas pa po ( Per our latest data on the oil spill, the agricultural damage is over P3 billion. That’s the running estimate as long as there is still oil leaking),” Office of Civil Defense (OCD) Joint Information Center chief Diego Agustin Mariano said during a Laging Handa briefing, Thursday.
He said the government is continuously providing assistance to affected fisherfolk in the form of cash and food, among others.
The motor tanker Princess Empress's sinking off the coast of Naujan, Oriental Mindoro, on Feb. 28 caused the oil disaster. Some 800,000 gallons of industrial fuel were being transported by the tanker, per the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG).
As advised  by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR), fishing bans still remain in affected areas in Oriental Mindoro.
In BFAR's Oil Spill Bulletin No. 3 released Wednesday, April 27, the bureau cited results of oil and grease examination in water samples obtained from affected areas in Oriental Mindoro on April 10 showed significant increases in levels from prior analyses.
Earlier, the BFAR said the country’s fisheries sector is losing P5 million per day due to the oil spill.

343,AFP eyes amnesty for Reds amid final push to end communist insurgency,Aaron Recuenco,"Apr 27, 2023 ","Gen. Andres Centino, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), has expressed support for the granting of amnesty to all communist rebels in a bid to finally end the decades-long armed conflict in the country.
In a statement, Centino said there are a number of New People’s Army (NPA) fighters who are discouraged to surrender due to the criminal charges filed against them during the course of their armed struggle.
“Some members of the New People’s Army (NPA) are quite apprehensive about surrendering because of their pending cases in court,” said Centino during his interview on the “Balik-Loob sa Pagbabago” program of Task Force Balik-Loob on Thursday, April 27.
“I have advocated that other approaches of the government in dealing with insurgency should be considered, such as the granting of the amnesty,” he added. 
Based on the military intelligence reports, the strength of the NPA in the country is now only around 2,000—from its peak of over 25,000 during the 1980s.
The same reports disclosed that the NPA fighters in the country are allegedly demoralized due to the vacuum of leadership following the death of Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) founder Jose Maria “Joma” Sison late last year.
The supposed replacements, couple Benito and Wilma Tiamzon, died in the clashes with the military in the Visayas. 
“Their presence is only in a few remaining areas in the country, and that is where our focus is. We are confident that it will not take long before their force is reduced to a minimum,” said Centino.
Since the Duterte administration, the national government opted for localized peace talks through the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC). The agency, however, became controversial over red-tagging allegations.
The localized peace talks is reinforced with Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-CLIP), a reintegration program of government that seeks to effect social healing and national unity through a whole-of-nation approach towards the higher objective of lasting peace.
It provides social equity to former members of the NPA by providing assistance in their reintegration process into mainstream society. 
Centino then encouraged the remaining active members of the armed rebel groups to return to the fold of the law and mainstream society, saying that the AFP has been the catalyst in harnessing the collective efforts of the government and other agencies that aimed to put an end to insurgency in the country. 
He also urged Filipinos to accept the former rebels, also called “friends rescued,” in their community and give them fair treatment and support, so they can easily adjust in their new life back in the mainstream society. 
“By achieving the goal of really creating an environment of enduring peace, I think that will be the victory of the Filipino people. Then we will have progress and development that we, for so long, deserve. With peace, there is progress,” said Centino.
The CPP-NPA has been waging more than five decades of armed struggle against the government, one of the longest in the world. Efforts for peace talks repeatedly bogged down due to differences on the conditions set by the CPP-NPA.

344,"DOH launches ‘Chikiting Ligtas 2023’ immunization drive vs measles, rubella, polio",Analou de Vera,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The Department of Health (DOH) urged parents to let their children get immunized against vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, rubella, and polio as the agency launched a supplemental immunization campaign on Thursday, April 27.
The vaccination campaign called “Chikiting Ligtas 2023: Join the Big Catch Up, Magpabakuna para sa Healthy Pilipinas!” was launched at the FilOil EcoOil Centre in San Juan City, coinciding with the observance of  World Immunization Week. This nationwide immunization activity will run until May 31.
Health Assistant Secretary Beverly Ho said over nine million children aged nine months to 59 months old are eligible to receive the measles-rubella vaccine. Meanwhile, more than 11 million children aged zero to 59 months old are eligible to receive the oral polio vaccine.
“Ang mga health workers natin ay iikot  sa mga barangay at patuloy na magiging bukas po ang mga health centers para magbigay po ng mga bakuna na libre (Our health workers will visit the different vilages and the health centers will continue to be open to give vaccines for free),” said Ho.
The DOH is aiming to attain 95 percent coverage for this program, said DOH Officer-in-Charge and Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.
“Unfortunately, we are seeing a sharp decline in immunization in the last few years. From 87 percent in 2014, our childhood immunization rates went down to 68 percent in 2019. In 2021, the Philippines was among the countries with the highest number of unvaccinated children,” said Vergeire.
“Through your concerted efforts, we can achieve 95 percent immunization coverage of our children and prevent epidemics from happening,” she added.
Vergeire said that “prior to the widespread use of vaccines, getting afflicted with polio is equivalent to getting a life-sentence.” Before, children with polio suffered from paralysis, breathing problems, and even death.
The same goes for those children afflicted with measles and rubella before the vaccine was invented, where some of them suffered from  bleeding, brain swelling, pneumonia, among others, said Vergeire.
“At present, we no longer witness the ill and grave effects of these diseases. This is due to the decades of hard work and perseverance in ensuring that all Filipino children are protected by life-saving vaccines,” she said.
Citing recent data, Ho said about 50,000 measles cases were recorded in 2019, of which 637 died. In the same year, four children died due to ""polio-compatible disease.""
“Measles, rubella, and polio are highly contagious diseases but are also easily preventable through immunization,” said Vergeire.
The vaccines against these diseases are already proven safe and effective, Vergeire reiterated.
“Ang mga bakunang ito ay ligtas, epektibo, at ginagamit na ng iba’t-ibang bansa upang maprotektahan ang kanilang mga kabataan (These vaccines are safe, effective, and are already being used by various countries to protect the young people),” she said.
“These vaccines are made available so that no child or family will suffer from the complications of vaccine-preventable diseases and the high cost that would come with hospitalization,” she added.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) affirmed their commitment to support the routine immunization program of the DOH. This includes “procuring vaccines, deploying additional health staff, engaging with communities to address hesitancy and misinformation, and building cold chain capacities, among others.”
“We call on all local leaders, developmental partners, civil society organizations, and the wider public to join us in this critical effort to restore the protection of Filipino children against vaccine preventable diseases. Let us work together to ensure that no child is left behind and that every child in the Philippines has access to life-saving vaccines,” said WHO Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rui Paulo De Jesus.
“Our appeal to families: your children’s health is too precious to leave to chance. Vaccines are free, safe, and effective in keeping them healthy. By keeping up to date with vaccines, you are giving your children a shot at a brighter future,” he added.

345,"NTC gauging if deactivation of social media access due to unregistered SIMs legally, technically feasible",Charie Mae F. Abarca,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) said they are assessing if it is legally and technically feasible to deactivate services, such as social media access, for those who refuse to register their Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards.
NTC Deputy Commissioner Jon Paulo Salvahan said they are closely coordinating with public telecommunication entities (PTEs) to determine if the proposed measure is feasible.
“We are continuously discussing the legal and technical feasibility of these proposals [with PTEs]. We expect it to [be] released soon, hopefully if not within this week, by next week, we can have a final study or at least a resolution on that matter,” said Salvahan in an interview over CNN Philippines on Wednesday, April 26.
To provide context, Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Secretary Ivan John Uy said they are planning on “incentivizing” the public to register because “some are not taking the deadlines seriously.”
Uy said they will observe the rate of registration during the 90-day extension and after a certain period of time, they will start deactivating SIM card services such as access to Facebook and TikTok accounts. Under this proposal, PTEs will be responsible for “whitelisting” applications or social media services for the unregistered subscribers.
The Republic Act No. 11934, or the SIM Registration Act, states that automatic deactivation of SIMs will happen if an individual fails to comply with the law. It, however, does not state that the government can partially deactivate services within the period of registration.
According to Salvahan, this measure has not been done yet in the Philippines, but it already was implemented in foreign countries.
“As far as I know in the country, it hasn't been done yet, but I think in other countries it’s been done where they deactivate certain social media services. I'm not sure if it's for a particular class of individuals or it's a general implementation, but I’ve seen that in other countries,” Salvahan furthered.

347,SC reiterates ex-Surigao del Sur Rep Pichay’s perpetual ban to hold public office,Rey G. Panaligan,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The Supreme Court (SC) has reiterated its 2021 ruling that upheld the Sandiganbayan’s decision which banned perpetually former Surigao del Sur 1st District Rep. Prospero A. Pichay Jr. from holding public office.
In a press statement, the SC’s public information office (PIO) said the reiteration was contained in the High Court’s April 25 ruling that denied as moot the petition of Mary Elizabeth Ortiga Ty to declare as immediately executory Pichay’s perpetual disqualification to hold public office.
The PIO said the denial on account of mootness was because “of the finality of the Court’s Resolution dated Nov. 11, 2021… which affirmed the decision of the Office of the Ombudsman finding, among others, Pichay Jr. liable under Section 52-A Rule IV of the Uniform Rules on Administrative cases in the Civil Service, and imposing upon him the penalty of dismissal and the accessory penalties of forfeiture of all benefits… and perpetual disqualification to hold any public office.”
It said the SC ruling was written by Justice Maria Filomena D. Singh.
Pichay has been convicted by the Sandiganbayan of three graft charges in connection with the purchase of the Express Savings Bank, Inc. (ESBI) when he was the administrator of the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) in 2009.
Pichay sought re-election in the 1st district of Surigao del Sur last May 9, 2022 local and national elections but he lost.
Also convicted was LWUA Acting Deputy Administrator Wilfredo M. Feleo.
Pichay and Feleo were sentenced to a prison term ranging from 18 to 30 for the three graft charges with perpetual disqualification to hold public office.
But both Pichay and Feleo were acquitted of the charges involving alleged violations of Section X126.2(c)(1)(2) of the Manual of Regulation for Banks in relation to Section 36 and 37 of Republic Act No. 7653 (the New Central Bank Act) for failure of the prosecution to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
The Sandiganbayan has denied Pichay’s motion for reconsideration.
The criminal charges arose from LWUA’s purchase of ESBI, a local thrift bank based in Laguna through WELLEX Group Inc. (WGI) and Forum Pacific Inc. (FPI).
The anti-graft court said that as head of the LWUA board, Pichay approved the acquisition of ESBI even without securing the regulatory approvals from the Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (MB-BSP), the Department of Finance (DOF), and the Office of the President.
""It cannot be denied that accused Pichay and Feleo knew of this requirement as they have been in consultation with the Office of the President, DOF, and BSP. They were specifically advised to secure prior approval of the Monetary Board. This advice was given before LWUA purchased the ESBI shares,"" the court said.
The court said that Pichay and Feleo may not have been impelled by ""patently fraudulent and dishonest purpose,"" since they were merely carrying out a lawful mandate. However, the court pointed out that they carried out the task with ""haphazardness and nonconforming ways.""
""Even assuming that accused did not act in bad faith or with manifest partiality, their negligence under the circumstances was not only gross but also inexcusable,"" the court stressed.
Because the acts of Pichay and Feleo, the court said that LWUA acquired a 60 percent stake of ESBI worth P80 million, made a P300 million deposit in the bank, and a capital infusion worth P400 million.
They were faulted for giving unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference to ESBI owners and corporate and individual stockholders by transferring P780 million of LWUA funds to ESBI to increase the bank's authorized capital stock.
The transfer was made even if the bank had a realized value of negative P12,932,429 as of March 2009. For the years 2005 to 2009, the prosecution said ESBI faced continuous ""substantial net losses and capital deficits.""
The charges against their two co-accused, LWUA Board of Trustees member Enrique S. Montilla III and Acting Administrator Daniel Landingin, had been dismissed on account of their deaths.
The Sandiganbayan’s 66-page decision was written by Associate Justice Lorifel L. Pahimna with the concurrence of Fourth Division Chairperson Alex L. Quiroz and Associate Justice Edgardo M. Caldona.

348,"This solon agrees with Bato, says LGU execs shouldn't pick police chiefs",Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 27, 2023 ","Davao Oriental 2nd district Rep. Cheeno Almario agrees with Senator Ronald ""Bato"" dela Rosa's pronouncement that local government unit (LGUs) officials should be stripped of their appointing powers when it comes their local police chiefs.
“It is best for the PNP (Philippine National Police) to install their choices for provincial directors and chiefs of police based on qualifications and merits to ensure utmost professionalism in their respective performance,"" Almario said in a statement Thursday, April 27.
Almario, a rookie congressman in the current 19th Congress, is a former councilor of Mati City.
Under Section 51 of Republic Act (RA) No.6975, which established the PNP, governors and mayors choose their provincial directors and chiefs of police, respectively, from a list of nominees provided by the PNP.
Almario believes its practicable for the PNP to designate police chiefs based on merit given the measures instituted within the police force to further professionalize their ranks in the past years.
These include the extensive training and stringent process that police personnel take to perform specialized skills and acquire technical knowledge.
Taking into account the series of courses and certification programs police officers must take to qualify for higher-ranking positions, Almario is convinced that this method of career promotion inspires confidence in all levels of the police organization.
He stressed that promotions on the basis of merit and exemplary records will also address the common perception that the appointments to top positions in the PNP are politicized.
Dela Rosa, a former PNP chief, slammed the appointing powers of LGU chiefs during the recent marathon hearings of his Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs, which tackled the alleged impunity in Negros Oriental.

349,DOST pushes for the use of locally-made air quality monitors,Dhel Nazario,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) is pushing for the standard use of air quality monitoring devices (AQMDs) specifically the country's first locally-made one for industries that release high amounts of particulate matter into the air.
This is through the DOST-Philippine Council for Industry Energy and Emerging Technology Research and Development (DOST-PCIEERD) using the Robust Optical Aerosol Monitor or ROAM as a prerequisite for the issuance of the Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC).
“Standardize the use of AQMDs, especially ROAM, in industries that primarily contribute to high concentration of particulate matter by adding it as a pre-requisite before obtaining an ECC from the DENR,"" the brief.
""In addition, the DENR may issue regulatory policies on the proper use, manufacture, fabrication, sale, importation, and exportation of aerosol monitors. Strategies to prevent counterfeit aerosol monitors from penetrating the Philippine market should also be strengthened,” it further mentioned.
DOST PCIEERD Executive Director Dr. Enrico Paringit said the use of technologies such as ROAM in shaping public policy innovates governance as it makes government operations more efficient and effective.
“We hope that government agencies will heed our call to have data-driven, research-based policies and we at DOST PCIEERD will help in carving out these standards
and procedures,” he said.
According to DOST-PCIEERD, ROAM is a technology developed by researchers from the University of the Philippines-Diliman and used to monitor air quality and concentration of particulate matter (PM) in the air.
ROAM makes use of laser illumination and a camera to obtain images of size-selected particles up to PM2.5 to measure PM concentration in the air. In addition, the device is also capable of reading temperature and humidity with at least a five-minute interval.
“It is high time that relevant government agencies put focus and take actions on mitigating the environmental effects of our industries to the health of our citizens. We are certain that that ROAM would make a significant impact on the communities, especially those near high-risk areas,” Paringit said.
Currently, the ROAM project of DOST-PCIEERD was able to locally fabricate 10 units of ROAM around the country. The device has also been employed and tested in a challenging environment in the municipalities of Agoncillo and Alfonso, Batangas for its commercialization, following the eruption of Taal Volcano, on June 12, 2021.
“As a leader and partner in enabling innovations in the Philippines, we enjoin our local government units to collaborate with our researchers in finding solutions in making our air cleaner through technologies brought about by research and development,” Paringit stated.
Compared to other foreign aerosol monitors, ROAM costs significantly less in terms of production and maintenance as it is developed locally. The cost discrepancy does not affect the quality and efficiency compared with other foreign aerosol monitors, as verified by DENR-EMB.
DOST-PCIEERD encourages LGUs to capacitate their local industries to produce the necessary materials to produce ROAM, adopt legal mechanisms, and incorporate the use of ROAM in coal mine industries, as well as promote and commercialize the use of this air monitoring device.
In addition, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources - Environmental Management Bureau (DENR-EMB) may pursue developing local certification and evaluation of aerosol monitors to not be dependent on foreign certifications.

350,"409 Pinoys move out of Khartoum, Sudan as evacuation continues",Raymund Antonio,"Apr 27, 2023 ","At least 409 Filipinos, mostly overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), were evacuated from strife-torn Sudan in Egypt, Malacañang said on Thursday, April 27.
The Palace reported that some 335 OFWs and their family members left Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, on April 26 for Egypt via Wadi Halfa Highway.
The Philippine government has started the evacuation of Filipinos from Sudan as it pushed on mass evacuation efforts amid the fighting there that erupted two weeks ago and resulted to the deaths of 459 people.
On Tuesday, April 25, a three-day ceasefire was declared between the warring factions Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group.
Malacañang said another 35 OFWs and 15 students were brought to safety in Egypt with the help of their fellow Filipinos in Sudan as well as personnel from the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW).
DMW Secretary Susan Ople and Undersecretary Hans Leo Cacdac are now in in Cairo, Egypt, to assist in the government's evacuation efforts. They are likewise leading the distribution of welfare assistance to the Filipino evacuees.
In a recent media briefing, Ople said they were directed by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos to quickly bring all Filipinos out of the hostilities and get them to the Sudan-Egypt border.
Citing a report from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), she said that 327 of the 725 Filipinos, who are now registered in the Philippine Embassy in Cairo sought assistance for repatriation.
“Will the numbers rise? Based on our experience, based on my experience ‘no as an OFW advocate – yes, the possibility is that the numbers will rise,” Ople said.
Meanwhile, the Department of National Defense (DND) continues to closely coordinate with concerned agencies to address the immediate needs of the Filipinos seeking repatriation.
Defense Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said he has already coordinated with the DFA for the repositioning of Defense Attaché from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel to help the Philippine Embassy in Cairo in the evacuation of Filipinos.
The DFA has raised Alert Level 3 in Sudan amid the ongoing political crisis worsened by clashes between two warring factions that broke out in the country last April 15.
""The public is informed that Alert Level 3 (Voluntary Repatriation/Evacuation) has been raised for the whole of the Sudan region due to the ongoing political situation in the country,"" the DFA said in an advisory.

351,Marcos appeals for patience as North-South Commuter Railway project rolls out,Betheena Unite,"Apr 27, 2023 ","As the North-South Commuter Railway (NSCR) rolls out, President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. appealed to the public to be patient over the inconvenience its construction would bring.
Marcos witnessed the ceremonial contract signing between the Department of Transportation and winning bidders for the NSCR Project-South Commuter Section contract packages S-02 and S-03B in Malacañang on Thursday, April 27.
""To our beloved citizens: you remain at the core of all these pursuits.  We are aware of the struggles you encounter daily, and strive hard to address them,"" Marcos said in his speech.
""As a consequence, there will be unavoidable disruptions and inconvenience occasioned by the project’s construction.  So, we ask for your continued patience, your understanding, and set our sights instead on the glory of its accomplishment in a few years’ time,"" he added.
The President said with the signing of the contracts, the third phase of the NSCR system—the South Commuter Section or the South Commuter Railway Project (SCRP)—will soon start.
The contract packages constitute some 14-kilometer stretch of the SCRP, running through Metro Manila, both above and below its surface.
Totaling 55.6 kilometers, the SCRP will connect Manila to Laguna, rounding out the southern leg of the NSCR system.
""In a larger context, this is also an extremely exciting prospect, because it means that all phases of the NSCR system are now officially in full swing,"" Marcos said.
The railway system has a total length of 147.26 kilometers. Marcos said it will be a ""massive boost to our overall transportation infrastructure,"" benefiting up to 800,000 passengers per day.
The construction of the contract packages, on the other hand, is expected to generate more than 2,000 jobs.
""Most importantly, the completion of the full NSCR line will bring greater convenience for our commuters.  It will offer an efficient and comfortable transport alternative that spans the great distance, connecting Pampanga to Manila and then to Laguna,"" Marcos said.
""As a consequence, we expect not only decongestion along our main thoroughfares, especially within Metro Manila, but also faster travel times for commuters in general,"" Marcos added.
Once fully operational in 2029, it will cater to around 800,000 passengers daily and reduce travel time from Clark Airport in Pampanga to Calamba, Laguna in less than two hours.
In his speech, Marcos also acknowledged the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for being the country’s active and consistent partners in infrastructure development for many years now.
He also recognized partner contractors: Acciona- DMCI Joint Venture and the Leighton-First Balfour Joint Venture.
The chief executive also committed that the government ""will be diligent in finishing this project with excellence, with honesty, and with the proper urgency.""

353,Binay urges gov't to step up immunization program for children ASAP,Hannah Torregoza,"Apr 27, 2023 ","Senator Nancy Binay on Thursday, April 27,  called on the Department of Health (DOH) and local government units (LGUs) to come up with concrete strategies and interventions to reduce the number of children who have not received any routine vaccine.
Binay said targeting zero-dose children and improving the routine immunization coverage in barangay- and school-levels is a critical step in reaching out to unvaccinated and vulnerable young population.
The senator made the call following the release of a study by UNICEF ranking the Philippines as 5th ""zero-dose"" country in the world and the second highest in East Asia and the Pacific Region with one million children missing out on routine vaccinations.
By definition, ""zero-dose"" children are those who lack the first dose of the trivalent diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine.
""Sobrang nakakabahala ang balita ng UNICEF. Sa ngayon, parang isang milyong bata ang 'at risk and unprotected' dahil wala sila ni isang bakuna (The UNICEF report us extremely worrisome. For now, it seems we have one million children who are at risk and unprotected because they do not have even a single vaccine),"" Binay pointed out.
""And with the resurgence of many other diseases plus the new Covid variants, the  government really has to step-up efforts in improving our immunization status. The DOH may also need to revamp its 'patak' strategies, and place a stable machinery to ensure the vaccination of one million children in two years max,"" she said.
The senator noted that until now, there are so many underserved communities whose critical link in the surveillance chain are the barangays.
""In order to help the DOH, the LGUs must likewise scale up its response via information campaign to help the public's vaccine confidence and deal with the level of community resistance against having their children vaccinated,"" she stressed out.
Nevertheless, she said, both the national and local governments must continue its routine immunization programs to address barriers and avert child survival crisis.
""We understand that the pandemic sidetracked the routine yet essential health services, thereby, leaving many children at risk,""
""Pero hindi natin pwedeng idahilan ang pandemic fatigue dahil meron tayong malaking accountability sa mga bata (But we shouldn't use pandemic fatigue as an excuse because we have a huge accountability over the children),"" she said.
She said landing fifth in the world, and second in East Asia in the survey definitely reflects the cost of inaction on zero-dose children.
""The government's commitment is to achieve vaccine equity. But the lack of access to essential vaccines and health services further exposes our children to multiple diseases that may lead to deaths,"" she pointed out.
""We need an 'exit plan'. We need a strong and renewed commitment—a political will, with intensified efforts from the national and local governments to fill the immunity gap by establishing sustainable service delivery mechanisms through primary health care platforms,"" Binay reiterated.
Furthermore, the senator also noted that the pandemic has diverted the government's focus and resources from routine health services leaving millions more of children at risk of vaccine-preventable diseases.
UNICEF maintained that health inequities brought by Covid-19, the number of zero-dose children is bound to increase further, leading to a rise in the number of child deaths and disease outbreaks.
""We do not want the number of zero-dose children to further balloon. On our part in the Senate, we are committed in investing in public health. We cannot allow our children to be victims of an immunization standstill,"" she said.
""We made sure that the DOH has the means to address and respond to such cases and problems, and dispense the necessary interventions specially in this vulnerable cohort,"" she stressed.

354,Most of PH may receive ‘below-normal’ rainfall by October — PAGASA,Ellalyn De Vera-Ruiz,"Apr 27, 2023 ","There is a “high probability” that most parts of the country may experience “below-normal” rainfall in October this year, based on the latest rainfall forecast of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).
In the rainfall forecast made public during the climate outlook forum on Wednesday, April 27, PAGASA said that the rainfall will be “generally below-normal in most parts of Luzon and Visayas, while [it will be] near-normal in Mindanao and the rest of the country.”

The El Niño or warm phase is expected to develop by the May–June–July season, but PAGASA said that its effects might not be felt until the end of the year.
Unusually warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific characterize this climate phenomenon.
According to PAGASA, El Niño raises the likelihood of below-average rainfall conditions, which might have adverse impact, including drought and dry spells in several parts of the country.

Based on PAGASA’s rainfall forecast from May to June, generally near-normal rainfall may prevail, with higher probability for near-to-above normal rainfall throughout the country.
By July, generally near-normal rainfall may persist in most parts of the country, with patches of above-normal rainfall in Luzon and below-normal rainfall in Davao City, Davao del Sur, and Cotabato.
By August, PAGASA said generally near-to-above normal rainfall may prevail over most parts of the country except for some areas in the Bicol Region, Visayas, and Mindanao that may experience below normal rainfall.
By September, generally near-normal rainfall may affect most parts of the country except for Camarines Sur that may receive below-normal rainfall.

355,Concepcion urges Congress to allow agri lands as loan collateral,Raymund Antonio,"Apr 27, 2023 ","Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion on Thursday, April 27, is prodding Congress to review the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) to allow farmers to use agrarian lands as collateral to access loans from banks.
He observed that under the agrarian reform, agricultural lands rewarded to farmers cannot be used as collateral for bank loans, which meant small farmers are unable to grow their production scale.
He pointed out that scaling up is the only way for farmers to compete with big agribusinesses and imported agriculture products, similar to farmers from Cambodia and Myanmar who run large tracks of lands.
“So, they can use the land to till the soil with whatever they grow –corn, rice, etc. pero (but) they cannot borrow, so nahihirapan ang mga maliliit nating farmers na umutang sa bangko (so our small farmers have a hard time borrowing from banks),” Concepcion, the president and CEO of RFM Corporation, said during the Laging Handa public briefing.
“But hopefully, maybe Congress can review the agrarian reform, which was done many, many years back ‘no and see how it can be modified so that this land that were given to our farmers – some of them are now formed cooperatives – can be collateralized ‘no for the purpose of working capital to be used only in the business of farming ‘no, nothing else,” he added.
Go Negosyo's Kapatid Angat Lahat (Kalap) program aims to bridge small farmers to markets through the help of big agribusinesses, Concepcion stressed the need to “take a look at the agrarian reform and see whether there are some things that we can tweak and correct.”
He shared that in a recent meeting, senior officials of the country’s 15 major banks admitted their apprehension on lending money to farmers.
Concepcion noted that banks said, “We’d rather pay the penalty than lend the farmers.” They were referring to the requirement that banks allocate a certain percentage of their loan portfolio to agrarian and agricultural (agra-agri) loans.
With big agribusinesses partnering with small farmers under the Kalap program, the Go Negosyo founder hopes banks would be more willing to take the risks of lending money to farmers.

356,Filipino evacuees fleeing Sudan fear for safety,Joseph Pedrajas,"Apr 27, 2023 ","Fear gripped a group of Filipinos as they travelled from the Sudanese capital to the north, where the Egyptian border is reached after a 15-hour ride.
A Filipino national evacuated from the deadly clashes in Sudan on Thursday recalled her journey as she joined other Filipino evacuees in getting into the Sudanese border with Egypt, where they would seek refuge.
Noemi Sanchez arrived at the exit point of Sudan early Thursday morning (Sudan time) through the assistance of the Philippine Embassy in Cairo that rented buses—although at a whopping rental price—for Filipino evacuees wanting to flee Khartoum.
She said members of warring factions, who are members of either military or the paramilitary, were already on the streets flagging evacuation vehicles, with some reportedly ransacking the valuables of fleeing individuals.
""Grabe po nakakatakot po yung daan kasi marami pong sundalo na nanghaharang (It's really terrifying because there were a lot of military personnel who were flagging down the evacuees),"" Sanchez said in an interview with Teleradyo.
""Yung iba daw pong sundalo nangunguha ng mga cellphone, mga pera. Pero nakakatakot talaga sir kasi umaakyat sila sa mga bus, talagang chine-check po talaga nila at saka... mga gutom na po sila (Some of them would forcibly take cell phones and money. It's really scary because they would get into the buses and check everything. They're also hungry),"" she added.
Sanchez was among the Filipinos based in Sudan who were evacuated by the Philippine Embassy in Cairo, which holds jurisdiction over Sudan, before being taken to the Egyptian city of Aswan.
In Aswan, Filipino evacuees would then fly to the Egyptian capital, Cairo, where they will either seek temporary refuge or be assisted for repatriation to the Philippines.
On Thursday morning, Philippine Ambassador to Egypt Ezzedin Tago welcomed the first batch of Filipinos who crossed the border to Egypt.
A total of 51 Filipinos safely arrived in Egypt after the embassy deployed buses to take them out of Sudan while there was a 72-hour ceasefire between the warring factions.
At the entry point of Egypt, Tago assisted the Filipino evacuees by coordinating with the Egyptian Foreign Affairs Ministry to process the visas of those who do not have one. Evacuees were allowed to get visa on arrival.
Meanwhile, at the exit point of Sudan, Philippine Vice Consul for Egypt Bojer Capati waited for Filipino evacuees in need of help, especially those who could not pay for their processing fee, according to Tago.
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) vowed to do ""whatever it takes"" to take Filipinos out of Sudan despite hurdles, including the scarcity in evacuation buses and the shooting up of rental prices.
Fighting erupted in Khartoum on April 15 due to power struggle between Sudan's military ruler, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and paramilitary leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo.

Senator Grace Poe on Thursday, April 27 slammed the Land Transportation Office (LTO) over its plan to allow motorists to rely on Do-It-Yourself (DIY) as a means to address the current shortage on vehicle plates.
""From license cards to motorcycle plates and car plates, the LTO has earned a notorious reputation of delivering short of what is expected,"" Poe said in a statement.
""Thorough planning and estimation might help the LTO be up to date with its requirements.  It can't always tell our people to rely on DIY and band-aid measures, which pose security risks and are prone to abuse,"" she pointed out.
Poe, head of the Senate Committee on Public Services, said the LTO ought to provide motorists transparent information regarding the vehicle plate backlogs.
""We ask the LTO to give the public a complete report on its backlog on vehicles plates and license cards to give a complete picture of the issues it is facing,"" she said.
""With this, we also expect to know its timeline for clearing its deficiencies and how it will do it,"" added the senator.
""Binabayaran ng motorista ang plaka at lisensya. Hindi katanggap-tanggap na sa huli, ang solusyon ay papel na kanya-kanyang imprenta (Motorists are paying for their vehicle plates and licenses.

Senator Ronald ""Bato"" Dela Rosa said on Thursday, April 27, that he is keen on recommending amendments to the country's Firearms Law or Republic Act No. 10591, following the Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs' hearing on the killing of Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo.
Dela Rosa said this is on top of other possible legislative measures that the panel, which he chairs, is also eyeing as policy reforms based on the committee's initial hearing on the case.
The senator also cited the necessity for a strong law that would effectively prevent the organization of private armies, and the imposition of the death penalty against erring security personnel who commit heinous crimes and taking undue advantage of their training, knowledge, and skills.
At the same time, the lawmaker also reiterated the need to enforce strict regulation on the selling and using of military and police uniforms, monitoring of dishonorably discharged military personnel, and inventory of loose firearms.
The former Philippine National Police (PNP) chief also cited the need to update the PNP's Standard of Procedures in addressing citizens' complaints.
""As always, we emphasize that this is in aid of legislation. Paano ba makakatulong ang Senado (How can the Senate help)?"" Dela Rosa pointed out.
""Anong mga polisiya ang kailangang gawin at anong batas ang kailangan nating amyendahan (What are the policies we need to do and what laws need to be amended)?"" he said.
Dela Rosa, however, has yet to wrap up the Senate's investigation saying he still plans to conduct one more hearing to cover the past and present law and order situation in Negros Oriental.
The panel's first three hearings unearthed more killing incidents, land grabbing cases, e-sabong and illegal gambling, intimidation and threat to “uncooperative” authorities, the existence of private armies with unlicensed firearms, and involvement of police personnel in criminal activities and cover-ups.
He said his committee is also considering legislative measures aimed at amending the
Omnibus Election Code, particularly section 69 on nuisance candidates.
The senator also said he is eyeing an amendment to the Local Government Code to ensure that the authority to appoint police provincial directors must be with the PNP and not with the local government officials.

359,LTO re-orients personnel on anti-red tape,Aaron Recuenco,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The Land Transportation Office-National Capital Region West (LTO-NCR West) has launched a re-orientation program for all its employees as part of the measures to strengthen anti-red tape measures.
LTO-NCR West Director Roque ""Rox"" I. Verzosa III said the program was aimed at facilitating transactions and to minimize, if not eliminate, corruption in the agency and was conducted by personnel from the Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA).
“This is in line with the commitment of the LTO, under Assistant Secretary JayArt Tugade, to improving public service in line with the national government’s goal of easing all the transactions with the government,” said Verzosa.
LTO-NCR West Operations Chief Hanzley H. Lim stated that the re-orientation seminar covered a wide range of topics, including the legal basis of the Anti-Red Tape Act (Republic Act 11032), the creation of the Citizen's Charter, Whole-of-Government reengineering, the constitution of the Committee on Anti-Red Tape (CART), Client Satisfaction Measurement reporting, and the implementation of a Zero Backlog Policy
Among the topics discussed were Republic Act 11032 (promotion of ease of doing business) which was presented by lawyer May Angeli M. Estolas; Citizen’s Charter by Marco Angelo V. Montenegro; Whole-of-Government Reengineering Manual by Cady Lene A. Perez; and Zero Backlog Policy by  Sarah Jane C. Ramos.
LTO-NCR West Administration chief Pio Erta said the speakers hold key positions in the agency.
Shortly after the seminar, LTO Caloocan District Office Chief Ferdinand M. Magno, Navotas Extension Office Chief Alex L. Soneja, and Paranaque District Office Chief Florante S. Martin stepped up their efforts to combat corruption by implementing stricter anti-fixing measures in their offices.
Magno's office, in particular, established four key strategies following ARTA's seminar and their own determination to combat corruption, namely: Random Monitoring, Stakeholder Visitation, Internal Background Checking, and Increased Public Awareness.
“There is a need to increase public awareness about LTO processes, which is why we established a Public Assistance Desk and posted the Citizen's Charter, both of which were covered during the ARTA seminar,” said Magno. 
Verzosa expressed support for the initiatives taken by the Caloocan District Office and has shared Magno's report with other district offices to explore how they can be implemented locally.

360,Villanueva: Include agri insurance woes in gov’t’s El Nino plan,Mario Casayuran,"Apr 27, 2023 ","Agricultural insurance problems of farmers should be included in the government’s plan to mitigate the impacts of El Nino, Senate Majority Leader Joel Villanueva on Thursday, April 27, said.
He said that 22.2 percent or 10.5 million employed Filipinos depend on agriculture as a source of income based on a Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) in its Labor Force Survey last January 2023.
Villanueva, thus, filed Senate Resolution 549 which seeks to look into the state of the government’s agricultural insurance program, considering the impact of unfortunate natural occurrences on agriculture.
Ultimately, Villanueva seeks to put in place sufficient measures to protect Filipino farmers and fisherfolk.
“Almost one-fourth of our labor force are in the agriculture sector and if we don’t take the necessary measures to protect it, we will see a severe decline in employment which will in turn lead to low agricultural production, endangering the livelihood of millions of Filipinos in the sector and also our country's food security,” he said.
Villanueva said that the low availment of agricultural insurance for farmers is alarming given that the country needs to be prepared for the impacts of natural extreme events, disasters and climate change.
“Our agriculture insurance program needs to be future-ready and easily accessible for the benefit of our farmers and fisherfolk,” he added.
The Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation (PCIC) provides insurance under seven agricultural insurance lines: rice crop, corn crop, high-value crops, livestock, fisheries & aquaculture, non-crop agricultural assets and credit and life-term insurance.
In 2020, the PCIC was able to insure a total of 3,090,251 farmers and fisherfolk. The amount of protection assured was P 94.591 billion and the premium generated was P5.086 billion,” the resolution said.
The Majority Leader noted that the PCIC should address the issues of farmers on filing indemnity claims such as the lack of knowledge and the long process of claims payments, documentary requirements, and additional costs which led to its low availment.
According to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), while La Niña has officially ended, the country needs to brace and prepare for El Niño which is expected to be declared by May.
The resolution states that “among the major factors for the low productivity and erratic trends in agriculture are climate change, regular weather disturbances and disasters.”
The Department of Agriculture (DA) said that weather disturbances left P746 million in agricultural damages in January 2023 alone. The PSA also estimated that from 2010 to 2019, damages to agriculture totaled P 290 billion.
“The government must ensure the accessibility, availability and sufficiency of safety nets to protect the livelihood of Filipinos employed in agriculture and the food security of the entire country,” the resolution stated.

361,"Cong Villar seeks final House nod for bill banning 'no permit, no exam' rule",Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 27, 2023 ","House Deputy Speaker and Las Pinas City lone district Rep. Camille Villar is prodding her congressman-colleagues to pass on third and final reading the bill banning the restrictive “no permit, no exam” policy in educational institutions.
This, after the lady solon cited recent social media posts wherein some students were seen lining up shortly after midnight to get permit for their exams.
“Students should not be barred from taking exams due to their inability to pay tuition and other school fees at the time of their examinations. Hindi lang sa kolehiyo nangyayari ito ngayon kundi pati sa elementary at high school (This happens not only in college but also in elementary and high school),” lamented Villar.
Villar, one of the principal authors of House Bill (HB) No.7584 or ""An Act allowing elementary and secondary learners with unpaid tuition and other school fees to take the periodic and final examinations on good cause and justifiable grounds"", reiterated that the measure will provide relief to families facing economic difficulties.
Villar made the call to approve the measure ahead of the May 8 resumption of sessions in Congress.
“Poverty should not be an issue to get quality education,"" said the House leader.
Under the measure, private basic educational institutions shall adopt appropriate policies to accommodate and allow learners, who, due to emergencies, force majeure, and good cause or other justifiable reasons, have unsettled financial obligations, to take the scheduled periodic exams.
Parents or guardians, however, must execute a promissory note for the settlement of the outstanding financial obligation. Any deferment of payment of unpaid balance shall not go beyond the school year, except when allowed by the school.
Sanctions await schools found guilty of violating provisions of the measure.
Villar said the bill was approved on second reading by the House before lawmakers went on summer break last March 15.
Its counterpart measure in the Senate, Senate Bill No.(SB) No.1359, has been approved on third and final reading.

362,Delays in stenographic notes affect court proceedings; SC vows to resolve thru automation,Rey G. Panaligan,"Apr 27, 2023 ","Chief Justice Alexander G. Gesmundo said the shortage of court stenographers and the difficulty to recruit new applicants will soon be resolved as the judiciary embarks on full court automation in its five-year Strategic Plan for Judicial Innovations (SPJI).
The delays in the submission of stenographic notes that affect court proceedings have impacts “on our people’s faith in the judiciary and their confidence in its ability to effectively and efficiently dispense the justice they seek in it,” Gesmundo said.
“Truly, the work of court stenographers serves as one of the unseen foundations of the rule of law in our country -- foundations that are often unnoticed, but are no less important,” he said in his speech during the convention of the Court Stenographers Association of the Philippines (COSTRAPHIL) in Dipolog City last Wednesday, April 26.
To speed up the submission of stenographic notes during court proceedings, Gesmundo said the SPJI allows the use of artificial intelligence (AI) not just for court operations but also for stenographic work “to facilitate the speedy disposition of case.”
“We can harness AI-enabled voice-to-text transcription services to make stenographic work more efficient and more effective. As the SPJI notes, in other jurisdictions, AI-powered applications are already being used to support court stenographers,” he said.
“We are looking to study and harness the same tools here at home. After these tools generate automated transcripts, stenographers can then make corrections and enhancements; these will be fed back into the software’s system through adaptive algorithms, allowing it to constantly improve,” he also said.
The use of AI-enabled voice-to-text transcription will be pilot tested in several courts. “If it is successful, we will roll out AI-powered transcription technology in additional courts, and, hopefully, across all our courts,” said Gesmundo who was with Justice Jose Midas P. Marquez during the convention.
He immediately allayed the fears of court stenographers who may think that full automation would make their jobs irrelevant in the courts.
“And we are aware that there are apprehensions from those who encounter the words reorganization, digitization, and automation, and hear downsizing and layoffs,” he said.
“Again, let me be clear: when we talk of pushing the judiciary forward through innovation, we mean exactly that -- to propel the judiciary, in its entirety, forward. That means bringing everyone, including our court stenographers, in tow. Sa maikling salita: sa SPJI, sisiguruhin nating walang mapag-iiwanan (In short, with SPJI we will make sure that none will be left behind), he stressed.
Gesmundo assured that “while our efforts seem outward-looking, we have made it a point to uphold and promote the interest of all the women and men who comprise the judiciary, and who have dedicated their lives to service—like our court stenographers—for you deserve no less.”
He also said in his speech:
“With all this talk of technology, it could be all too easy to miss that these reforms are as much for us as they are for the public we serve. We are not pursuing innovation for innovation’s sake: through digitization and automation, we will be able to unleash our potential and upgrade our skills for more meaningful work.
“As we reorganize our systems and transform our processes, we are freed from the shackles of bureaucracy that limit our productivity, and we are empowered to lead happier and healthier lives.
“My hope is that these are the same ideas that we center on when we talk about the SPJI and our efforts to revitalize the judiciary. Alongside this, I call on our court stenographers to fully embrace technology in the performance of your duties, especially as we pursue reform through innovation.
“Harness it to work more efficiently and expeditiously. Invest in the skills and resources needed to enable the shift that we envision. Be active agents of reform, bearing in mind that these innovations are meant not to supplant us, but to support us.
“In performing your tasks efficiently and effectively, you help win back our people’s faith in our legal system. In exemplifying rigor and excellence in doing your duties, you help safeguard the rule of law.”

363,SIM registration fee allowed—DICT,Betheena Unite,"Apr 27, 2023 ","Retail outlets charging customers for registering their SIM cards on their behalf are not violating any law, a Cabinet member said.
Department of Information and Communications Technology Secretary Ivan John Uy said it is merely a ""private transaction"" between the seller and SIM card user, who opted to get help from an individual in registering the SIM.
""Well, actually it’s a private transaction between the SIM card holder and the, and the SIM seller ‘no, retailer ba ito? Mga retailer, nasa palengke, oo (Retailers in the markets, yes). So, it’s a private transaction between them,"" Uy said in a Palace press briefing.
He said the SIM card holder is merely ""asking for assistance from an individual"" and it is only proper to pay for their service, especially if the sellers used their own mobile data for registration.
He likened the transaction to pay phones in stores, where the caller pays for P5 per call.
""Hindi naman siguro lumalabag sa batas na mag-charge sila ng kaunting fee dahil may gastos rin naman sila (I don't think they are violating any law by charging a small fee because they also spent their own resources there),"" Uy said.
""And I think 20 pesos is very, very reasonable. And for many na medyo digitally challenged, I think nakakatulong naman iyon (who are digitally challenged, I think this can help them),"" Uy added.
The DICT chief said this after President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. approved the proposal to extend the SIM registration period after the April 26 deadline.
According to Uy, Marcos was compelled to extend the deadline due to the remaining 20 million unregistered SIM cards and low turnout in island provinces.

364,Bus rental for Sudan evacuation shoots up to $30K each --- DFA,Joseph Pedrajas,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The rental price of evacuation buses in Sudan has gone up for as much as P1.5 million or 30,000 US dollars each just to get out from the deadly conflict Filipinos who want to seek refuge in nearby Egypt.
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Undersecretary Eduardo Jose de Vega said Thursday that the price to rent a bus in Sudan is now getting ""expensive"" as its capital city, Khartoum, is becoming a ""war zone"" for military and paramilitary forces in struggle for power.
Initially, rental buses only cost 450,000 pesos or 8,000 US dollars, according to Department of Migrant Workers (DMA) Secretary Toots Ople.
""'Di tayo mangunguripot dyan (We won't be tight-fisted), [we will do everything] whatever it takes para makakuha ng bus,"" de Vega said in an interview with Teleradyo.
On Wednesday night, the Philippine government raised an Alert Level 3 status (voluntary repatriation and evacuation) for Filipinos in Sudan.
The government has been struggling to evacuate Filipinos from Sudan not only because of increasing rental prices but also due to scarcity of available buses.
Nevertheless, more than 400 of the 700 registered Filipinos in Sudan were either already taken out there or are already on their way to the border in Egypt.
The big bulk of the evacuees would be arriving onboard the seven buses that were newly contracted by the Philippine Embassy in Egypt. Once in Egypt, they will travel by land to the Egyptian city of Aswan before flying to the capital, Cairo, and to the Philippines.
Meanwhile, Philippine Ambassador to Egypt Ezzedin Tago, who holds jurisdiction over Filipinos in Sudan, assisted the evacuees who arrived in Egypt to ensure their entry.
According to him, the embassy asked the Egyptian authorities to allow Filipinos entry into their country despite not having the necessary visa.
""As an exemption, we asked the authorities here that had been gracious to allow visa on arrival dahil walang paraan na kumuha ng visa sa Khartoum (because there was no way for Filipinos to process their visa in Khartoum),"" Tago said in an interview with Unang Balita.
Filipino evacuees will be given assistance with or without the necessary visa; while those who do not have their passport or legal documents will have to wait a little longer, probably until Friday, to enter Egypt, according to the ambassador.
The embassy also sent Vice Consul Bojer Capati to Sudan to assist Filipinos at the border, especially those who could not afford the processing fee for their departure.
The Philippine government is hopeful that there would be another ceasefire, which was due to end on Thursday evening, as there was a reported talk of such in South Sudan.

365,Legarda urges women leaders to take the lead in addressing climate change,Mario Casayuran,"Apr 27, 2023 ","Senate President Pro Tempore Loren Legarda has highlighted the vital role of gender equality in addressing environmental issues and urged the women leaders to put the goal for a sustainable future through climate change adaptation and disaster risk management on top of their priority
Legarda stressed this when she graced the launching of Women International Network for Disaster Risk Reduction (WIN DRR) held Wednesday at the SM Mall of Asia in Pasay City.
""Climate change affects all of us, but how men and women are affected is different. It is not gender-neutral. Women are found to be more affected by climate impacts than men because of cultural and societal roles and prevailing gender inequalities,"" she said.
Legarda has emphasized that climate change is more than just an environmental issue but poses significant risks to socio-economic and political stability, particularly in fragile and conflict-ridden areas.

Women in these areas become more vulnerable to gender-based violence, such as conflict-related sexual violence, human trafficking, and child marriage, she pointed out.
Legarda emphasized that climate change and disasters further exacerbate the health risks for women due to limited access to adequate healthcare and services, a serious concern that Legarda wants to address with a sense of urgency.
She said she believes that policies related to climate change must prioritize integrating gender considerations throughout the planning, financing, and implementation stages.
As a longtime advocate for women's empowerment and the environment, Legarda authored Republic Act 9729, or the Climate Change Act, which includes a provision that at least one of the commissioners of the Climate Change Commission (CCC) must be female.
This provision aims to integrate the gender lens and gender-responsive approaches into the policies and programs on climate change.
She also initiated several nationwide information and education campaigns to promote disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation in line with her advocacy.
These included organizing regional workshops for local government units and founding the Luntiang Pilipinas greening program.
Several actions have already been taken to address the growing concern about climate change.
But this year, being ranked as the world's most at-risk country among 193 countries worldwide in the World Risk Index 2022, Legarda reminded the women leaders attending the WIN DRR launch that there is still much more to be done.
""We need crisis and disaster risk women leaders to save more lives. We women leaders from grassroots groups to global organizations can step up to drive meaningful action,"" she said.
""It is time to be bold, take responsibility, and create a more climate resilient world, which requires taking decisive action and making significant changes to the way we live and interact with the environment. Together, we can strive towards a vision of a more resilient and sustainable future,’’ she added.

366,"CHR to gov’t, rebels: ‘Handle conflicts without bloodshed, human rights abuses’",Czarina Nicole Ong Ki,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) said the reintegration of 37,413 former rebels and violent extremists to civil society since 2016 has proven that the government can handle conflicts without bloodshed and human rights abuses.
In a statement, the CHR urged an end to hostilities as it invited anti-government forces to cease their attacks and focus instead on peace efforts.
Instead of addressing conflict with conflict, the CHR said the government should focus on the root causes of conflict such as poverty, unequal treatment, and marginalization.
""In the same vein, we continue to urge the government to amplify holistic and peaceful efforts with human rights at its core in addressing and preventing grievances and issues that fuel conflict,"" it stressed.
The CHR lauded the reintegration of the former rebels and violent extremists.
It noted the report of the Task Force Balik Loob (TFBL) that 10,637 former rebels were granted livelihood and reintegration benefits, as well as firearms remuneration, through the Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-CLIP).
""The CHR commends these developments and supports the government’s efforts to handle armed conflict through peaceful means.”
It said that Department of National Defense (DND) Undersecretary Angelito M. de Leon, chairperson of the TFBL, reported that they have acquired surrendered weapons worth approximately P151 million and provided P164.5 million worth of reintegration program benefits to former rebels and violent extremists.
It also said that TFBL reported that an additional P322.8 million worth of livelihood assistance was provided by TFBL’s partner agencies.
It pointed out that E-CLIP and Payapa at Masaganang Pamayanan (PAMANA), another government initiative to take care of former rebels, is a ""sustainable"" effort since it provides livelihood, housing, education, and improved access of communities to basic necessities and government services.
""TFBL -- itself composed of multi-sectoral lead agencies covering defense, governance, housing, and peacebuilding -- shows that multi-sectoral collaborations serve crucial roles in preventing further violence, conflict, and division,"" the CHR noted.

367,DepEd commits to participate in hearings on proposed ‘K + 10 + 2’ bill,Merlina Hernando-Malipot,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The Department of Education (DepEd) on Thursday, April 27, expressed commitment to participate in the hearings on the proposed bill to replace the existing K to 12 basic education program.
On April 26, House Senior Deputy Speaker and former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo proposed the conversion of the K to 12 education program into the K + 10 + 2 system through House Bill (HB) No.7893.
In the bill’s explanatory note, the Pampanga representative noted that the proposed bill seeks to replace the existing K to 12 education program in the country which covers Kindergarten and 12 years of education with a “K + 10 + 2 program covering compulsory Kindergarten and 10 years of basic education with, for those seeking to proceed to professional degree studies such as accounting, engineering, law, medicine, an additional two years of post-secondary, pre-university education.”

https://mb.com.ph/2023/4/26/arroyo-wants-to-replace-k-to-12-with-k-10-2-find-out-more
Currently, the K to 12 program is composed of mandatory Kindergarten, Elementary (Grades 1 to 6); Junior High School (Grades 7 to 10); and Senior High School (Grades 11 and 12).
Asked to comment on the “K+ 10 +2” proposal, DepEd Spokesperson Michael Poa said that “DepEd commits to participate in the congressional hearings on the proposed bill.”
K to 12 review
Meanwhile, Poa said that the review of the K to 12 curriculum --- particularly the SHS program --- is still ongoing.
The K to 10 curriculum guide, Poa said, has already “been published for comments.”
In September 2022, DepEd said that it has completed the review of the K to 12 curriculum for Kinder to Grade 10.
DepEd also said that the review of the curriculum for the additional two years in the country’s basic education cycle or the SHS Program started last November.
Introduced under the administration of the late former president Benigno S. Aquino III, the K to 12 program aims to “provide sufficient time for mastery of concepts and skills, develop lifelong learners, and prepare graduates for tertiary education, middle-level skills development, employment, and entrepreneurship.”
During the presentation of DepEd’s Basic Education Report (BER) 2023 in January, Vice President Sara Duterte said that promise of the K to 12 curriculum to produce employable graduates “remains a promise.”
In October 2022, in an interview on the sidelines of the 48th Philippine Business Conference and Expo, Duterte said that DepEd is still “continuing our meetings and discussion on how to make our Grade 12 graduates ready for employment.”

368,Chinese ship carrying nickel ore runs aground off Eastern Samar waters,Aaron Recuenco,"Apr 27, 2023 ","A Chinese bulk carrier carrying nickel ore from the Visayas ran aground off the waters of Guiuan, Eastern Samar, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) disclosed on Thursday, April 27.
The report stated that the Chinese-flagged bulk carrier, MV ZHE HAI 168 ran aground at the vicinity waters approximately 2.7 nautical miles off the shoreline of Barangay Sulangan, Guiuan, Eastern Samar on April 18.
“Based on the investigation, the bulk carrier, with 20 Chinese crew on board, was transporting nickel ore from Homonhon Island, Eastern Samar, to Caofeidian (China) when the accident occurred,” the report read.
As soon as the report was received, PCG personnel were sent to the area to assist the crew and conduct ocular inspection on the vessel with local officials of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).
“A surface assessment for possible traces of oil spill yielded a negative result,” the PCG report read.
The Chinese crew confirmed no leakage or damage inside the vessel, the report added.
The PCG is now preparing for the arrival of a salvage team from Singapore to conduct operations.  They will temporarily transfer the cargo to a barge and pull out the ship.
“The Coast Guard Sub-Station Guiuan will supervise the salvage operations and ensure no spillage will occur by installing oil spill booms. After the successful pull-out of the bulk carrier, the PCG will conduct another hull assessment,” the report stated.
“Meanwhile, DENR-Environment Management Bureau divers will also evaluate the condition of corals at the marine protected area near the vicinity waters for damage claims,” it added.

369,"DHSUD to use solar, other renewable energy sources in some housing projects",Aaron Recuenco,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (DHSUD) is pushing for the incorporation of solar and renewable energy sources in an as many of its housing projects in the country.
DHSUD Secretary Jose Rizalino Acuzar said the move is the department’s own contribution to hazards of climate change by supporting smart and green community concepts that would reduce the country’s use of coal-powered energy source.
“Pambansang Pabahay (national housing) is not just about quantity and quality of housing, it also adopts new and green technologies to promote sustainability. More than just reaching our targets, we, at DHSUD, aim to improve the quality of living so we see to it that the communities we develop are sustainable. This is why we keep our doors open for collaboration and innovations,” said Acuzar.
""Hopefully, these innovations presented to us will come into fruition...to set higher standards in our housing sector,"" he added.
Pilot project 
Acuzar cited d as an example, the proposal of First Dynabloc Construction and Development Corporation, in collaboration with the San Rafael, Bulacan for the local government unit's (LGU)  shelter project in Barangay Caingin.
The San Rafael Housing Project, composed of 3,920 residential units on a seven-hectare development site, is touted as the first fully sustainable integrated housing project in the Philippines, incorporating latest technologies for renewable energy into its design.
The proposed plans feature solar and wind energy sources, water generating system, an integrated waste management system and transport innovations.
Based on architectural and site development plans, a PowerNEST system shall be installed on rooftops of residential buildings.  The system generates renewable energy for beneficiaries using both solar and wind power and is said to be more efficient without producing noise, vibrations or any other disturbance.
In addition, the design shall also introduce a patented atmospheric water generation system known as the “GEN-L” which can efficiently produce pure drinking water from the humidity in the surrounding air. It has a built-in multi-barrier air filtration system which removes micro-particles and organic traces and adds essential minerals.
GEN-L only requires electricity to function and is already being used in military bases, villages, hospitals and off-grid settlements around the globe.
Air ventilation, garbage chutes on each residential floor and waste management facilities which are carbon emission conscious shall also be provided, along with areas for public transportation utilizing electronic shuttles.
The San Rafael Housing Project was among the six sites simultaneously launched during the “mega groundbreaking” in Bulacan province last April 19.
No added cost 
Acuzar assured that the use of renewable energy sources in the housing program of the government will have no effect on the cost of the housing units.
“The developer will own and maintain the technologies which are projected to reduce the operating costs, making living more affordable and sustainable,” said Acuzar. 
He said such technology boosts the Department’s commitment to ensure development of sustainable communities, as mandated by Republic Act 11201.
“As we pursue our mandate and address the housing need, integrating sustainability in our designs is paramount. Let us work together as we take on the huge responsibility to ensure that our actions today will have no negative impact on the environment so future generations could enjoy the same,” said Acuzar.

RA 11930, which lapsed into law on July 30, 2022, was authored by Sen. Risa Hontiveros.  The law grants additional tools for law enforcement and increases responsibilities of social media platforms, electronic service providers, as well as internet and financial intermediaries.
IACAT said that during last Monday’s meeting, the draft of the 2023  Revised Guidelines on Departure Formalities for International-Bound Filipino Passengers was also presented.
But it said the approval of the draft revised guidelines was “deferred to give the member agencies more time to submit their comments on the latest draft and to allow the conduct of a public consultation thereafter.”
It said that the council decided to revise the guidelines after receiving reports that immigration officers have been found abusing the departure formalities that has led to a number of Filipinos missing or rebooking their flights.
Also during the meeting, DOJ Assistant Secretaries Jose Dominic F. Clavano IV and Francis John L. Tejano were presented as its newest members.
Clavano has been designated to oversee communications and policy concerns, while Tejano will oversee operations and administrative concerns.
Earlier, members of IACAT had vowed to have a synchronized and coordinated advocacy against human trafficking in the next five years as they launched the council’s 4th National Strategic Action Plan Against Trafficking in Persons for 2023 to 2027.
Aside from the secretary of justice, the other members of IACAT are the secretary of the Department of Social Welfare & Development, as co-chairperson, secretary of Department of Education, secretary of Department of Foreign Affairs, secretary of the Department of Labor & Employment, secretary of the Department of the Interior and Local Government,

374,"'Huge dividends' from Marcos-Biden meeting await PH, says Romualdez",Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The upcoming meeting between President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. and United States (US) President Joe Biden will pay huge dividends for the Philippines, particularly in the realm of security and the economy.
Thus, said House Speaker Martin Romualdez, who for the past two weeks has been in the US meeting with the top officials there, mostly lawmakers.
“The meeting between President Marcos and US President Biden will further reinforce the robust long-term bilateral relations between the Philippines and the United States and I am confident it would redound to huge dividends for our country in terms of security and increased economic cooperation, among others,” Romualdez said in a statement Thursday, April 27.
An official US State Department statement said that during the visit, “President Biden will reaffirm the United States’ ironclad commitment to the defense of the Philippines, and the leaders will discuss efforts to strengthen the longstanding U.S.-Philippines alliance.”
For his part, President Marcos said he would seek a review and assessment of the commitments under the 70-year Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) between the two countries stressing that the alliance must “evolve” to address the emerging geopolitical realities, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region.
“Security and stability are indispensable ingredients for continued economic growth and prosperity. An improved iron-clad alliance between the two countries would greatly contribute to the realization of President Marcos’ vision for sustained economic growth that would provide jobs and livelihood for the Filipinos,” said Romualdez, who represents the 1st district of Leyte.
As part of the defense pact between the two countries, the Philippines has been receiving substantial defense assistance from the US in terms of training and defense items and equipment.
From 2002 to 2021, the country received roughly US$1.8 billion for defense modernization, maritime security, counter-terrorism, anti-narcotics, anti-human trafficking, humanitarian assistance and disaster response, and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear preparedness.
In addition to security matters, Marcos and Biden are also expected to “review opportunities to deepen economic cooperation and promote inclusive prosperity, expand our nations’ special people-to-people ties, invest in the clean energy transition and the fight against climate change, and ensure respect for human rights"".
The House Speaker noted that Washington remains an important and strategic trading and investment partner of Manila.
In 2021, the US was the Philippines' 3rd largest trading partner, top export market, and 5th major import source, whereas the Philippines ranked 30th among the US' top trade partners.
The US was also the Philippines' 5th largest source of foreign investments in 2021, notably in the IT-BPM, electronics, real estate, construction, and transportation and storage sectors.
Romualdez and his delegation to the US also engaged their US counterparts to promote the Philippines as an ideal investment destination for US businesses, citing the robust economic outlook for the country.
""With our strong economy, we invited the US to increase and expand its investments,” he said.

375,BI rescues 4 Pinay victims of human trafficking,Jun Ramirez,"Apr 27, 2023 ","Four Filipino women heading to Lebanon to work as household service workers were rescued by Bureau of Immigration (BI) agents at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).
BI Commissioner Norman Tansingco said three of the victims were cleared for departure when they were intercepted while attempting to board an Air Asia flight to Kuala Lumpur on April 21.
Another female victim was intercepted on the same day as she attempted to depart via a Cebu Pacific flight bound for Bangkok.
The passengers initially claimed that they were tourists but later confessed that their final destination was Lebanon, where they had been recruited to work.
The victims revealed that they were recruited by someone named Helen whom they met on Facebook and who provided them with travel documents.
They said their recruiter instructed them to queue for clearance at a specific immigration booth.
The officer who cleared the victims has since been relieved of his duties and is undergoing investigation.
The victims were turned over to the Inter-Agency Against Trafficking (IACAT) for investigation and filing of cases against their recruiters.
Tansingco emphasized that sending people abroad without proper documents and to countries with existing deployment bans raises security threats for overseas Filipino workers (OFWs).

376,Feast of the Virgin of Montserrat on April 27,Christina Hermoso,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The Catholic Church commemorates on Thursday, April 27, the feast day of Our Lady of Montserrat, the popular Black Madonna of Spain.
Widely venerated in Catalonia, Spain, where devotion to the La Moreneta (Black Madonna) originated, as well as in Puerto Rico and Ecuador, Our Lady of Montserrat is well known for her miraculous intercessory powers.
Pilgrims and devotees from different parts of the world visit her major shrine at the foot of Montecristi Hill in Ecuador every year.
In Catalonia, Spain, where Our Lady has been widely venerated since the 12th century, the Shrine of Our Lady of Montserrat is a popular pilgrimage site. She is honored as the Patron Saint of Catalonia, an honor she shares with Saint George.
In the country, the Abbey of Our Lady of Montserrat Church in San Beda College, Manila was built in honor of the patroness of the Benedictine monks of Manila.
Devotion to her is also widespread in Jaro, Iloilo City where a parish church has been erected in her honor.
According to tradition, the image of the Black Madonna with the Child Jesus was carved by St. Luke the Evangelist around 50 A.D. and was brought to Spain.
An 18th century polychrome statue of the same image that was gifted by President Joao Goulart of Brazil on the Papal election of Pope Paul VI in 1963, is also displayed in Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome, Italy. Previously stored in the Vatican Museums, the image has been on display for Papal masses since the Pontificate of the late Pope Benedict XVI.
On September 11, 1881, the image was canonically crowned in accordance with Canon Law and was proclaimed as the patroness of Catalonia by Pope Leo XIII. Many pilgrims paid homage to her including Saints Vincent Ferrer, Ignatius of Loyola, Aloysius Gonzaga, Peter Claver, and Anthony Mary Claret.
The Abbey of Our Lady of Montserrat in Barcelona is the founding monastery of the Benedictines in the Philippines. The first Benedictine monks arrived in the country in 1895.

379,"Keep fishing bans in Oriental Mindoro, BFAR recommends",Jel Santos,"Apr 27, 2023 ","The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) has recommended keeping the fishing ban imposed in Oriental Mindoro areas affected by the oil spill caused by the sinking of Motor Tanker (MT) Princess Empress.
In BFAR's Oil Spill Bulletin No. 3 released Wednesday, April 27, the bureau cited results of oil and grease examination in water samples obtained from affected areas in Oriental Mindoro on April 10 showed significant increases in levels from prior analyses.
""Albeit [it is] still within the standard for oil and grease of < 3.0 mg/L of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) based on water classification and use,"" it stated.
Meanwhile, low levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were also discovered by the BFAR in all fish samples obtained on April 3 from Oriental Mindoro.
""PAH accumulation was observed in samples collected from the municipalities of Bongabong and San Teodoro; however, there is currently no sufficient data showing an increasing trend,"" the bureau noted.
""In light of these developments, the DA-BFAR recommends keeping fishing bans in oil spill-hit municipalities in Oriental Mindoro since the analyses are not yet conclusive evidence as far as food safety is concerned.""
Meanwhile, the BFAR has recommended alternative fishing grounds, in coordination with the Department of the Interior and Local Government, to assist municipal fisherfolk get back to their livelihoods.
""These are the municipal waters of Paluan, Abra de Ilog, San Jose, and Magsaysay in Occidental Mindoro; Boac and Gasan in Marinduque; and Concepcion in Romblon.""
The bureau said it will provide oil spill-affected fishers with fuel subsidies as additional assistance.
Fishing okay in Antique
According to the BFAR, all water samples collected from Caluya, Antique on March 28 passed the DENR threshold for oil and grease.
It was noted that fish samples collected from the province on April 11 showed no signs of oil tainting through organoleptic analyses.
However, evidence of oil tainting was found on shellfish samples, and seaweed samples previously subjected to laboratory investigation revealed traces of PAHs.
Fishing activities are allowed outside the reef zone of affected areas of Sitio Sabang, Barangay Tinogboc, Sitio Sigayan, Sitio Toong, Barangay Semirara, Sitio Liwagao, Barangay Sibolo and adjacent deeper waters, the BFAR said.
On the other hand, the bureau recommended prohibiting shellfish gathering and seaweed harvesting in affected areas since these organisms may have greater exposure to oil spill contaminants.
The MT Princess Empress's sinking off the coast of Naujan, Oriental Mindoro, on Feb. 28 caused the oil disaster. Some 800,000 gallons of industrial fuel were being transported by the tanker, per the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG).

380,No special treatment: Ex-cop Mayo under tight BJMP security- Abalos,Chito Chavez,"Apr 27, 2023 ","Under no circumstances dismissed Police Master Sgt. Rodolfo Mayo Jr. be accorded special treatment while detained at the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) jail facility, Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Benjamin “Benhur” Abalos Jr. assured in an exclusive interview on Thursday, April 27.
Abalos pronounced this to dispel public suspicion that Mayo, being involved in the P6.7 billion illegal drug haul in Oct. 2022 in Tondo, Manila, has the financial capacity to supposedly pay-off jail personnels to provide him with comfort while incarcerated.
Critics have raised issues against jail officials, specifically those manning high-profile convicted criminal offenders, who allegedly enjoy perks and privileges that were way above what are accorded to regular persons deprived of liberty (PDLs).
Abalos stated that Mayo was holed up in a prison cell only with his co-accused, Ney Altadero,  after initially having three other PDLs share the facility with them.
“Yes, pina secure maigi. Dalawa lang sila sa selda ng co-accused niya, si Altadero. Pinalagyan ko pa ng CCTV para sigurado (their security) (I had them totally secured. There were only two of them inside the jail facility, the other one being his co accused Altadero. I also had CCTV installed to ensure their security),’’ Abalos stated.
Abalos’ statement assured there is absolutely no special treatment accorded to them despite Mayo sharing a cell only with Altadero in the heavily-congested BJMP jail facility.
In an interview over GMA News, BJMP spokesperson Maj. Jayrex Bustinera explained that being high-value targets, Mayo and Altadero need to have tightened security to prevent any untoward incident that may befall against them.
“Ang high-value target ay may risk sa kanyang buhay o kaya siya ay ma injure kaya hindi natin hinahalo sa general population (A high value target has risk against his life or may get injured that is why we isolate him) We are preparing against worst scenario,” Bustinera stated.
Bustinera added that Mayo has displayed generally good behavior and has not gotten out of his cell since being brought to the Taguig City Jail Facility.
Mayo was arrested in Oct. 2022 after authorities seized 990 kilograms of suspected shabu in a series of anti-drug operations in Manila.
Mayo, who served as intelligence officer for the PNP Drug Enforcement Group, was dismissed from the police ranks on March 21, 2023.

381,Tulfo alarmed over rising cases of autism in PH,Mario Casayuran,"Apr 27, 2023 "," 
Senator Raffy Tulfo on Thursday, April 27, expressed alarm over the continued increase in the number of people diagnosed with autism in the country, which include even those without family history of autism.
 
Tulfo made the statement in time for the observance of the National Autism Awareness Month this April.
 
The senator is also pushing for swift congressional passage of his Senate Bill (SB) 752, or the “Autism Cooperation, Accountability, Research, Education and Support (CARES) Act of 2022”, which seeks to address and increase support for persons with autism. He filed the measure in July, 2022.
 
Data from the Department of Health (DOH) shows that the number of Filipinos with autism has ballooned from 500,000 in 2008 to one million in 2018. It has doubled in just 10 years.
 
Notably, several studies abroad have concluded that mothers who take paracetamol while pregnant have a higher chance of bearing a child with autism.
 
However, Tulfo noted that while experts in different parts of the world continue to conduct studies and research about autism, they are yet to find a scientific answer as to what causes autism in a baby.
 
Should SB. 752 be passed into law, Tulfo said the Department of Health (DOH), in collaboration with other government agencies, is tasked with conducting evidence-based research and epidemiological surveys to determine the cause, find medicine, and provide proper help and government subsidies to the families of persons with autism.
 
Under the bill, the DOH and Department of Education (DepEd) are likewise mandated to create a program for early screening and detection for children with developmental delays that can be attributed to autism.
 
This is also a way to ensure that the central PWD registry is updated.
 
SB 752 also seeks to protect persons with autism from discrimination and provide them with equal employment opportunities, as well as comfortable accommodation in accessing all types of transportation.

382,Arroyo wants to replace K to 12 with 'K + 10 + 2'; find out more,Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 26, 2023 ","House Senior Deputy Speaker and former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is proposing to replace the K to 12 education program with something that she calls K + 10 + 2.
Arroyo, Pampanga's 2nd district representative, goes into detail with her proposal in her measure, House Bill (HB) No.7893.
""This bill seeks to replace the present K to 12 education program in the country covering Kindergarten and 12 years of education with a K + 10 + 2 program covering compulsory Kindergarten and 10 years of basic education with, for those seeking to proceed to professional degree studies such as accounting, engineering, law, medicine, an additional two years of post-secondary, pre-university education,"" read then bill's explanatory note.
Then current K to 12 system was introduced by Arroyo's successor in Malacañang, the late former president Benigno S. Aquino III.
In HB No.7893, Arroyo recalled the justification for K to 12, which has its share of critics.
""Grades 11 and 12 were added to the country’s basic education program on the assumption that with the two additional years, senior high school (SHS) graduates should be able to immediately get a job, or put up their own business should they choose not to pursue college,"" she said.
""Unfortunately, the reality of the market seems to be that the private sector continues to prefer hiring college or university graduates over those who finish the K-to-12 program."" noted the former president.
Arroyo cited a December 2020 study by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), which said that only one in five senior high school graduates enter the labor force, with the rest opting to continue with their education.
""Anecdotal evidence indicates that they opt to continue with their education upon realizing that the private sector prefers to hire college of university graduates,"" the House leader said.
She said the PIDS study further revealed that in the labor market, there is “no clear advantage nor disadvantage [among] SHS (senior high school) graduates compared to [Grade 10] or second year college completers"".
Furthermore, Arroyo said, a 2022 Pulse Asia survey showed that a plurality of 44 percent of Filipinos said they were dissatisfied with the K to 12 system.
""The failure of the K to 12 program to provide its graduates with promised advantages exacerbates the additional burden on  parents and students imposed by two additional years of basic education,"" she said, citing a usual criticism on the current education system.
""In a country like the Philippines where the poverty incidence is 18 percent, there should be an option for the young to graduate from basic education soonest, after four years of high school, so that they can help their parents in their farms or micro-businesses,"" she said.
Arroyo went on to explain the ""+ 2"" in K + 10 + 2.
""If they want to go on to a professional education, that is when they can prepare themselves by having two years of post-secondary or pre-university education after high school to enhance their chances of succeeding in college or university and onward to professional licensure,"" she said.
""In the light of the foregoing, the immediate approval of this bill is earnestly requested,"" she said.
The full title of HB No.7893 reads, ""An Act amending Republic Act (RA) No.10533, entitled 'An Act enhancing the Philippine basic education system by strengthening its curriculum and increasing the number of years for basic education, appropriating funds therefor and for other purposes.'""
If and when enacted, Section 4 of RA No.10533 or the K to 12 law will be revised to read as follows: ""The enhanced basic education program encompasses at least one (1) year of kindergarten education, six (6) years of elementary education, and four (4) years of secondary education, in that sequence. Provided that, there shall be an additional two (2) years of post-secondary, pre-university education as preparation for professional degree studies.""
""Secondary education refers to the third stage of compulsory basic education. It consists of four (4) years of high school education,"" the proposed revision further reads.
This amends the law's current definition of secondary education, which ""refers to the third stage of compulsory basic education. It consists of four (4) years of junior high school education and two (2) years of senior high school education"".
Arroyo served as Philippine president from 2001 to 2010.

386,DepEd told: Blended learning not a ‘cure-all’ solution to education problems,Merlina Hernando-Malipot,"Apr 26, 2023 ","A group of education workers on Wednesday, April 26, warned the Department of Education (DepEd) against using blended learning as a “cure-all” solution to the problems in the basic education sector.

######
Blended learning, as defined by DepEd, refers to a learning delivery that “combines face-to-face with any or a mix of online distance learning, modular distance learning, and TV/Radio-based Instruction.”
During the school closures brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, blended learning was among the alternative delivery modalities used by schools to ensure that learning will continue.
However, the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) Philippines raised concerns over the DepEd’s “apparent instant prescription” of blended learning as the “solution to a myriad of problems that bog down the holding of in-person classes.”
ACT noted that the same modality “largely contributed” to the learning crisis in the country.
“Of late, blended learning has been the DepEd’s go-to solution for power outage, oil spill, and intolerable summer heat, even calling the modality an innovative approach to classroom and teacher shortage,” ACT Chairperson Vladimer Quetua.
“While it can be useful as a quick and temporary response when in-person classes are difficult to hold due to unforeseen circumstances, it should not be abused as the perennial solution, especially to problems caused by lack of foresight, poor planning and inadequate budget allocation,” he added.
ACT pointed out that distance learning problems continue to hound teachers and learners as they “remain unresolved after two years of its implementation—inadequacy of modules, lack of gadgets and internet support, and learning loss.”
This, Quetua added, will not bring the country closer to education recovery as “we need strategic solutions to the ailments of the education system.”
Quetua pointed out that “longer the government denies that education shortages should be seriously addressed, the more difficult the road to education recovery becomes.”
ACT reiterated the need to build adequate classrooms, hire more teachers and education support personnel, and provide classroom needs to improve learning conditions.
“These measures need the full fiscal support and staunch political will of the national government,” Quetua said.
“We also need to revert the school calendar to its pre-pandemic schedule at the soonest time possible for us to maximize the benefits of face-to-face classes,” he added.

Remulla said that once former Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) director general Gerald Q. Bantag surrenders, he will recommend his detention at the Philippine National Police’s (PNP) custodial center in Quezon City to ensure his safety.
Bantag has been tagged as fugitive from justice when he failed to surrender after two trial courts ordered his arrest on two murder cases filed against him and several others for the killings of radio broadcaster Percival ‘Percy Lapid” Mabasa and Bilibid inmate Cristito Villamor Palana, alleged “middleman” in the slaying of the journalist on Oct. 3, 2022 in Las Pinas City.
Remulla, himself, revealed Bantag’s intention to surrender.
“He (Bantag) spoke to one of my colleagues in the Cabinet to say that he may wish to surrender,” Remulla said.
The justice secretary said that Bantag’s “life will be under threat if he goes to a BJMP (Bureau of Jail Management and Penology) jail or any BuCor prison facility.”
“We will give him what is needed for his safety.” Remulla said.
“We will give him a few more days to show up if ever he wants to surrender. Otherwise, we will start clamping down. We will start the effort to arrest him,” he warned.
At the same time, Remulla said he had followed up with his Cabinet colleague on Bantag’s surrender feeler.

Joey Concepcion (Photo from Go Negosyo via Facebook)
In a statement, the RFM Corporation president and chief executive officer questioned the need for alert levels when the country is no longer under a State of Public Health Emergency, which lapsed last December 2022.
“The question we should be asking is why are we still implementing this alert level system when we are no longer under a State of Public Health Emergency?,” he asked.
Concepcion argued that alert levels are not being issued when there are high cases of dengue.
Instead, he said that, “We warn the public and increase awareness so that they will be more careful.”
“At this point we cannot afford any lockdowns or loss of confidence among our consumers. We need more mobility and spending if we want to see our GDP (gross domestic product) move higher. We have to remember that it is the economy that is at a higher risk now,” he added.
Earlier, the Inter-Agency Task for the Management (IATF) of Emerging Infectious Diseases put 56 of 82 provinces in the Philippines under Alert Level 1 until April 30.
Some provinces remained under Alert Level 2 since last year because of their low vaccination rates but despite their low Covid cases and hospital utilization rates.
But Concepcion, who led private sector efforts to secure vaccines for the Philippines and advocated for the gradual reopening of the economy at the height of the pandemic, argued that there is little evidence that the variant that is currently circulating should be a cause for concern
“This is still the Covid variant that is mild, even the doctors are saying that,” he said.
“At this point Filipinos know what to do. They are aware of the risks but are willing to take them because they are capable of managing them. Filipinos, especially the elderly and the vulnerable, know when situations are risky and they mask up,” he added.
The entrepreneur and economic adviser believes that the country has already “achieved a level of immunity that is both vaccine-induced and from getting exposed to Covid.”

389,Terrorism complaint is set for filing simultaneously with murder charges vs Rep Teves – Sec Remulla,Jeffrey Damicog,"Apr 26, 2023 ","The Department of Justice (DOJ) is set to file simultaneously terrorism complaint, multiple murder and other criminal charges against Negros Oriental 3rd District Rep. Arnolfo “Anie” A. Teves Jr. for the March 4 killings of nine persons, including Gov. Roel R. Degamo.
Teves has been tagged as “mastermind” in the slaying of Degamo.  While still abroad, Teves has denied the allegations against him.
Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin C. Remulla on Wednesday afternoon, April 26, said: “The case against Cong. Teves for multiple murder, multiple frustrated murder, multiple attempted murder will be filed very soon.  We will also file a case for terrorism simultaneous with the multiple murder cases.”
Remulla, who is a member of the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC), said the council convened on April 26.  “We started the process of designating Cong. Arnie Teves as a terrorist,” he said.
“A technical working group has been formed for this purpose to recommend the action of the Anti-Terror Council as to the designation of Arnie Teves,” he also said.
During the ATC meeting, Remulla said he answered questions of the council members concerning the designation of the Teves and his criminal group which he cited is provided for under Republic Act No. 11479, the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020.
“We are prepared for legal chances because there might be people who may legally challenge the use of the Anti-Terror Law for this purpose,” he said.
He said he pointed out to the ATC that Degamo was the highest elected government official in Negros Oriental.
“If a person with the rank of governor can be killed in his own home because of forces like this then who would not be terrorized by such an action,” he stressed.
The next ATC meeting will tackle the designation of Teves’ criminal group as part of the agenda.
He said there are at least four other persons who would be named as part of Teves’ terrorist group, one of them is Marvin H. Miranda, then bodyguard of the congressman, who was alluded to as the “casting director” in the plot to kill Degamo.
Once tagged as a terrorist, Remulla said “the duty of rendition comes in to the UN (United Nations) member states because he will be enrolled in the UN list of terrorists.”
“The duty of rendition is actually the duty to arrest the person who has been tagged as terrorist,” he explained.
Once Teves is designated as terrorist, Remulla said the ATC can also ask the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) to take action against him by moving “to freeze his assets.”
Earlier, Remulla had said that “the acts involving multiple murder and the fashion by which it was carried out including the recruitment of gunmen and use of high-powered firearms certainly falls within the coverage of the anti-terror law.”

390,"Hot weather, isolated rain showers, localized thunderstorms to prevail over most of PH",Ellalyn De Vera-Ruiz,"Apr 26, 2023 ","The easterlies or the warm air coming from the Pacific Ocean will still be the dominant weather system that may bring partly cloudy to cloudy weather and isolated rain showers or thunderstorms, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said on Wednesday afternoon, April 26.
In the next 24 hours, PAGASA said the easterlies and localized thunderstorms will mostly affect the Visayas and Mindanao.
PAGASA advised the public to remain vigilant as there can be flooding or landslides during severe thunderstorms, which are often associated with sudden heavy rains, lightning, thunder, gusts of wind, and sometimes hail.
Meanwhile, Luzon may continue to experience partly cloudy to cloudy weather.
PAGASA said the highest observed heat on Wednesday was 45 degrees Celsius (℃), which was recorded in Legazpi City, Albay.
Based on PAGASA’s definition, heat indices between 42°C and 51°C carry impending “danger” as “heat cramps and heat exhaustion are likely” and “heat stroke is probable with continued activity.”
Other areas that registered dangerous heat indices on Wednesday were Catarman, Northern Samar (43°C); Dagupan City, Pangasinan (43°C); Zamboanga City, Zamboanga del Sur (43°C); Roxas City, Capiz (42°C); and Sangley Pt., Cavite (42°C).
Heat index is the measurement of how hot it feels when relative humidity is factored in with the actual air temperature.

392,"Mayo zips mouth in House probe, invokes 'right to remain silent'",Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Congressmen who took part in the House panel probe on the controversial Manila drug bust tried, but failed, to wring out relevant information from detained former police master sergeant Rodolfo Mayo Jr. on Wednesday afternoon, April 26.
Mayo attended via Zoom the House Committee on Dangerous Drugs' hearing on the Oct. 8, 2022 drug bust wherein 990 kilos of shabu were confiscated inside WPD Lending office located along A. Bonifacio St., Tondo, Manila.
Mayo reportedly owns the company, making him a focal person of the investigation in aid of legislation.
However, the dismissed cop--wearing a yellow Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) shirt--repeatedly invoked his ""right to remain silent"" and ""right against self-incrimination"" when asked even the most basic questions by the solon-interpellators.
Throwing questions at Mayo were panel chairman and Surigao del Norte 2nd district Rep. Robert Ace Barbers, Antipolo 2nd district Rep. Romeo Acop, Batangas 2nd district Rep. Gerville Luistro, and ACT Teachers Party-list Rep. France Castro.
Congressmen are suspecting that there is a cover-up on the Oct. 8 operation as well as an attempt to recycle the large haul of seized drugs. This suspicion was somewhat strengthened by the contradicting accounts of attending police officials as to the exact time and place that Mayo was arrested.
Realizing that Mayo wasn't likely to cooperate with them, Acop, a former police brigadier general, tried to talk some sense into him.
""Alam mo na ba ang mangyayari sayo?...ako, na-charge ako ng multiple murder in 1995. Inilaban ko yung kaso ko. 19 years thereafter, nanalo ako sa Korte Suprema. Hindi ko alam kung may pag-asa kang manalo (Do you know what will happen to you?...as for me, I was charged with multiple murder in 1995. I fought for my case. 19 years thereafter, I won in the Supreme Court. I don't know if you have a chance of winning),"" Acop told Mayo.
The solon said that Mayo technically cannot invoke such rights on questions that have nothing to do with his case. The Philippine National Police-Drug Enforcement Group (PDEG) had earlier filed criminal charges against Mayo.
""Naisip mo rin ba kung ano mangyayari sa pamilya mo (Have you thought of what would happen to your family)?' Acop said, as if prodding the embattled cop to ""sing"".
""My apologies your honor. I invoke my right to remain silent,"" answered Mayo, to which the veteran congressman responded, ""Mr. Chair, ayoko na (I quit).""
Mayo, however, described the charges filed against him as ""moro-moro"", or just for show.
""Mga moro-moro na kaso, your honor (These cases are just for show, your honor),"" Mayo told Barbers during the latter's interpellation.
But when Barbers asked him to elaborate, the dismissed cop once again invoked his right to remain silent.
Mayo also chose to stay silent when Barbers asked where he was arrested.




"
393,PAGASA not ruling out possible ‘strong’ El Niño this year,Ellalyn De Vera-Ruiz,"Apr 26, 2023 ","The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) is not discounting the possibility that the looming El Niño could reach “strong” intensity by the end of 2023, which means its impact could be more severe than a mild event.
In the PAGASA’s climate outlook forum on Wednesday, April 26, PAGASA weather specialist Rusy Abastillas said there is a 41 percent chance that the El Niño phenomenon this year may become a strong event.
“For the strength of this El Niño event, it [the forecast] shows that the probability for a weak to moderate El Niño is more than 50 percent, 87 percent na magiging (that it will) be weak, and 67 percent na magiging (that it will be) moderate,” Abastillas said.
“But there is also a 41 percent chance na puwede siyang maging (that it may become) strong by November-December-January. So makikita pa rin natin na there is still a chance na puwede siya maging strong, but as of now mas mataas ‘yung weak to moderate probability for this El Niño. (So we are seeing that there is still a chance for this to be strong, but as of now the weak-to-moderate probability for this El Niño is higher),” she added.
The last El Niño episode was in 2018-2019, which was weak.
Abastillas cited three historical El Niño events that have similar conditions to the looming El Niño.
“‘Yung similar conditions of the forecasted El Niño event this year is puwedeng nating maihahalintulad sa 2004-2005 El Niño, which is also weak El Niño. Nagstart siya ng June-July-August and nag-end ng January-February-March, or ‘yung moderate El Niño noong 2002 and 2003 na nag-start ng May-June-July at nag-end ng January-February-March (The similar conditions of this year’s expected El Niño event are comparable to the 2004-2005 El Niño, which was also a weak El Niño. It started in June-July-August and ended in January-February-March, or the moderate El Niño in 2002 and 2003, which started in May-June-July and ended in January-February-March),” she said.
She noted that the last strong El Niño was in 2009-2010, which occurred after a La Niña event.
The 21st century’s first “triple-dip” La Niña or La Niña event that occurred for three consecutive years has only occurred from 2021 to 2023. This rare phenomenon also happened in 1973-1976 and 1998-2001.
Abastillas pointed out that the PAGASA will upgrade its advisory from “El Niño Watch” to “El Niño Alert” next month.
This means that the probability of El Niño developing in the next couple of months has increased to 80 percent.
“A transition from ENSO-neutral [where neither La Niña nor El Niño persists] to El Niño is favored during the May-June-July 2023 season, with chances of El Niño increasing towards the first quarter of 2024,” Abastillas said.
El Niño, or warm phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), is characterized by unusually warmer than average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific.
PAGASA said this climate phenomenon increases the possibility of below-normal rainfall conditions, which may cause negative effects, such as drought and dry spell, in some areas of the country.

394,"Lazada snubs DTI warnings as PMA urges gov’t to fight illicit tobacco, vapes",Manila Bulletin,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Lazada continues to turn a blind eye to warnings issued by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) as the Philippines’ most prominent medical group asked the Senate and other government agencies to stop the sale of illicit cigarettes and vaping products that continue to proliferate in popular online marketplaces.
Online listings of unregistered and unverified vape products remain live on the Lazada platform despite DTI warning against the sale of illicit tobacco and vapes online.
“We are bedazzled why these non-compliant, unregistered and possible non-tax paid tobacco and vapor products are allowed to be openly advertised, sold and distributed in the local market, especially online,” the Philippine Medical Association (PMA) said in a letter addressed to Senator Pia Cayetano.
Copies of the letter were also sent to the DTI, Department of Health (DOH), the Department of Finance (DOF), Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) and other relevant agencies.
The medical group asked the government agencies to “stand together and act against illicit tobacco and vapor products” on Lazada, Shopee and Facebook Marketplace to protect the public from harm.
The DTI, through its Consumer Protection Group, earlier met with high-level e-commerce industry representatives to address the spread of prohibited vaporized nicotine and non-nicotine products advertised and sold online.
Shopee immediately reported the removal of more than 1 million prohibited vape listings from its website a day after the meeting with DTI.  Lazada still had listings of the illicit products as this was being written.
In their letter, the PMA thanked Cayetano for her “unwavering commitment to protecting the welfare of the Filipino people, particularly with regards to the issue on tobacco and vapor products” and her committee for exposing the “huge presence of illicit vapor products in the Philippine market, particularly those found in online platforms.”
The doctors’ group expressed alarm at illicit and unregistered tobacco and vape products dodging regulatory oversight and thus endangering the public.
The letter referenced numerous postings on e-retailer platforms of tobacco and vape products that do not bear Philippine graphic health warnings and are sold below retail value.
“There is no way to verify if the products sold are registered and paid the correct taxes… since they do not bear the internal revenue stamps nor the required packaging or labeling requirements,” the PMA said.
“Raising the issue on illicit tobacco and vapor products and calling for the full implementation of the tax and regulatory laws on these products is crucial in protecting the interests of the government and the public,” it said.
Noting the higher excise taxes levied on vaporized nicotine and non-nicotine products since 2020, the PMA said there was “no reason why any importer or manufacturer will be able to evade paying taxes three years later.”
Cayetano was also requested to intercede with the DILG and all local chief executives to actively campaign against illicit vapor products.
Taguig City serves as the headquarters of e-commerce giants Shopee, Facebook and Lazada. Taguig Mayor Laarni “Lani” Cayetano is Pia Cayetano’s sister-in-law.
In a public hearing conducted in February 2023 by the Senate Committee on Sustainable Development Goals, Innovation and Future Thinking chaired by Cayetano, the DTI said it had issued show cause orders to regional and provincial offices of online selling platforms to boost its campaign against the sale of vape and e-cigarette products that are found in violation of Republic Act (RA) 11900 or the Vape Law.

395,Persons affected by Oriental Mindoro oil spill may get total of $284-M in compensation -- DOJ,Jeffrey Damicog,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Persons affected by the oil spill in Oriental Mindoro may receive only a total of $284 million payment from the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds (IOPC), the Department of Justice (DOJ) said on Wednesday, April 26.
“The maximum coverage for the oil spill based on the IOPC would only be up to 203 million SDR (special drawing rights) or in United States dollars it would be $284million,” said DOJ Undersecretary Raul T. Vasquez during an interview on ANC.
Vasquez explained the recoverable amount is pursuant to the Protocol of the International Convention for Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage where the Philippines is a state party.
He said that the IOPC has “some kind of mutual fund” that is “participated in by all maritime industry member states.”
“Everybody contributes and the fund would be the source of the payment for all the claims in respect to oil pollution,” he also said.
The DOJ has been leading the inter-agency dialogue over the oil spill caused by MT Princess Empress which sank off the waters of Oriental Mindoro last Feb. 28 after allegedly ignoring gale warnings.
The latest dialogue was held Tuesday, April 25, at the DOJ which was attended for the first time by IOPC Director Gaute Sivertsen.
Vasquez noted there is an ongoing compensation caravan at the affected areas in Oriental Mindoro.
“That is the reason why the IOPC sent its representatives recently and the idea is for them to verify, to go to the ground and check the veracity of claims,” he said.
“They would then bring all these claims to the United Kingdom where the IOPC holds office for the vetting, assessment and verification of all the claims,” he added.
He pointed out that anybody affected by the oil spill is entitled to file his or her claim.
He said, however, that “the claims that are on the table are just claims from the affected fisherfolks in respect to lost income and all that.”
The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) “has estimated the claims at P500 million already for the fisherfolks,” he said.  The government also intends to seek compensation for restoration efforts, he added.
“There will be an inter-agency determination of how much would the claim be against the IOPC funds,” he stressed.
Vasquez noted that there are three levels of compensation provided for under the Convention with the first level to be provided for by the ship owner through the insurer.
“With respect to the insurer, there is a so-called amount of 4.5 million special drawing rights,” he said.  Should the compensation being asked breaches this amount, he said only then that the $284 million will be tapped.
He said there is an existing protocol that would allow the payment of up to 750 SDR. But “the Philippines is not a signatory to that,” he lamented.

397,"AFP, US counterpart's live fire drill a success as mock vessel sinks off Zambales",Martin Sadongdong,"Apr 26, 2023 ","The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the United States Armed Forces declared as successful the conduct of Balikatan combined joint littoral live fire exercise in San Antonio, Zambales on Wednesday, April 26, when it achieved its objective to sink a mock vessel.

Col. Michael Logico, executive agent for the Philippine side of the Exercise Balikatan 2023, said BRP Pangasinan (PS-31) sank at 2:55 p.m. when an F-35B Joint Strike Fighters aircraft of the US delivered a laser-guided bomb to it.
BRP Pangasinan, a World War II-era corvette, represented an enemy force approaching the Philippine territory by sea during the exercise. The vessel was decommissioned by the Philippine Navy in 2021.
“It will not be fair to give all the credit to the US Air Force because a lot of the other aircraft and navy ships also contributed to the sinking of BRP Pangasinan. But what delivered the final salvo was the F-35,” Logico said.
He said that the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) that were fired by the troops during the earlier part of the drill did not hit the target. These rockets were supposed to sink the vessel.
“Even before the exercise, we were also not sure if the HIMARS will hit since it is a ground-based and area weapon, not a precision weapon,” Logico said.
Aside from this, several other concerns have to be considered such as the location of BRP Pangasinan.
“The ex-PS31 was not anchored because it is too deep: 6,000 feet. So it was drifting,” he said.
The officer also mentioned that there were two intruders which delayed the exercise, and not one as earlier reported. One was an aerial interloper which was a private unregistered single craft aircraft that flew in the middle of the ocean near the operational area while the other one was a boat. 
“This resulted to the delay since they [troops] have to recompute [the location] and because of the drift, they found it hard to hit PS-31,” he said.

398,Marcos vows to improve PH agri sector,Argyll Cyrus Geducos,"Apr 26, 2023 ","President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has vowed to “fix” the country’s agriculture industry as he met with members of the private stakeholders in Malacañang to discuss ways to further improve and strengthen the agriculture sector. 

In a tweet, the President assured the public that the administration is working towards having a productive agriculture sector.
“Bawat aspeto, kabilang ang panlipunan, pangkapaligiran at pang-ekonomiya, ay ating isinasaayos upang makamit ang isang matibay at produktibong sektor ng agrikultura (We’re fixing every aspect, including societal, environmental, and economical, to achieve a strong and productive agriculture sector),” he said. 
Marcos said he listened to the recommendations of the private sector stakeholders to transform the country’s agriculture sector.
“Pinakinggan natin ang mga rekomendasyon ng pribadong sektor para sa transpormasyon ng ating agrikultura, maging ang mga update sa Kapatid Angat Lahat for Agricultural Program (KALAP) na layuning itaguyod ang kabuhayan ng ating mga magsasaka, mangingisda at maliliit na negosyante (We listened to the recommendations of the private sector for the transformative of our agriculture industry, along with updates on KALAP that aims to promote the livelihood of our farmers, fishers, and small business owners),” Marcos said.

KALAP is a public-private sector initiative that aims to transform the country's agriculture industry by integrating small farmers into the value chain of large agribusiness companies.
During its launch in early March, President Marcos said the private sector-led initiative KALAP would enable farmers and the country's micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to become ""more productive, profitable, sustainable, and globally competitive.""
“We know very well how MSMEs are crucial in the creation of new ideas, of jobs and wealth in the country, so it is only right that we recognize the power and the influence that this sector holds,"" the President said in his speech at the ceremonial signing of a memorandum of agreement on the KALAP program in Malacañang.


""We also recognize the role of big corporations in [innovating] MSMEs, spurring their growth, and realizing their potential. Hence, I am very happy to note the objective of the KALAP to integrate small farmers and agri-entrepreneurs into the value chain of large companies,"" the President pointed out.

399,'Bigger than a foreign drug lord?' Solons stumped over how Mayo gathered nearly a ton of 'shabu',Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Exactly how was former police master sergeant Rodolfo Mayo Jr. able to gather nearly a ton of ""shabu"" inside WPD Lending office, the site of a police operation on Oct. 8, 2022?
Antipolo City 2nd district Rep. Romeo Acop highlighted this incredible detail on Wednesday, April 26 and wondered whether or not this had caught the eye Philippine National Police (PNP) officials.
""I do not know if the PNP or the authorities in charge of these are alarmed by the fact that a non-commissioned officer of the PNP has in his possession one ton of illegal drugs....police na ang may hawak. Hindi ba kayo nagtataka doon (A policeman has this in his possession. Doesn't it make you wonder)?"" asked Acop during the House Committee on Dangerous Drugs' hearing on the controversial Tondo, Manila drug bust.
On Oct. 8, 2022, police operatives found during a ""follow-up operation"" some 990 kilos of shabu at the WPD Lending office located along A. Bonifacio St., Tondo, Manila. Mayo reportedly owned the company.
""In the case of sergeant Mayo, wala akong makita na Chinese man lang ho (there wasn't even a Chinese personality) [or] he has in his possession one ton of illegal drugs. Saan kaya nanggaling yun? Hindi ko alam kung iniimbestigahan ng PNP yun (Where did that come from? I don't know of the PNP is investigating that),"" the Antipolo lawmaker noted.
""Saan ba nanggaling yang 990 kilos na yan? Wala tayong report na drug laboratory here. Wala naman nirereport ang customs (Where did the 990 kilos come from? There are no reports of a drug laboratory here. There is no report from customs either). How did 990 kilos or more entered this country?"" he further asked.

It was learned during the hearing that the 990 kilos of shabu were found in a vault inside WPD Lending office.
Surigao del Norte 2nd district Rep. Robert Ace Barbers, the committee chairman, agreed with Acop's observation that it was quite shocking for someone like Mayo to have in his possession such a huge cache of illegal drugs.
""Ayon sa narration ng ating officials, parang aksidenteng nadiscover during a follow-up sa WPD Lending office (According to the narration of our officials, the shabu was somewhat accidentally discovered during a follow-up at WPD Lending office),"" he said.
""Isang tonelada yung hawak niya eh. Baka mas malaki pa siya doon sa Instik na drug lord na nahuhuli natin minsan (He was holding one ton of shabu. He appears to be bigger than the Chinese drug lords that we sometimes catch),"" added Barbers.
The 990 kilos of shabu are valued at a whopping P6.7 billion.
Mayo, who is detained at Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City, attended Wednesday's hearing via Zoom.

401,Bishop asks for prayers for more vocations to the priesthood,Christina Hermoso,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines- Episcopal Commission on Vocations chairman Novaliches Bishop Roberto Gaa is asking the faithful for prayers for more vocations to the priesthood.
Bishop Gaa cited the need for the lay faithful to support and inspire the youth to be willing to serve the Lord and the Church.
“Let us pray for more vocations to the priesthood. Let us be active in supporting the Church by offering and encouraging young men to serve God,” the prelate said over Radio Veritas.
The Roman Catholic Church is set to observe World Day of Prayer for Vocations on Sunday, April 30, to coincide with Good Shepherd Sunday.
The Diocese of Novaliches will observe a Holy Hour for Vocations on Saturday, April 29, at 8 p.m. to be led by Fr. Marvin Riquez, national coordinator of the Diocesan Vocation Director in the Philippines.
Fr. Riquez, for his part said, vocations to the priesthood in the country continue to flourish because of the support and prayers of the faithful. The priest invited the public to join in the observance of the Holy Hour for Vocations which will be held at the Sta. Lucia Parish in Novaliches will be shown live through the diocese’s Facebook page.
To date, the county has about 10,000 priests looking after the spiritual needs of more than 80 million Catholics in the 86 archdioceses, dioceses, prelatures, and vicariates around the country.
The theme for the 60th World Day of Prayer for Vocations is “Pray the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into his harvest” from the Gospels of Saints Matthew and Luke.

402,AFP says PH has right to hold drills within territory as 'intruder' delays Balikatan main event,Martin Sadongdong,"Apr 26, 2023 ","The Philippines has an “inherent and invaluable” right to conduct military exercises within its own territory.
 
(HIMARS rockets are fired during the combined joint littoral live fire exercise of Exercise Balikatan 2023 in San Antonio, Zambales on April 26, 2023. Photo by Noel Pabalate / MANILA BULLETIN)
This was stressed by Colonel Michael Logico, executive agent for the Philippine side of the Exercise Balikatan 2023, after the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the United States Armed Forces conducted a combined joint littoral live fire exercise in San Antonio, Zambales on Wednesday, April 26, which served as the main event of this year's Balikatan.
“We are exercising inside of our territorial waters and inside of our territorial airspace and that is our inherent and invaluable right to exercise within our territory,” Logico told reporters after the live fire drill. 
The exercise was highlighted by the sinking of former Philippine Navy corvette BRP Pangasinan (PS-31) at 12 nautical miles from the shoreline through the firing of rockets, artilleries, and other aviation weapons. 
The location of the ship is well within the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Philippines. The exercise was also held at approximately 100 nautical miles from Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal which was seized by China from the Philippines in a tense standoff in 2012.
Logico said he would not want to anticipate China’s reaction to the AFP and US military’s joint drills near the Scarborough Shoal. “I cannot speak for them (China),” he said.
But the Balikatan main event was marked by a surprising delay when the radars of the AFP and US military detected an aerial intruder flying within the operational area where the sinking exercise was being held. The interloper was later identified as a “a private unregistered single craft aircraft.”
Logico said they had to delay the firing of the rockets to sink BRP Pangasinan since it could pose danger to the interloper.
“Safety is always a primary consideration when we conduct the exercise. Any interloper or any intrusion into the exercise that will endanger the lives of people, whether its intentional or accidental, is our primary consideration. As a general SOP [standard operating procedure] we lift fires every time that there is an interloper to our territory,” he said.
It has yet to be determined whether the aircraft got inside the operational area by mere accident or intentionally as a form of sabotage.
“We are not sure if it was intentional or accidental so I will not need to jump for a conclusion,” Logico said.
Meanwhile, Col. Jackson Doan, from the US Marine Corps Forces Pacific, said the live fire exercise was meant to develop the interoperability of the forces from the Philippines and US militaries so they can work together in future scenarios.
“The message is not geared toward anything outside of the strong relationship and bond with the Philippines. The message is very simple,” Doan said.
“We’ve been called upon to train together and we learn from that. That key element of partnership and resolve is far stronger than any other measures and technical prowess, any other measure of exploding targets or any other measure of offensive and defensive capability,” he continued.
“The resolve in partnership is far stronger than any technical element that we have and that’s the true message of Balikatan, in translation shoulder to shoulder. That doesn’t mean weapon to weapon. It really means family,” he added.

Under the agreement,  the DPWH applications and systems will be integrated to the DICT through the e-governance.
The DPWH, on the other hand, will guide DICT on the Department’s processes to ensure the interoperability of their respective systems and application.
In coordination with DPWH, the DICT will also study, evaluate and facilitate the development of additional applications and systems, if needed.
""This initiative of DICT in improving government efficiency through e-governance is a welcome development as DPWH will be able to among others, accept online payments for various services, such as purchase of bidding documents, testing fees, accreditation fees, permit application fees, and other fees, said DPWH Secretary Manuel Bonoan.
“By embracing digital transformation, we will be able to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations, while also making our services more accessible to the public,” he added.

404,Sandigan affirms conviction of ex-Quezon town mayor,Czarina Nicole Ong Ki,"Apr 26, 2023 ","The Sandiganbayan has affirmed the conviction of former mayor Joselito R. Alega of San Francisco town in Quezon for violation of Article 244 of the Revised Penal Code on unlawful appointment.
Alega was found guilty of appointing Rosauro P. Fernandez as municipal administrator in 2013 despite lack of qualifications.  He was sentenced to a prison term of one month and one day and ordered to pay a fine of P1,000. He filed a motion for reconsideration.
However, Alega was acquitted on a graft charge in connection with the same appointment.
In his motion, he told the court that the charge sheet against him failed to sufficiently apprise him of the nature and cause of the accusation, and the prosecution also failed to prove bad faith with moral certainty.
But the Sandiganbayan denied his motion.  “His claim that his conviction is unfair and underhanded, allegedly because the Information... did not sufficiently apprise him of the nature and the cause of the accusation against him, is patently erroneous.”
The court said that Alega ""knowingly"" appointed Fernandez even if the latter did not possess all the qualifications provided for under the Local Government Code.
It pointed out that good faith is not a valid defense for Article 244 of the Revised Penal Code. Having already extensively discussed this in its assailed decision, the court said ""there is no useful purpose"" for it to repeat the same in the resolution.
The resolution was written by Sixth Division Chairperson Sarah Jane T. Fernandez with the concurrence of Associate Justices Karl B. Miranda and Kevin Narce B. Vivero.

405,"13-inch screens, 'send-to-all' system: Comelec's bid for transparency in 2025",Dhel Nazario,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Machines with 13-inch screens and a ""send-to-all"" system are just some of the capabilities that Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chairman George Erwin Garcia disclosed for the 2025 elections in a bid to continuously ensure transparency.
During the Manila City Hall Reporters’ Association's (MACHRA) 'Balitaan sa Harbor View', Garcia stated that these screens will allow voters to verify if their votes have indeed been counted, stating that these machines will ensure better transparency and faster results as well.
The ""send-to-all"" system, on the other hand, means that results will be transmitted to concerned parties all at once and all at the same time.
“Kung ito yung vote counting machine (VCM) ng isang presinto, itong machine na ito pag nagpadala magpapadala sa city hall kung saan kina-canvass (election results), magpapadala sa PPCRV, magpapadala sa citizens’ arm,  sa KBP, sa majority party, sa minority party, sa Congress so send to all (This VCM in a particular precincet will transmit to the city hall where [election results] are being canvassed; to the PPCRV; to the citizens' arm; to KBP, to the majority party; the minority party; and to Congress so it's sent to all),"" Garcia explained.
In a text message to Manila Bulletin, Garcia said that these are the specifications indicated in their proposal under their Terms of Reference (TOR).
""Ngayon, kung isa dun magsalita na iba ang kanyang result, bahala siya sa buhay niya samantalang lahat, pare-parehas (Now if one of them says that they got a different result, that's up to them since everyone else got the same),” he added.
He mentioned that he does not see a better form of transparency than that.
Garcia said that in order to satisfactorily address the questions commonly being raised by the voters, he had come up with a way so that voters themselves can verify if the ballots they filled out and entered into the machine have indeed been counted.
He also stated there can be a hybrid system within a single machine,  not the kind where the machine was used after which the ballots will be counted manually and where the images of the ballots may be viewed front and back.
“Hindi hybrid na minachine mo tapos binilang mo isa-isa. ‘Yun ang purpose kung me screen na malaki, kung kaya 15-17 inches mas maganda (It's not hybrid in terms that there will be a machine and then it will be manually counted. That's the prupose of the big screen, if 15 to 17 inches will be available, the better),” Garcia said.
He mentioned that under the system, watchers may take pictures of the ballots and later on, do their own counting but by that time, the machine must have already transmitted to avoid any delay in the canvassing.
The Comelec chair said the poll body is fast-tracking the terms of reference in the hope that by July, there will already be a procurement short of award, stressing that the priority will be to train, introduce or educate how the people will vote under the new system using the new machines.
“Kasi kung maganda nga ‘yung makina, kung hindi naman nauunawaan ng tao, hindi rin po sila basta makakaboto nang maayos. (Because if the machine is indeed good, but the voters will not understand how to use it, they will not be able to vote properly). Trust will always begin with voters’ education and information,” he added.

406,"OWWA, DOLE urged to provide alternative livelihood programs for displaced Sudan OFWs ​",Hannah Torregoza,"Apr 26, 2023 "," 
 
Senator Jinggoy Ejercito Estrada on Wednesday, April 26 urged the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) to ensure that overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Sudan who have been displaced in the armed struggle in Sudan would be given livelihood assistance. 
 
Estrada, chairperson of the Senate Committee on Labor and Employment, likewise called on the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and other concerned agencies to prepare alternative sources of livelihood for the OFWs who will be repatriated, including undocumented workers.
 
“Asahan na natin na karamihan sa mga OFWs na napilitang umuwi ng wala sa oras dahil sa tumitinding kaguluhan sa Sudan ay walang ipon. Baka matagalan pa bago sila makapag-relocate para makipagsapalaran sa ibang bansa (Let's expect that most OFWs who were forced to return home prematurely due to the escalating conflict in Sudan have no savings. It may take a long time before they can relocate to venture abroad),” Estrada said in a statement.
 
“For the meantime, makabubuti siguro na mabahagian sila ng tulong ng gobyerno. May nakalaan tayong pondo para sa mga katulad nilang distressed o displaced OFWs (For the meantime, it might be good for them to receive government assistance. We have funds set aside for distressed or displaced OFWs like them),” the senator stressed. 
 
Estrada noted that under the 2023 national budget, P431-million had been allocated specifically under the OWWA’s Balik Pinas, Balik Hanapbuhay Program (BPBH).
 
BPBH, a package of livelihood support and assistance, covers returning OWWA member-OFWs who were displaced or distressed from their jobs, he pointed out. 
 
A maximum of P20,000 is given to covered active and non-active OWWA members as startups or additional capital for the expansion of their already existing business, the lawmaker said.
 
At least 325 out of the estimated 700 OFWs in Sudan have requested the government for repatriation from the war-torn country.
 
“May programa ang gobyerno na makakatulong  sa mga kagaya nila na nawalan ng trabaho sa ibang bansa at mainam na mabigyan sila ng ng ganitong klase ng ayuda ng sa gayon ay patuloy nilang matustusan ang gastusin ng kanilang pamilya (The government has a program that can help people like them who have lost their jobs in other countries and it would be good to give them this kind of aid so that they can continue to support their family's expenses),” he said.
 
“Sa ganitong paraan, hindi sila daragdag sa bilang ng mga unemployed nating mga kababayan (In this way, they will not add to the number of our unemployed countrymen),” he emphasized.

407,PBBM accepts proposals on sustainable agri-business,Raymund Antonio,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Amid the challenges faced by the agriculture sector, President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. on Tuesday, April 25, welcomed members of private agribusinesses  to hear their recommendations about how to create a sustainable and business-conducive industry.
The President, who sits as Agriculture secretary in a concurrent capacity, presided over a meeting with the private sector to discuss, among others, updates on the Kapatid Angat Lahat for Agricultural Program (KALAP), a program by Go Negosyo and its founder, Joey Concepcion, to bridge small farmers to big agribusinesses.
The meeting at the Aguinaldo State Dining Room in Malacañang Palace showed the Chief Executive and the private sector both recognizing the potentials of agriculture as “one of the main drivers of economic growth in the country.”
“President Marcos Jr. expresses his appreciation for a very insightful discussion on the matter and assures the private sector of the government’s commitment in developing more holistic approaches in addressing key issues encompassing economic, social and environmental aspects of the agricultural sector,” state-run Radio Television Malacañang (RTVM) said in a post, accompanied by a short video clip of the meeting.
The private sector had several recommendations; among which are improvement on the loan and farm financing program, proper implementation of Agri-Agra laws, technical trainings for farmers, and more postharvest facilities in the country.
Concepcion, the main proponent of the KALAP initiative, noted the many challenges of the agriculture sector, as well as their impact on farmers.
While he expressed “gratitude” to Marcos for giving the private sector a platform to share their insights about the industry, he pushed for the strengthening of the ties between the public and private sectors through the Public-Private Partnership (PPP).
For him, this would “enable deeper cooperation in attaining sustainable development and transformation in the agricultural sector for the benefit of Filipino farmers and consumers.”
Under the KALAP program, small farmers would be incorporated into the value chain of large agribusiness companies or big-brother companies.

408,Filipino diplomats heading to evacuate Filipinos in Sudan unhurt in car accident,Joseph Pedrajas,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Two Philippine diplomats figured in a car accident while on the way to assist in the evacuation of Filipinos in Sudan amid deadly fighting between its military and paramilitary forces.
Philippine Ambassador to Egypt Ezzedin Tago and Vice Consul Bojer Capati were involved in an accident as they were heading to the Egyptian border with Sudan, Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) spokesperson Ma. Teresita Daza said Wednesday.
DFA Undersecretary Eduardo Jose de Vega said Tago and Capati's vehicle rolled over twice while rushing for their operation.
The two were unhurt, the two officials said.
Tago has already returned to Cairo, according to Daza, and will be flying again to the border ""to facilitate the entry of  Filipino evacuees to Egypt.""
Meanwhile, Capati will do the same after getting clearance from the hospital, de Vega said.
The two Egypt-based diplomats are carrying out the operations after at least 350 Filipinos in Sudan requested for rescue and evacuations as the warring factions declared a 72-hour ceasefire.
The Philippine Embassy in Cairo has jurisdiction over Khartoum, which is located over 2,000 kilometers away.
The government is struggling to get Filipinos out of Sudan due to ""scarcity"" of available buses and their ""increasing rental prices,"" the DFA said.
But so far, 80 Filipinos were already evacuated while seven buses have already been contracted for Filipino evacuees, DFA added.

409,NFA rice buffer stocks should only be available in selected areas—Hontiveros,Hannah Torregoza,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Senator Risa Hontiveros on Wednesday, April 26 has found it unnecessary for the government to raise rice buffer stocks in National Food Authority (NFA) warehouses in preparation for the El Niño or the prolonged dry weather season that is expected to develop early in May.
 
Hontiveros said it would be better for the government to go directly to local rice producers.
 
“Kaya kung dadagdagan man ang bigas sa warehouses ng National Food Authority, mas mabuting sa lokal na producers (So, if there is a need to increase rice stocks in the warehouses of the NFA, it is better to tap local producers),”  Hontiveros said in a statement.
 
“Tama ang NEDA na dapat para lang sa mga piling lokalidad ang prepositioning ng NFA rice stocks — yung mga isolated at maaaring makaranas ng shortage at pagsirit ng presyo (The National Economic Development Authority is right that the prepositioning of NFA rice stocks should only be for selected localities — those that are isolated and may experience shortages and price spikes),” she pointed out. 
 
Hontiveros said government should avoid a repeat of the massacre that happened in Kidapawan City in 2016, where thousands of farmers and their supporters blockaded the Davao-Cotabato Road and protested before the NFA office in Kidapawan City to air their grievances.
 
The demonstration ended violently with three deaths on the side of protesters and a total of 116 injured on both sides after police tried to disperse the mass action. 
 
During that time, protesters condemned the non-distribution of NFA rice stocks despite the declaration of a state of calamity by the local government unit (LGU) that is reeling from the drought caused by the El Niño.
 
“Maybe the economic managers should more rigorously justify why raising the stock of rice in NFA warehouses makes more sense than other programs that could protect families that might experience loss of livelihoods and hunger,” Hontiveros pointed out.
 
“Dapat munang siguraduhin na may nakalaang ayuda sa mga mahihirap nating kababayan. Noong El Niño ng 2016, maraming laman ang mga warehouses ng NFA, pero ang problema ay walang pambili ang mga mahihirap. (We must first make sure that there is dedicated aid for our poor countrymen. During the El Niño of 2016, the NFA warehouses were full, but the problem was that the poor had nothing to buy),” she said.
 
“Hindi na dapat maulit ang nangyaring karahasan sa Kidapawan dahil ayaw buksan para sa mga nagugutom ang warehouses (The violence that happened in Kidapawan should not be repeated because the warehouses do not want to be opened for the hungry),” added the lawmaker.
 
Moreover, Hontiveros cited reports that sanitary and phytosanitary clearances have already been issued for more than three (3) million metric tons of rice to be imported by the private sector and nearly one-third of this has already arrived. 
 
“Sapat yan para punan ang inaasahang kakulangan sa lokal na produksyon (That is enough to fill the expected shortfall in local production),” she said.
 
“Likewise, we know that the price of fertilizers has already gone down dramatically and the budgets for inputs and irrigation for  the rice sector have been more than doubled for this year,” the lawmaker also recalled.
 
“Sapat dapat ito para makapaghanda ng masaganang ani dahil sa dulo pa naman ng taon tatama ang El Nino (This should be enough to prepare a rich harvest because El Nino will hit at the end of the year),” she pointed out.

410,'Clean the house': Revilla urges new PNP Chief Acorda,Mario Casayuran,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Senator Ramon Bong Revilla Jr. on Wednesday, April 26, challenged newly designated Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief Major General Benjamin C. Acorda Jr. to clean the organization and immediately put its affairs in order.
Revilla issued the dare after issues affecting the integrity of the PNP were unearthed and these came to light one after the other.
""Kailangang unahin ni Chief PNP Acorda na isaayos ang institusyon (PNP Chief Acorda should prioritize the cleaning of the organization),"" he said. ""At kasama niya kami dito (We are with you here),"" he added.
""The bad elements should be weeded out immediately at panagutin (and be held responsible).” ""Ilan lang 'yang mga masasama sa organisasyon at hindi na dapat lalo pang makapanira (The bad elements who were able to enter the force should not be allowed to destroy the organization),” he stressed.
Revilla was referring to the revelations in the hearings conducted by the Senate Committee on Public Order and Illegal Drugs chaired by Senator Ronald ""Bato"" Dela Rosa on the assassination of Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo.
He cited testimonies that some members of the PNP have apparently become subservient to politicians and political interests which struck a heavy blow to the national police force.
The veteran lawmaker also mentioned the upcoming inquiry of the same Senate Committee into the alleged cover-up of the P6.7 billion drug operation last year where a police officer - Police Master Sgt. Rodolfo MayoJr. - was arrested.
""Kailangan natin ibalik ang tiwala ng publiko sa ating pulisya (We need to return the trust of the public to the police force),"" Revilla stressed.
""Wala namang matatakbuhan ang ating mga kababayan para sa peace and order, kaya dapat iayos natin pare-pareho at ibangon ang institusyon (Our countrymen have no one to turn to on peace and order matters except the police, that is why we should put the PNP as an institution in order) ,” he explained.
""That can only happen if there is transparency and accountability. Panagutin ang mga dapat managot (Those responsible should be held accountable),’’ he added.

411,"DSWD to open AICS satellite offices in Caloocan, Parañaque",Ellalyn De Vera-Ruiz,"Apr 26, 2023 ","The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) will open new satellite offices for the processing of its Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation (AICS) program, mainly to serve residents of Metro Manila and neighboring provinces.
“This initiative is one way to decongest our existing AICS payout areas, and to deliver services under AICS directly to our clients from different parts of Metro Manila and nearby provinces,” DSWD Assistant Secretary for Community Engagement Uly Aguilar said in a statement on Wednesday, April 26.
AICS is a DSWD program that serves as a social safety net or a stop-gap mechanism to support the recovery of individuals and families from unexpected crises, such as illness or death of a family member, natural and man-made disasters, and other crisis situations.
Currently, there are two AICS processing areas—the DSWD Central Office in Batasan Road, which services the entire Quezon City and Northern Caloocan areas, and the DSWD Field Office-National Capital Region in Gastambide, Sampaloc, Manila, which serves clients from the cities of Manila, San Juan, Mandaluyong, and Makati.
The new satellite offices will cover the northern and southern parts of Metro Manila and will be operational on April 27.


Clients wait for their turn at the newly-renovated processing area for Step 1 of the Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation (AICS) at the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) Central Office in Batasan Road, Quezon City on Monday, April 24, 2023. (Photo by DSWD)
Meanwhile, the eastern satellite office will become operational at a later date.
The Camanava Satellite Office at the Victory Trade Plaza in Monumento, Caloocan City will facilitate the request for assistance of clients from the northern Metro Manila cities of Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas, and Valenzuela.
The Baclaran Satellite Office at the Victory Food Market beside Baclaran Church in Parañaque City will cater to the residents of the southern Metro Manila cities of Pasay, Parañaque, Muntinlupa, and Las Piñas.
In addition, the DSWD will also establish remote AICS processing areas in Pasig City and San Jose del Monte City, Bulacan next month.
The Pasig Satellite Office aims to deliver various forms of assistance under the AICS program, directly to clients residing in the eastern part of Metro Manila cities of Pasig, Marikina, Taguig, and the municipality of Pateros.
Residents from the municipalities of Norzagaray, Sta. Maria, Angat, and San Jose del Monte City in Bulacan will be served by the SJDM Satellite Office at the Starmall.
The satellite office in Bulacan will be operational by May 3.

412,PH scrambles to evacuate Filipinos in Sudan,Joseph Pedrajas,"Apr 26, 2023 ","The Philippine government is struggling to evacuate Filipinos from Sudan despite a 72-hour ceasefire declared by warring factions fighting in the streets of Khartoum, the capital city.
Ma. Teresita Daza, spokesperson of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), said Wednesday ""securing buses to transport Filipinos out of Khartoum has been challenging due to the scarcity of bus providers, increasing rental prices."" The evacuation buses will take Filipinos to Cairo, over 2,000 kilometers north of Khartoum.
""But seven buses have been contracted to transport the other Filipino evacuees. Efforts to secure more buses continue,"" she added.
As of April 25, 80 Filipinos already fled Sudan due to efforts provided by the Philippine Embassy in Egypt. There were 270 more who were still waiting for rescue, evacuation and repatriation.
There are 740 registered Filipinos in Sudan, DFA added.
Some Filipinos in Sudan are taking their fate into their own hands by fleeing the African nation by themselves amid fighting between its military and paramilitary forces that have so far killed hundreds.
Anthony Buhay and John Emil Deza, both Filipino workers in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, no longer waited for the assistance coming from the Philippine Embassy in Egypt, which has jurisdiction over Sudan, after renting buses just to take them out of the center of the clashes.
Buhay said he joined a group of evacuees, including Filipinos, who rented a bus for Egypt; while Deza travelled by a private car with his family bound for Soba, also in Sudan, to seek temporary refuge, while there was a 72-hour ceasefire declared by warring factions on April 24.
They made the move as the Philippine government struggled to evacuate them and the bullets started raining on the streets.
""Dito na po sa tapat namin nagbobombahan na po... Hirap na po, halo halo na pong stress. Walang pagkain, tubig. Lahat na po, wala (There were already bombardments in front of our house... It's really hard. All the stress. No food, no water. Everything's gone),"" Deza said in a recent interview with TV Patrol.
In a Facebook post on late Monday night, Deza said they are making their ""own efforts"" to leave Khartoum.
""Sa wakas makaalis na rin ng Sudan (We can finally leave Sudan),"" he added in a Facebook video he posted on Wednesday morning, which showed him with a group of other evacuees onboard a bus.
The French government also helped in the evacuation of foreign nationals, including Filipinos, according to its embassy in Manila.
""France stands in solidarity on the ground by answering the call of many European and allied partners who reported their nationals in Sudan,"" it said.
""The French Crisis and Support Centre (CDCS) contacted them to locate them and proceed as quickly as possible to their evacuation,"" it added.
Earlier, two Filipinos working for Saudi-based Saudia Airlines were among those evacuated by the Saudi government, according to DFA Undersecretary Eduardo Jose de Vega.
They were brought to Port Sudan before being brought by military ship to Saudi.
Meanwhile, Philippine Ambassador to Egypt Ezzedin Tago, along with Vice Consul Bojer Capati, figured in a car accident while on the way to the Egyptian border with Sudan for evacuation efforts of Filipinos there.
""Fortunately he was unharmed. He has returned to Cairo and will be flying to the border to facilitate the entry of  Filipino evacuees to Egypt,"" Daza said on Wednesday.
No Filipino has been reported killed due to the conflict that has already left hundreds dead. Meanwhile, one Filipino was reported wounded after being hit by a stray bullet.
Fighting erupted in Khartoum on April 15 due to power struggle between Sudan's military ruler, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and paramilitary leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. The clashes left at least 420 people dead, according to latest figure provided by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The DFA official said the Philippine post in Egypt already made its own representations with the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to facilitate thetemporary entry into Egypt of Filipino nationals.
The post is also exploring the deployment of assistance-to-nationals (ATN) teams to the Sudanese city of Wadi Halfa and to Port Sudan to provide consular assistance to evacuating nationals.
Daza said the embassy continues to monitor the developments in Sudan and to coordinate the evacuation and repatriation of Filipinos.
""It has issued a number of advisories on the situation as well as  on the evacuation/ repatriation efforts,"" she added.

413,"Court fight between Villar, BF homeowners association may go into its second round",Mario Casayuran,"Apr 26, 2023 ","The fight between Senator Cynthia A. Villar and the BF Resort Village Homeowners Association in Las Pinas City may go into its second round.
Villar said she would talk with her lawyer on filing a suit over several issues such as the construction by BFRV of a gate barring entry into her composting plant and removal of signages in the subdivision.
Villar’s complaints against the subdivision came to a boil after her ""fight"" with a BFRV security guard last April 17 went viral.
""Wala namang outburst (there was no outburst). It’s for public use it is not for me. Composting program has been there for 20 years. It was even given an international award,"" Villar, chairperson of the Senate agriculture and food committee, told Senate reporters in a press briefing.
""Eh ang laki-laki nya, alangan naman saktan ko sya (He is big, it is illogical for me to hurt him). There is something with It, he is a security guard he has a gun, Masasaktan ko ba yan, ang tapang ko naman, ang liit liit ko (Could I hurt him? Am I that brave? I am small,"" she said.
""I could not go into details because there is a pending case. What we got is TRO (temporary restraining order),"" she said.
She said she does not want people to remember her as a senator who just keep quiet.
""I fight for what is right and what is good for the people,""  she added.
""I have this to say. I filed a case before the RTC (Regional Trial Court) Las Pinas because of the prohibition of BFRV to accept our friendship sticker…it is against local legislation. I  filed a case, we were given a TRO (temporary restraining order) so the BF Resort Village can’t stop the people…dun sila nagalit sa akin (that’s why BFRV is mad at me). They are charging P2,500 per sticker, friendship sticker is free,"" she explained.
""I have encountered problems. Removing the signages that BF should honor the friendship sticker based on local legislation passed in 1995. Replaced the announcement in all five entrances four times already. Last time nakita na sila ang nagre-remove (The last time, they were the ones removing the announcement),"" she added.
""I was building an impounding facility for stray dog and cat they didn’t allow me,"" she added,
""They blocked the composting facility. When I removed the ISF (informal settler families)…they are fencing it. They don’t want me to build sidewalk in front of the composting facility. They park their truck in my sidewalks,"" she stressed.
Villar said BFRV also prohibited her from planting trees in that composting facility.
Asked if there is a malicious intent, Villar replied: ""Yes, but I don’t want to talk about it because we are going to court.""
""I was talking to them to remove the gate because the composting facility is for the public, they have plenty of security guards,’’ she stressed.
""Before ayaw nya papasukin ang aming truck may dalang ready mix para sa sidewalk tinawag ko chief of police (Before, they barred the entry of my truck with ready mixed cement for the sidewalk So I called the chief of police who allowed its entry into the subdivision),"" she added.
Asked if she has plans of leaving BFRV, Villar said ""no,"" adding that she has been a BFRV resident for the past 45 years.
The lady lawmaker said she has paid year membership dues, not for the month but for the full year.
According to Forbes, the Villar family is the richest in the Philippines,

414,SC asked to review dismissal of charges vs 2 dentists for ‘denying’ dental service to HIV-afflicted patient,Jeffrey Damicog,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Government lawyers have asked the Supreme Court (SC) to review the dismissal of the criminal charges against two dentists who allegedly denied dental services to a patient afflicted with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Sought for review in the separate petitions filed by the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) and the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) was the Feb. 9, 2023 resolution of the Court of Appeals (CA).
The CA resolution affirmed its 2022 decision that upheld the ruling of the Taguig City regional trial court (RTC) which dismissed the petition filed by the Office of the City Prosecutor (OCP) of Taguig.
The OCP assailed before the RTC the Taguig City metropolitan trial court’s ruling that granted the demurrer to evidence filed by the two dentists – Dr. Sarah Jane M. Mugar and Dr. Mylene Guevarra Igrubay – on the complaint lodged by Henry R. Se for violation of Section 40 of Republic Act No. 8504, the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Prevention and Control Act of 1998.
A demurrer to evidence is a motion that seeks dismissal of the criminal charges on allegations that the prosecution’s evidence is weak to sustain a conviction.  If granted, the dismissal of the charges is tantamount to an acquittal.
The petition stated that Se visited the Enhanced Dental Clinic (EDC) in Taguig City on Feb. 16, 2017 for consultation on the pain in his left molar tooth.
After disclosing that he is under medical treatment for HIV, Mugar advised Se to seek clearance from his physician before undergoing tooth extraction.
Se called EDC on Feb. 21, 2017 to set the schedule for the tooth extraction.  However, Mugar – on alleged instruction of Igrubay who is the owner of the clinic – “rejected Se's request for dental appointment because EDC purportedly does not have the ‘UV Type’ of desterilization equipment.”
In its petition filed in behalf of Se, the OSG told the SC that “the provision and standard of oral health care services for patients is the same regardless of the condition of the patient.”
“It is the primary duty of each dentist to deliver safe, effective and quality dental service and to practice universal precaution by treating every patient as if carrying an infectious disease,” it said.
For its part, PAO stressed the need to enforce RA 8504.  “In the Philippines, laws on anti-discrimination are already in place.  But unless the law is enforced and the State recognizes acts of discrimination, discrimination will never end,” PAO told the SC.
The OSG said that the CA committed grave abuse of discretion and misrepresented the facts “when it held that the prosecution failed to prove respondents' guilt beyond reasonable doubt.”
The CA decision, among other things, ruled that the failure of the EDC to render services to Se was “not ‘on account of actual, perceived or suspected HIV status,’ but the clinic's lack of the necessary desterilization equipment that the law mandates in the dental management of persons with HIV.”
But the OSG pointed out that during the litigation of the case “it is an established fact that EDC has ‘first class materials, sterilized dental instruments, and disposable dental supplies.’”
“That EDC had no UV sterilization equipment is belied by the very assertion of the clinic itself that it has ‘first class materials,’” the OSG said.
It also said that the inconsistency can only be explained by one conclusion – “that the lack of UV light sterilization was an excuse to deny service to Se, an obvious discriminatory act.”
Though there may be a lack UV sterilization equipment, the OSG said the prosecution presented as expert witness Dr. Anastacio Rosete Jr. who “testified that there could still be other means of sterilization used by the clinic.”
“At the time Dr. Mugar advised Henry Se to secure a clearance, it was apparent that the tooth extraction will proceed if and when Henry Se is able to comply with the required clearance. It is obvious that the refusal to perform the tooth extraction was contemplated upon and therefore a well thought of strategy to deny tooth extraction service to Henry Se,” PAO said.
“When he was required to secure a medical clearance, it was unequivocal that a tooth extraction can be performed by the clinic; only at that time, a clearance had to be obtained first.   That was the only condition and requirement for the tooth extraction to proceed. There was no pronouncement from Dr. Mugar regarding the sufficiency of their facilities on 16 February 2017,” it said.
Also citing the testimony of Rosete, PAO also said the two dentists “did not refer Henry Se to receive the needed dental service to another dental clinic, contrary to the Code of Ethics for Dentists, Dental Hygienist, and Dental Technologists.”

415,Solons slam PNP official's claim that Mayo could escape charges due to House probe,Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Congressmen took exception to the claim of Police Brigadier General Narciso Domingo that disgraced former police master sergeant Rodolfo Mayo Jr. could walk out of jail as a result of the House of Representatives' investigation on the Oct. 8, 2022 Manila drug bust.
Domingo, the former director of the Philippine National Police-Drug Enforcement Group (PDEG), made a presentation before the House Committee on Dangerous Drugs Wednesday, April 26 on the controversial police operation.
""I am afraid [that] tha biggest drug haul so far of the government now pending in court will be dismissed and one morning we will wake up looking at Sergeant Mayo going out of jail because of this proceedings,"" Domingo said.
This instantaneously drew a reaction from Antipolo City 2nd district Rep. Romeo Acop, himself a former police brigadier general.
""Mr. Chair, may I object to this statement of the general na bacause of this proceedings sergeant Mayo will go free? No! It is because of what you did. Not us. I take exception to that statement and let it be of record,"" Acop said.
Surigao del Norte 2nd district Rep. Robert Ace Barbers, chairman of the committee, echoed Acop's interjection.
""The observation of Cong Acop is noted. And let me reiterate that it is not this committee if and ever cases will be dismissed against perosnalities involved in this [confiscation of] 990 kilo of 'shabu'. It is not this committee [that] was instrumental in the dismissal of such case,"" Barbers said.
The dangerous drugs panel resumed on Wednesday its investigation in aid of legislation on the Manila drug operation. Mayo, who is one of the focal persons in the Manila drug bust where 990 kilos of shabu were seized, is an alleged ""ninja cop"".
Ninja cops are police officers involved in the illegal drug trade, particularly on the recycling or reselling of seized drugs from a police operation. Mayo, who attending the hearing via Zoom, is jailed at Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City.
Responding to Acop and Barbers, Domingo said: ""I am sorry your honors but my point is sergeant Mayo may use this proceeding in his defense in court and the court may subpoena this proceedings to prove that the timeline of events submitted to the court is different.""
During Wednesday's hearing, Col. Julian Olonan, PDEG Special Operations Unit (SOU) Region 4A chief, and Capt. Jonathan Sosongco, head of the PDEG SOU 4A team that supposedly arrested Mayo, gave varying timelines on the Oct. 8 operation.
But Acop underscored that all details pertaining to timelines came from the police, not the congressmen.
""Gusto ko lang sabihin kay Gen. Domingo na yung mga report niyo naman sa mga timelines e galing sa inyo e. Hindi naman nangggaling sa amin (I just want to tell Gen. Domingo that the report on timelines came from you. It doesn't come from us). So why put hte blame on us? Ang problema sa inyo (The problem with you is), you cannot take life,"" the Antipolo solon said.
""You must remember that when you are a commander, yung (the) phrase na command responsibility is automatically attached to you. All the things that your men will do or will not do, you are responsible. That is the essence of command responsibility.
""Kaya wag sumama ang loob mo. Kasama sa serbisyo ito (So don't gripe over it. This is all part of the service),"" explained Acop.
Acop finished his manifestation with some friendly advice for Domingo.
""Ikaw nga wala pang kaso sa korte. E, ako umabot na hanggang sa Korte Suprema. Pulis ako nung nakasuhan, congessman na ko nung na-dismiss sa Korte Suprema. So magtiis ka (You don't even have a case in court yet. But mine even reached the Supreme Court. I was a policeman when I was charged, and I was a congressman when the Supreme Court dismissed it. So you have to endure).""
The hearing is still ongoing as of this posting.

416,36 PNP senior officers to undergo further evaluation on drug links; 917 others cleared,Aaron Recuenco,"Apr 26, 2023 ","A total of 36 senior police officials will undergo another assessment and evaluation apparently after failing to convince the five-man screening committee that they are clean especially on the issue of illegal drugs.
The 36 third level officers, with the rank from full colonel to general, were among the 953 senior officers who submitted a courtesy resignation based on the request of Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos amid the continuous allegations of police involvement in illegal drugs activities.
Col. Jean Fajardo, spokesperson of the Philippine National Police (PNP), said a total of 917 senior officers have already been cleared by the five-man committee tasked to evaluate the integrity of senior officers.
Among the members of the five-man committee were Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong, former Defense secretary Gilbert Teodoro and former PNP chief Rodolfo Azurin, Jr.
“A total of 917 out of the 953 (PNP third level officers) were cleared so we will be awaiting the official release. It will depend on the prerogative of the President,” said Fajardo.
“But for the remaining 36, they will undergo further evaluation by the Napolcom (National Police Commission) and eventually once the findings will be submitted to the President, it will be the authority and discretion of the President as to whose resignation would be accepted,” she added.
The PNP did not disclose the names and the ranks of the 36 senior officers.
Based on the initial arrangement, those whose resignation would be accepted would be forced to retire.
The evaluation of all the third level officers is expected to be submitted to Napolcom this week.
And Fajardo said Napolcom has the authority to revise and amend the recommendation of the five-man committee.
“That is part of the authority and mandate ng Napolcom. Remember they exercise administrative control and operational supervision over the PNP and
based on the discussion, the Napolcom has the authority to revise or amend,” said Fajardo,
“So the ball is now on the Napolcom,” she added.
 
Earlier, Magalong said the result of their review would be a fresh start for the PNP in the campaign against illegal drugs and internal cleansing

417,DOH: No return of mandatory face mask policy in Metro Manila,Analou de Vera,"Apr 26, 2023 ","The Department of Health (DOH) denied a circulating report on social media that the mandatory wearing of face masks is once again being implemented in Metro Manila.
In an advisory, the DOH said that the circulating report claiming that “face mask should be worn at all times” in Metro Manila is “false.”
“The Department of Health (DOH) continues to remind the public to be mindful of the information we share and source information from reputable sources,” the DOH said on Wednesday, April 26.
“At present, Metro Manila is still under Alert Level 1, which means restrictions remain to be in status quo,” it added.
Based on the current policy, wearing of face masks in indoor and outdoor settings is voluntary except in healthcare facilities, medical transport vehicles, and public transportation.
This false report on social media circulated following the announcement of the latest resolution of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) on Alert Level, wherein 26 areas were under Alert Level 2, while Metro Manila is still under Alert Level 1.
Meanwhile, the DOH said local government units (LGUs) may implement health measures in their respective areas.
“Local government units have the jurisdiction to require certain health protocols in their communities through a local ordinance,” the DOH said.

418,"‘What will the weather do?’: PH multi-hazard impact forecasting, early warning system unveiled",Ellalyn De Vera-Ruiz,"Apr 26, 2023 ","The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) officially launched the five-year Multi-Hazard Impact-Based Forecasting and Early Warning System for the Philippines Project or the GCF-IBFPh Project on Wednesday, April 26.
The GCF-IBFPh, which is the country’s first Green Climate Fund project, has a total budget of US$22 million. The GCF Grant Proceeds amount to US$10 million and PAGASA’s co-financing (in-kind) amounts to US$12 million.

During the project launch at the Crowne Plaza Manila Galleria in Quezon City, PAGASA Deputy Administrator and GCF-IBFPh Project Leader Esperanza Cayanan explained that the project will address the urgent need for a more proactive and inclusive climate risk management in the Philippines, anchored on a people-centered multi-hazard impact-based forecasting and early warning systems for flood, landslide, severe wind, and storm surge.
It will catalyze a paradigm shift from traditional weather forecasts to multi-hazard impact-based forecasting and early warning system, she added.
Moreover, PAGASA Administrator Vicente Malano said the project is focused on the preventive aspects of disaster management by communicating to all stakeholders as to “what the weather will do” rather than “what the weather will be” thus enabling the public to take appropriate actions during the “window of anticipation” or “lead-time” before the hazard event occurs.
“There are many large-scale disasters that we all need to prepare for,” Science and Technology Secretary Renato Solidum said.
“By focusing on impacts, disaster management agencies, local government units, and the general public will have a better understanding of the risk, and will be more likely take appropriate actions because now you can imagine the disaster risk that will happen not only to your community but to your family and to you as an individual,” he pointed out.
The IBF-PH Project will be undertaken in the vulnerable barangays of Tuguegarao City, Cagayan; Legazpi City Albay; Palo, Leyte; and New Bataan, Davao de Oro.
It will run for five years, from 2022 to 2027.
PAGASA will be the lead executing agency, while the Land Bank of the Philippines will be the direct access entity.
Other implementing partners include the Department of the Interior and Local Government, Office of Civil Defense, Department of Environment and Natural Resources-Mines and Geosciences Bureau, United Nations World Food Programme, and the local government units in Region 2, Region 5, Region 8, and Region 11.
Other collaborators also include the National Economic and Development Authority, Department of Finance, Climate Change Commission, and Philippine Commision on Women.
“Overall, the efforts of these partner-collaborators would contribute to a paradigm shift from a traditional hazard-based to impact-based forecasting and early warning system, which combines the best available science and local knowledge on forecasting and risk assessment,” Malano said.
The major component of the project is the development of timely and actionable warning information to end-users, particularly at-risk communities, to reduce their exposure to climate risks and to strengthen their adaptive capacities to better manage and adjust to impacts brought about by extreme weather events.
PAGASA expects that in adopting an Impact-Based Forecasting Early Warning System, communicating risk effectively to the people most vulnerable to disasters is one of the desired changes during the project implementation.

419,Balikatan main event: What happened during the PH-US littoral live fire exercise?,Martin Sadongdong,"Apr 26, 2023 ","The highly anticipated combined joint littoral live fire exercise between the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the United States Armed Forces finally happened in San Antonio, Zambales on Wednesday, April 26, as part of the main event of the Exercise Balikatan 2023.
 


(President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. attends the combined joint littoral live fire exercise of Exercise Balikatan 2023 in San Antonio, Zambales on April 26, 2023. Photo by Noel Pabalate / MANILA BULLETIN)
The live fire exercise was highlighted by the sinking exercise (SINKEX) where 1,400 Filipino and American marines, soldiers, sailors, and airmen fired rockets, artilleries, and other weapons to sink the former BRP Pangasinan, a World War II-era corvette.
The drill was aimed at showcasing the interoperability of Filipino and American troops in conducting maritime and coastal defense operations.
 
“This training increased the exercise’s realism and complexity, a key priority shared between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the US military,” said Lt. Gen. William Jurney, commander of US Marine Corps Pacific and US director for the exercise.
This is what transpired during the main event of the 38th iteration of Balikatan which was witnessed by the Commander in Chief, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., along with acting Defense Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., AFP Chief Gen. Andres Centino, National Security Adviser Eduardo Año, Philippine Army Chief Lt. Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr., Philippine Navy Chief Vice Admiral Toribio Adaci Jr., and Philippine Air Force Chief Lt. Gen. Stephen Parreño among others.
SINKEX
The sinking exercise began around 9 a.m. when the US Armed Forces fired the first round of volley of its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which contained six rocket fires. HIMARS, an American rocket system, has been in service since 2010. It is currently being employed in the Ukrainian war and has seen service in the Afghanistan War, Syrian Civil War, and Iraq War.

The rocket fires were aimed at BRP Pangasinan, which was positioned at 12 nautical miles from the shoreline of San Antonio, near the West Philippine Sea (WPS). The former Philippine Navy corvette, which was decommissioned in 2021, represented an enemy force approaching the Philippine territory by sea.
The location of the ship was monitored by Hermes 900, a drone used for intelligence gathering, and other redundant sensors which transmitted the information to a combined intelligence fusion effects center (CIFEC) at Camp Aquino in Tarlac. The intelligence center provided a common operational picture of the entire area and coordination between the different firing units are processed in that particular location. The orders were also handed to the firing units through the CIFEC.
Simulating a real-world scenario where troops have to take out an adversary ship, the first rocket fire was aimed at the center mast of BRP Pangasinan to take away its communication systems while the remaining five shots were supposed to sink it.
However, the first shot missed the target since the vessel “is drifting so it was not in the correct location,” a US military personnel announced. The first shot was located at approximately six to nine meters away from the vessel while the five other shots hit different points.
Delay
A second set of HIMARS rockets were then prepared for firing as the CIFEC calculated the new position of BRP Pangasinan. But an aerial interloper was detected by the radars of the AFP and US Armed Forces which delayed the exercise for a few minutes.
(HIMARS rockets are fired during the combined joint littoral live fire exercise of Exercise Balikatan 2023 in San Antonio, Zambales on April 26, 2023. Photo by Noel Pabalate / MANILA BULLETIN)
“The range is cold because of safety issue, because of an aerial interloper that was reported to have entered the opera box [operational box]. We are waiting for the range to clear. The interloper was a private unregistered single craft aircraft in the middle of the ocean,” a US military personnel announced.
Prior to the exercise, picket vessels from the Philippine Navy and Philippine Coast Guard were deployed to secure the operational area. These vessels were to enforce the Notice to Mariners issued weeks before the Balikatan to prevent any commercial and local fishing vessel from passing through the operational area.
Once the interloper was escorted out of the operational area, the second volley of HIMARS rockets were fired and the exercise went smoothly.

It was followed by artillery fires from the Philippine Army’s Autonomous Truck Mounted Howitzer System (ATMOS), which are 155 mm self-propelled howitzers, as well as 105mm howitzers from the Philippine Marine Corps, and other US artilleries.
The artillery pieces were aimed at a much nearer secondary target called “killer tomato,” which are a bunch of drums tied with a bamboo, located 4.7 nautical miles away from San Antonio town’s shoreline.
After the artillery firing, the AFP and US Armed Forces utilized aerial assets in the capability demonstration exercise.
Among the assets used by both countries were Boeing AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, FA-50 Golden Eagle fighter attack aircraft, F-16 Fighting Falcons multirole fighter aircraft, F-35B Joint Strike Fighters aircraft, and AC-130 Spectre gunship.
“This significant activity demonstrated new potential and revitalized the strength of our militaries while we continuously forge an ironclad alliance,” said Maj Gen. Marvin Licudine, commander of AFP Education, Training, and Doctrine Command and Philippines exercise director for Balikatan.

421,"Prepare contingency plans during El Niño, Abalos urges LGUs",Chito Chavez,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Benjamin “Benhur” Abalos Jr. called on the local chief executives (LCE) nationwide to prepare and conduct mitigating measures to ease the impact of the El Niño phenomenon.
In Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2023-065, Abalos issued the same directive to the DILG Regional Offices, Bangsamoro Administrative Region for Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) Minister of the Interior and Local Government and other concerned parties.
“The purpose of the circular is to mitigate and prepare for the on-going and potential adverse effects of El nino in the country,’’ Abalos explained.
Abalos clarified that the MC is directed specifically to the provincial governors, city and municipal mayors down to the punong barangays, DILG Regional Offices and BARMM Minister.
He noted that the LGUs are urgently directed to enact ordinances in  curbing the illegal water connections and encourage the prudent use of water.
Among the water conservation measures mentioned by Abalos are the use of broom instead of hose in cleaning sidewalks and driveways, fixing leaky faucets, use of pail or bucket in cleaning vehicles, use of recycled or leftover water in house places, watering gardens during the coolest time of the day.
The DILG chief called on the LGUs to allow the water concessionaires/utilities to conduct repairs on leaky pipes prior to securing excavation permits, lift the application of number coding schemes as applicable with respect to water tankers that will be used by the water utilities to immediately address the water supply needs of the affected public.
Abalos also asked the LGUs and other stakeholders to implement and update the public on existing contingency plan related to the El Nino phenomenon, stockpile relief goods, food and non food items, for immediate relief assistance if the need arises, conduct massive information education and communications (IEC) campaign in the communities on the the monthly PAGASA Climate advisory, maximize rainwater harvesting and storage among others.
He bared that PAGSA raised the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Alert and Warning System to El Nino on March 24, 2023 based on the recent conditions and forecast models.
“When conditions are favorable for development of El Nino within the next six months and the probability is 55 percent or more, an El Nino Watch is issued,’’ Abalos explained.
Abalos disclosed that El Nino is the warm phase of ENSO which is characterized by the unusually warmer than average sea surface temperature (SSTs) in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific (CEEP).
With regards to forecast temperature, Abalos lamented that “warmer and humid weather conditions are expected in the coming months as the warm and dry season has started. .
Pertaining to the sectoral impact of El Nino, Abalos stated that the decline in soil moisture availability has an effect in the agricultural sector while there are reduced stream flows and groundwater due to less rainfall when it comes to water resources.
Abalos added that marine resources are affected with cases of fish kills and prevalence of red tide causing reduced fish production.
The DILG chief lamented that humans are also affected with health issues common during extreme hot weather.

422,"BIR forms task force vs traders using fake receipts, invoices",Jun Ramirez,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) Commissioner Romeo D. Lumagui,Jr. is launching an all-out campaign against businesses using counterfeit receipts.
The BIR chief has formed a task force, called Run After Fake Transactions (RAFT), to investigate and crack down on merchants across the country who are using fake invoices and receipts.
""This tax evasion tactic has been costing the government billions of pesos each year, while also legitimizing the sale of untaxed or smuggled goods.,"" said Lumagui.
He said the BIR has an initial list of buyers of fake sales documents.
The information, according to him, was obtained during a raid last year on a condominium unit in Quezon City's Eastwood area, where a large number of these illegal documents were seized.
The names of the buyers were found printed on receipts and invoice booklets.
Criminal charges have already been filed against the printers and accountant involved in the scheme, which will be handled by the Department of Justice.
According to Lumagui, RAFT is a task force directly attached to his office, and its focus will be on investigating buyers, sellers, and accountants who assist traders in committing tax fraud.

424,Risk assessment for Covid-19 subvariant Arcturus remains low—DOH,Analou de Vera,"Apr 26, 2023 ","The Department of Health (DOH)  allayed fears of the public amid the presence of Covid-19 subvariant XBB.1.16 in the country, saying that this coronavirus subvariant’s  risk assessment is still low.
The DOH made the statement following the detection of a lone case of XBB.1.16 in Western Visayas. This Covid-19 subvariant, also known as “Arcturus,” is a sublineage of the Covid-19 Omicron variant and is currently classified as “variant under monitoring” by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Arcturus has been detected in 33 countries or jurisdictions across six continents, the DOH stated in its latest biosurveillance report.
“Based on the latest risk assessment by the World Health Organization last April 17, 2023, no changes in severity have been reported in countries where XBB.1.16. are reported to be circulating,” the DOH said in a statement on Wednesday, April 26.
“There may have been slight increases in bed occupancy in India and Indonesia, but levels are still much lower compared to the effects of the previous variants. Overall, risk assessment is said to be low,” it added.
Initial evidence also suggests that there is not much difference between XBB.1.16 and the Omicron variant, the DOH said.
“Currently available evidence for XBB.1.16 does not suggest any differences in disease severity and/or clinical manifestations compared to the original Omicron variant,” the DOH said in its biosurveillance report.
The country’s first XBB.1.16 case already recovered from Covid-19, the DOH noted.
“The detected XBB.1.16 case in Iloilo Province was asymptomatic and has already recovered,” it said.
There are circulating reports online that symptoms of  XBB.1.16 subvariant include sore eyes. However, the WHO has yet to issue an official statement about this, the DOH said.
“At present, the World Health Organization has yet to confirm symptoms of the Omicron sublineage XBB.1.16 variant such as “sticky eyes” or conjunctivitis,” the DOH said.
“In general, Covid-19 exhibits flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, headache, body pain, and diarrhea – among others,” it added.
The DOH also noted that “aside from the known flu-like symptoms of Covid-19, other symptoms may vary from case to case and studies are continuously ongoing of what effects the virus may entail. What is important is that cases remain manageable.”
“For proper diagnosis of symptoms, consult with your physician or head to the nearest health facility,” it added.
Practicing the minimum health standards and getting vaccinated and boosted are still the best defense against Covid-19, the DOH reminded the public anew.
“The DOH would like to remind the public to continuously adhere to our layers of protection such as wearing masks, isolating when sick, and ensuring good airflow especially when mobile in public places,” it said.
“Most importantly, the public is advised to get vaccinated and boosted as vaccination remains to be the most effective and best long-term protection against the Covid-19 virus,” it added.

426,Palacio Del Gobernador employees GSIS members -- COA,Czarina Nicole Ong Ki,"Apr 26, 2023 ","The Commission on Audit (COA) has tasked the Palacio Del Gobernador Condominium Corporation (PDGCC) to transfer officially the membership of its employees from the Social Security System (SSS) to the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) to ensure payment of benefits and pensions.
In its audit report, COA found that employees of PDGCC -- a government owned and controlled corporation (GOCC) in Intramuros, Manila -- are still SSS members as of Dec. 31, 2022 despite being expressly excluded from SSS coverage under the Social Security Act of 2018. PDGCC employees have been mandated to adopt Republic Act No. 8291, the GSIS Act of 1997.
""Non-transfer of the employees' membership from SSS to GSIS is contrary to GSIS Memorandum Circular No. 036, s. 2022, which requires the mandatory GSIS membership coverage of personnel of non-chartered GOCCs, thus, the PDGCC employees are deprived of the appropriate benefits due them upon retirement,"" the COA explained.
The officials of the PDGCC have agreed to implement the transfer this year and already met up with the GSIS officers on Feb. 28 regarding the process and requirements of transfer of membership.
The GSIS officials explained that the PDGCC must decide whether to provide their employees with retroactive or prospective coverage, and these options should be presented to the Board of Directors for their comments and approval.
At the same time, the PDGCC was told to coordinate with the SSS to facilitate the transfer of membership to the GSIS.
""As an audit rejoinder, the Audit Team will monitor and evaluate the courses of actions taken and to be taken by the management to comply with the recommendations,"" the COA said.
PDGCC’s website states that it is a non-stock, non-profit corporation created under the Condominium Act (RA 4726) and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), formed exclusively for purpose of holding title to common areas of the Palacio del Gobernador Building.
It states that the corporation is being managed and controlled by a board of directors composed of senior officials from the three owners of the eight-storey building namely: Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) which owns the entire 2nd , 3rd , 4th 6th Floors and 1/4 of Ground Floor; Office of the President which owns the entire 7th , 8th Floors and 1/4 of Ground Floor; and the entire 5th floor which is owned by Intramuros Administration.
The PDGCC acting through its duly constituted Board of Directors is responsible for the administration and maintenance of the Palacio del Gobernador Building, the website also states.

427,Church assures Filipino repatriates from Sudan of support,Christina Hermoso,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Balanga Bishop Ruperto C. Santos has assured the Filipino repatriates from troubled Sudan of support from the Catholic Church.
“The Church is ready to work with the government to help Filipinos who will be repatriated from Sudan,” said the vice chairman of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines- Episcopal Commission for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People (ECMI) over Radio Veritas.
“The Church is always open to help and offer our resources to our fellow Filipinos. Our Church extends our collaboration and assistance for their needs,” said Bishop Santos, who is also the bishop-promoter of the Stella Maris-Philippines.

The prelate said the Church has programs in place to help the returning Filipinos.
“There are programs and plans in the dioceses to give hope, to heal and to help the Filipinos who have been repatriated,” he added.
The Department of Foreign Affairs said at least 156 Filipinos are ready to be repatriated amid the ongoing violence in Sudan that has left hundreds of people dead.
DFA Undersecretary Eduardo Jose de Vega said there could be up to 700 Filipinos in Sudan but only about 300 Filipinos have asked for repatriation.
Bishop Santos assured the Filipinos in Sudan of his prayers and holy masses.
“Through our chaplains, we are always praying and offering our Holy Masses for their safety, strength, and sound health,” he said.
Bishop Santos, earlier, called on Filipinos in the troubled African country to take the necessary precautions for their safety and to heed the advice of the Filipino government.

428,Ranking solon warns Pinoys vs complacency amid extension of SIM registration window,Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Filipinos shouldn't be complacent with President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.'s extension of the SIM registration period for another 90 days.
Thus, said House Committee on Appropriations Chairman and Ako Bicol Party-list Rep. Zaldy Co, who welcomed the move of the President.
""I requested and suggested only 60 days extension but the President did better by pushing the deadline back by 90 days,"" Co said in a statement Wednesday, April 26, which was the original deadline for SIM registration under Republic Act (RA) No.11934 or the SIM Registration Act.
""The 90 days leeway should not mean another excuse for SIM subscribers to wait until the last few days of the extension before they register. SIM subscribers must realize that their SIM phone numbers are means of identification and access to essential services as the country becomes more digital,"" Co said.
""Here at the House of Representatives, led by Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, one of our key concerns is 'disenfranchisement' of the poor and marginalized who have difficulty with SIM registration. We do not want them to be shut out of telco service because of their inherent problems stemming from being poor and marginalized,"" the Bicolano pointed out.
SIM stands for subscriber identity module. SIM cards are used to avail of network services on electronic devices such as mobile phones.
The SIM Registration Act originally set the enlistment window between Dec. 27, 2022 and April 26, 2023. The law provides for an extension of up to 120 days.
""Assistance must be given, especially to senior citizens who are unfamiliar with technical matters, persons with disability and persons with special needs who have inherent handicaps making them unable to follow online instructions, and solo parents and working parents who are hard-pressed to set aside hours to fall in line at service desks and kiosks,"" Co said.
He further noted that the extension gives the telcos (telecommunications companies) more time to work with the government agencies that have verifiable databases backing the IDs and identification documents they have issued.
The lack of IDs of some Filipinos has been cited as one of the reason for the low turnout so far in connection with the SIM registration.

429,Blended learning being implemented by some schools amid extreme heat --- DepEd,Merlina Hernando-Malipot,"Apr 26, 2023 ","The Department of Education (DepEd) on Wednesday, April 26, said that blended learning is already being implemented in some schools to address the concerns of learners, teachers, and parents regarding the conduct of in-person classes during the dry season.
“Some schools are already implemented blended learning,” DepEd Spokesman Michael Poa told the Manila Bulletin in a Viber message.
“Classes are held at certain times of the day when it’s not too hot but supplemented by ADMs [Alternative Delivery Modes],” he added.
On April 20, DepEd issued a reminder to schools that they are allowed to suspend classes and implement modular distance learning in consideration of the “well-being of the learners affected by extreme climate conditions as they attend in-person classes.”
READ:
https://mb.com.ph/2023/4/22/schools-may-suspend-classes-switch-to-distance-learning-during-extreme-climate-conditions-dep-ed
The agency also reiterated that the DepEd Order No. 037 s. of 2022 or the “Guidelines on the Cancellation or Suspension of Classes and Work in Schools in the Event of Natural Disasters, Power Outages/Power Interruptions, and Other Calamities,” provides for the implementation of modular distance learning “in the event of canceled or suspended classes due to natural disasters, calamities, and human-induced hazards to ensure learning continuity and that learning competencies and objectives are met.”
Asked how many schools have temporarily shifted to blended learning since the DepEd memo was issued, Poa said that field offices are “currently collating” the initial data.
Shortened class hours
Meanwhile, Poa reiterated that DepEd regional offices have already issued their respective advisories on matters related to the conduct of in-person classes during hot weather.
Last week, the Teachers’ Dignity Coalition (TDC) urged DepEd to consider shorter class hours or class days instead of implementing modular distance learning which is “not effective.”
READ:
https://mb.com.ph/2023/4/24/teachers-to-dep-ed-allow-shorter-class-hours-wearing-of-comfortable-clothes-amid-extreme-heat
“The pure modular has been proven ineffective, that's why we have learning gaps now,” said TDC National Chairperson Benjo Basas said in a mix of English and Filipino.
Instead of shifting to pure modular learning, TDC said that shorter periods of face-to-face classes would be more effective.
As a response, Poa noted that “simply shortening classes will also not be effective for learning, especially since we are on learning recovery right now.”
Long-term solution
To address the problem of extreme heat in schools, TDC said that DepEd should focus on long-term solutions.
For TDC, the long-term solutions include reducing the number of students per class to avoid overcrowding, building more classrooms, and hiring more teachers.
Basas noted that providing proper ventilation like installing enough electric fans or air conditioning systems in schools would also be crucial in addressing the problem.
Poa, in a Viber message to reporters on April 24, noted that while schools have Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE), this will not be enough to put up air conditioning systems in all classrooms.
“Kaya po mariin naming pinapaalalahan ang ating mga school heads na kung hindi na po conducive ang learning environment sa mga paaralan nang dahil sa init ng panahon maari po silang mag suspinde ng in-person at mag-implement ng ADMs (That's why we strongly remind our school heads that if the learning environment in schools is no longer conducive due to the heat of the weather, they can suspend in-person and implement ADMs),” Poa added.

430,Human rights lawyers fear for their safety,Jeffrey Damicog,"Apr 26, 2023 ","A group of human rights lawyers has expressed alarm over the safety of its members after they were allegedly “red-tagged” by the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) as “affiliated with communist terrorist groups (CTGs).”
The National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers (NUPL) had earlier condemned as “grave breaches” of international humanitarian law (IHL) the killings eight months ago of Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) leaders Benito Tiamzon and his wife, Wilma, and their unidentified companions.
The CPP had said that the Tiamzons were actually tortured before they were killed.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) had denounced CPP’s claim as it maintained that the Tiamzon couple and eight other rebels died when their motorboat exploded in the waters off Catbalogan City in Samar following an encounter with government troopers last year.
The NUPL, the legal counsel of the Tiamzons, had urged the government to fulfill its obligation to the IHL and hold the military to account not only for the deaths of the Tiamzon spouses but also of other similar casualties.
In a statement issued late Tuesday night, April 26, NUPL said:  “Instead of welcoming a legitimate call that seeks to uphold IHL or the law of armed conflict and settle once and for all these contrary accounts, it is regrettable that colleagues in the legal profession and co-officers of the court – coming from the top officer of the government's legal arm no less – would need to resort to hateful and gratuitous name-calling against fellow lawyers by casually labeling us as ‘CTG (communist terrorist group)-affiliated’ or ‘CPP NPA NDF front’ sans competent, credible and admissible evidence.”
“This has unfortunately endangered our lives and impeded the independent discharge of our professional duties, especially since we in NUPL are compelled to handle cases that most of our colleagues in the profession cannot, would not, or do not – for reasons we respect – handle,” it said.
“While we may differ in views, opinions and positions – just like we do in court – we should all endeavor to keep our professional dealings civil and fair, use only dignified language, avoid low blows, and refrain from promoting an unsafe environment in any setting, as we are mandated to do as lawyers under the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability and out of basic respect for our fellow human beings,” it also said.
At the same time, NUPL said that it is “a matter of fact that military sources took down their social media posts which reported the Tiamzon spouses as among the casualties of the said operation.”
“Hence, it was neither the NUPL nor many other concerned entities and individuals who were alarmed with the subsequent contrary report that the Tiamzon spouses and their companions were supposedly captured, tortured, murdered, and desecrated especially because there are abundant precedents and predictable patterns to support a reasonable basis to question the official military account,” it said.

431,Marcos witnesses PH-US joint live fire exercise,Argyll Cyrus Geducos,"Apr 26, 2023 ","President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. witnessed the Combined Joint Littoral Live Fire Exercise of the Philippines-United States of America (USA) armed forces in San Antonio, Zambales, on April 26.
The President was joined by US Ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson, Defense Senior Undersecretary Carlito Galvez Jr., and National Security Adviser (NSA) Eduardo Año, among others.
The activity highlighted this year’s Balikatan Exercise that kicked off last April 11 with over 17,600 participating Filipino and American military personnel.  — the 38th iteration of Balikatan and said to be the largest to date.
According to Malacañang, the event aimed to enhance their joint and combined capabilities in maritime security, amphibious operations, live-fire exercise, urban operations, aviation operations, and counterterrorism.
During the event, President Marcos observed the firing of a rocket launcher called the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) that can be used to hit distant targets.
The Combined Joint Littoral Live Fire Exercise also featured a sinking exercise with the Philippine Navy's (PN) BRP Pangasinan (PS-31), a World War II-era corvette decommissioned in 2021.

432,PH ports move up in World Bank's logistics index global ranking,Aaron Recuenco,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Philippine ports, and the way they are managed, have significantly improved based on the 2023 report of the World Bank that includes the speed of the movement of containers as one of the key performance indicators. 
From 60th place in 2007, the Philippines now ranked 43rd based on the 2023 World Bank Logistics Performance Index (LPI) which covers 139 countries around the world—the country’s highest ranking so far. 
The 2023 LPI survey was conducted from Sept. 6 to Nov. 5 last year and contains 4,090 country assessments by 652 logistics professionals in 115 countries in all World Bank regions.
Singapore topped the LPI survey but almost all countries included in the Top 10 are high-income economies in Europe that include Finland, Denmark, The Netherlands and Switzerland. 
In its report entitled Connecting to Compete 2023: Trade Logistics in the Global Economy, the World Bank presented the latest view on trade logistics performance wherein countries were rated in seven categories.
One of them is through the logistics performance index which focuses on a network of services that support the physical movement of goods, trade across borders, and commerce within borders. It comprises transportation, warehousing, brokerage, express delivery, terminal operations, and related data and information management.
Infrastructure, logistics competence and quality, timeliness and tracking and tracing score were also included as performance indicators. 
PH could do better
The latest report from the World Bank also indicated that supply chain disruptions and logistics performance may improve through time if changes will be accepted and implemented.   
“Trade logistics performance may have improved due to policy reforms and private sector capacity building over time, despite the constraints imposed by recent conditions. In other words, today’s performance should be higher than what it was five years ago, but the impact of the supply chain crisis may have prevented some of this development from showing up in the survey data,” stated in the report. 
The World Bank report also stressed the importance of a broader set of interventions covering policy and private sector development in getting or sustaining high logistics performance. 
“One important objective should be to better predict when goods will arrive at their destination, as with supply chain visibility tools that facilitate traceability,” the report read.
This is where the digital transformation in operations comes into play as the World Bank report also indicated that digitalizing the operations means decreasing the steps in the supply chain process: 
Meaning when the containers are not in motion, this contributes disproportionately to the supply chain lead time.
“On average across all potential routes, a container takes 44 days from entering the port of export to exiting the destination port, with a standard deviation of 10.5 days. Over 60 percent of this time is spent on ships, with the rest split between stays at ports of export, import, or transshipment,” the report read. 
In the case of the Philippines, there was already an existing intervention through the Trusted Operator Program Container Registry Monitoring System (TOP CRMS).
The implementation of the project, however, was suspended and the Department of Transportation (DOTr) is reportedly now planning for its cancellation. 
PPA priority 
The Philippine Ports Authority (PPA), which is under the DOTr, has been pushing for the implementation of the TOP-CRMS as a long-term solution to end decades-long problems on port congestion and the complaints of stakeholders on high logistics cost. 
TOP-CRMS uses technology for up-to-date container tracking allowing customers, carriers, freight forwarders, and shippers to access the status of their cargoes and containers. 
It is expected to keep a registry and monitor all inbound shipping containers that will track every foreign-owned container’s location and movement using the industry- accepted data interchange formats through encrypted channels.
The push for TOP-CRMS appeared to have been vindicated in the 2023 World Bank report which mentioned digitalization as one of the factors contributing to the growth of the emerging economies which is said to cut port delays by 17 percent. 
PPA General Manager Jay Santiago said the result of the World bank’s report shows that port digitalization is the way to go.
“It only proves that we need to be open in trying out new solutions to the current problems and it is about time to make the government processes more effective and transparent,” said Santiago.
“Hence the push of the state-run Philippine Ports Authority for continued digitalization plans as it hopes to hasten the flow of trade, speed up the process of transactions, and to lower the existing high costs.”
“Digitalization is our priority right now within the PPA to prevent the usual issues that people deal with in transacting at the ports. When it’s all done and everything is digital and online, we can reduce their waiting time and there would be no unwarranted challenges in their transactions. This is a big step in helping our economy rise from the pandemic,” he added.
PBBM’s digitalization push 
The PPA's TOP-CRMS uses technology for up-to-date container tracking allowing customers, carriers, freight forwarders, and shippers to access the status of their cargoes and containers. 
The program is in line with the directive of President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. to digitalize government processes and make them more effective and transparent for the end-users.
Santiago said the TOP-CRMS will streamline all the transactions at the ports in support of the Ease of Doing Business Law. 
“In fact, in a meeting with the Private Sector Advisory Council (PSAC) at Malacañan Palace, the President has favored the Digital infrastructure group of the TOP-CRMS program of PPA a chance to help lower commodity prices, prevent smuggling, and improve revenue collections,” said Santiago.
World Bank LPI explained 
The World Bank LPI is an interactive benchmarking tool created to help countries identify the challenges and opportunities they face in their performance on trade logistics and what they can do to improve their performance. 
The LPI is based on two components: First, a worldwide survey of international logistics operators on the ground (global freight forwarders and express carriers), providing feedback on the logistics “friendliness” of the countries with which they trade. 
The International LPI 2023 allows for comparisons across 139 countries. Second, this edition introduces indicators derived from global tracking datasets. They measure speed and delays for container, postal and air freight activities. 
They complement the main indicator but do not enter its score. Hence logistics performance is measured from two different perspectives: one based on the perceptions of international logistics professionals assessing their partner countries, the other one measuring the actual speed of global trade by using supply chain tracking information.

433,"Acorda attends House probe on Manila drug bust, says he won't tolerate erring cops",Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 26, 2023 ","Newly-minted Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief Major General Benjamin Acorda Jr. assured congressmen Wednesday morning, April 26 that his leadership won't tolerate erring cops.
""The PNP, especially under my leadership, does not and will not tolerate any wrongdoings, misconduct, and violation of laws of erring personnel,"" Acorda told the House Committee on Dangerous Drugs chaired by Surigao del Norte 2nd district Rep. Robert Ace Barbers.
""Thus, immediate conduct of impartial and thorough investigation will be conducted or had already been conducted against those personnel especially if they are involved in illegal drugs,"" Acorda added.
The Barbers panel on Wednesday resumed its investigation, in aid of legislation, on the controversial confiscation of 990 kilograms worth of ""shabu"" from a supposed drug bust in Tondo, Manila on Oct. 8, 2022.
Congressmen are suspecting that there is a cover-up on the incident as well as an attempt to recycle the large haul of seized drugs.
Acorda, who was named the new PNP chief only last Monday, said Special Investigation Task Group (SITG) 990 had already been formed to look into the issue.
""We are very much thankful and I brought with me the officers that are concerned, that were involved in the investigation,"" he told the committee.

Thus, said House Speaker Martin Romualdez, who arguably laid down the groundwork for such an important meeting the past couple of weeks.
“I think the conditions are right for the meeting between President Bongbong Marcos and President Joe Biden. We have high hopes for the exchange of ideas between the two leaders and its outcome,” Romualdez, Leyte's 1st district representative in Philippine Congress, said in a statement Wednesday, April 26.
Just days before Marcos’ visit to the United States (US), the Speaker embarked on a two-week trip stateside to meet with American lawmakers and discuss defense and security cooperation and economic partnership between the two long-time allied nations.
Marcos' meeting with Biden will be conducted in the backdrop of the Philippines' continued economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and heightened tension with China.
Romualdez is still in the US, following up on his earlier interactions with his US counterpart, Speaker Kevin McArthy, and other American lawmakers and officials.
The Speaker and his delegation also had meetings with US House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and Representatives Young Kim, Mike Rogers, Darrell Issa, Ami Bera, and Chris Stewart.
He has described his meeting with the Speaker of the US House of Representatives and other lawmakers as “historic and fruitful"". It was the first meeting between two House Speakers of the two countries in recent years.
“Our meeting proved fruitful as the Philippine delegation managed to impress on Speaker McCarthy the need for the legislative representatives of the two countries to ramp up discussions on how to further boost US-Philippine relations,” said Romualdez, who pundits have described as Marcos' top ally in Philippine legislature.
“Relations between our two countries remain strong. Our security alliance under the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty is ironclad. Our economic partnership is robust. And the friendship between our two peoples is solid,” the Speaker said.

435,Bong Go to subscribers: Consider the benefits of SIM registration,Hannah Torregoza,"Apr 26, 2023 "," 
Senator Christopher “Bong” Go has called on subscribers to avail of the mandatory subscriber identity module (SIM) registration for their own benefit and protection.
 
Go made the call as he expressed his support over the government’s decision to extend the deadline for mandatory SIM card registration in the country by 90 days.
 
The extension came in response to consumers’ appeal for more time to register their SIM cards, especially for those who were not prepared for the new requirement.
 
“Para sa mga kababayan nating hindi pa rehistrado ang kanilang SIM cards, samantalahin na ninyo ang palugit na ito upang hindi maputol ang mga serbisyong nakukuha gamit ang mobile phone (For our people who have not yet registered their SIM cards, take advantage of this extension so that the services obtained with the mobile phone are not interrupted),” said Go in an interview.
 
“Para din sa inyong proteksyun at ikabubuti ng lahat ang hangarin ng batas na ito (The purpose of this law is also for your protection and the good of all),” he stressed.
 
Go disclosed on Tuesday, April 25, that he recently appealed to the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) “to make such an extension to allow more users to register given that this is the first time we are making this mandatory.”
 
But it is also crucial to ensure that the registration process is simple and accessible to everyone, Go insisted. 
 
“Unang-una, dapat turuan natin ang ating mga kababayan at dapat gawing simple ‘yung pagrerehistro. ‘Yung pinaka-simple, (First of all, we must educate our countrymen and make registration simple. The most simple),” said Go.
 
“Importante dito, malaman sino ang owner, at dapat po hindi matigil ang serbisyo. Diyan na po magkakaletse-letse kapag naputol ang SIM, dahil hindi po makarehistro (It is important to know who the owner is, and the service must not be stopped. That's where things get messy when the SIM is cut off, because it can't be registered),” he added.
 
As of April 20, the government reported that approximately 45 percent of the 168 million subscribers across the country have completed the registration process for their SIM cards.
 
DICT Secretary Ivan Uy had said that one of the major problems that needs to be addressed is the difficulty some subscribers face when trying to obtain a valid identification card necessary for registration.

She recalled her stint as UN Security Council Summit President in 2005, “The last time it happened, I was president (of the Philippines) (and) we had a summit, so I presided over the heads of states who were in the Security Council. We had a resolution about terrorism that every country would have an anti-terrorism legislation.”

Francis Wee and her mother, Rosalind Wee who is the wife of the former Philippine Ambassador to Indonesia H.E.Leehiong Wee, accompanied Koharović during the call.

438,VP Duterte highlights value of sports in Filipino youth,Raymund Antonio,"Apr 25, 2023 ","Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte on Tuesday, April 25, turned the spotlight on the role of sports in teaching Filipino youth the discipline and hard work they need to succeed in life.
Speaking during the inauguration of Oriental Mindoro Sports Complex in Naujan, Oriental Mindoro, the official emphasized that sports could be the key in the growth and development of Filipino youth.
For her, sports and education are deeply connected in ensuring that children are protected from forces that hamper their pursuit of better lives and future.
“Winning becomes the fire that ignites their (children and youth) desire to win more games,” she said.
“But most importantly, sports teach them that winning is sweeter when it is celebrated with humility and when magnanimity becomes a source of inspiration for others to play future games better,” Duterte added.
She believed that those who get into sports learn “the value of discipline, hard work, and healthy competition.”
But more than winning, the Vice President also stressed the lessons learned from losing in competitions.
“In defeat, on the one hand, sports teaches them to harness their inner strength and maturity to persevere, work harder, and pick themselves up when they fall — and stand with a strong resolve to once again fight and fight to win,” she said.
She commended the local government of Oriental Mindoro for building the sports complex, which she described as a “symbol of the aspiration” of the local leaders for their children and youth.
“Magsisilbi itong simbolo ng pag-asa para sa ating mga kabataang may interest sa sports (This will serve as a symbol of hope for our youth who has interest in sports),” Duterte said.
However, this should also serve as a reminder for the officials that they need to push for the programs that would guide the youth toward a better future.
The sports complex features a multi-purpose hall, standard-sized track and field oval, tennis court, basketball court, and a volleyball court.
The inauguration of the sports complex was in time for the opening of the Oriental Mindoro Provincial Athletics Meet, where six teams have enlisted to compete in various fields.
Duterte extended monetary contributions to all six participating units, their coaches, and technical officials.

There is no need for the public to fear, said DOH Officer-in-Charge Maria Rosario Vergeire.
""Sa ngayon pa rin ang ating bansa mababa pa rin ang risk natin (Right now, our country is still at low risk),"" said Vergeire in a media forum.
Hindi po natin kailangan mangamba, kailangan lang aware tayo at vigilant tayo (We don't need to be afraid, we just need to be aware and vigilant),"" she added.
Vergeire said they are giving more weight on the country's hospital utilization, which is also still at low risk classification.
""Rest assured to all of our citizens, nakahanda po ang ating mga ospital, dumaan na po tayo sa ibat-ibang variant lalo na nung time nung Delta natututo na tayo (our hospitals are ready, we have gone through different variants, especially during the time of Delta and we have already learned),"" she said.
""Ang importante, ang ating mga ospital ay hindi napupuno at ang mga severe at critical hindi dumadami, ang mga namamatay din po ay hindi na dumadami. Tandaan kung paano niyo dapat proteksyunan ang inyong sarili para hindi na kumalat lalo ang sakit na ito (What is important is that our hospitals are not full and the severe and critical cases are not increasing as well as the number of deaths.. We must remember how we should protect ourselves so that this disease does not spread),"" she added.
There are several factors why the country's cases are increasing. This includes the presence of more transmissible variants of the Covid-19 virus and the increased mobility of the people, said Vergeire.
Vergeire said the government is ""trying to prevent or control"" the possible rise in cases and is hopeful not to impose strict restrictions just like in the past years ""because this is counterproductive.""
""We are trying to move away from that mindset na every time na tataas ang kaso kahit hindi naman significant ay tayo ay mag-iimpose ng mga restriction. Tayo ay unti-unting nagbubukas ng ating mga sektoe dahil gusto naman natin na umayos ang ating ekonomiya at mabawasan ang nagugutom sa ating bansa (that every time the case increases, even if it is not significant, we will impose restrictions. We are gradually opening up our sectors because we want our economy to bounce back and reduce the incidence of hunger  in our country),"" she said.
""Ang gusto natin, moving forward maintindihan ng ating kababayan, the virus is here to stay and itong pagtaas, pagbaba ng kaso, pagkakaroon ng kaso, ito ay talagang expected na natin dahil ang virus hindi mawawala (What we want, moving forward, is for our citizens to understand that the virus is here to stay and this increase and decrease in cases, presence of cases—these are really expected because the virus will not go away),"" she added.

444,Nograles tells new doctors: 'You must be accountable to the people',Dhel Nazario,"Apr 25, 2023 ","Civil Service Commission (CSC) Chairperson Karlo Nograles reminded new doctors that whether they choose a private or public practice, they must at all times, be accountable to the people.
Nograles made the statement as he congratulated the 1,573 new doctors who officially took their oath as Licensed Physicians on April 19, 2023, at the Philippine International Convention Center, Pasay City.
“Whether you choose to enter government or practice in private hospitals and institutions, as doctors, you are foremost, public servants, and you MUST at all times, be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency; act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives,” he stated.
In his keynote speech, Nograles gave three reminders to guide the newly-minted doctors in their new journey as healthcare professionals: first, that public service is a public trust; second is to strive to pay it forward by being a mentor to others; and lastly, to not compromise integrity as they live their dreams.
“Today’s oath-taking is not merely a ceremony to practice medicine; it is a solemn act and eternal promise to adhere closely to the ethical and professional values of the medical profession. As you begin your work as licensed physicians and realize your aspirations and your goals, may you always remember the reason for choosing this path, to safeguard the health of others,” said Nograles.
He cited Dr. Jose Jonas D. Del Rosario from the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) and Dr. Annie Claire Pekas from Luis Hora Memorial Regional Hospital (LHMRH), two doctors who were recognized and awarded by the CSC through its Honor Awards Program.
Doctors Del Rosario and Pekas were honored for their commitment to stay in public service despite the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nograles also acknowledged that being a doctor goes beyond the practice as a means of livelihood, as it is a vocation and a humanitarian calling to take the road less traveled to make a difference in the lives of the Filipino people.
The Oath-Taking and Induction Ceremony for New Physicians was attended by Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) Chairperson Charito A. Zamora; PRC Commissioners Jose Y. Cueto Jr. and Erwin M. Enad; Professional Regulatory Board of Medicine Chairperson Godofreda V. Dalmacion and members; Philippine Medical Association (PMA) President Maria Minerva Patawaran-Calimag; and deans of medical schools and colleges.

445,"No Facebook, no TikTok? DICT warns of harsh consequences for unregistered SIM card users",Betheena Unite,"Apr 25, 2023 ","In order to further encourage the public to register their SIM cards, the government is planning to cut them off from various services like calls, texts, and access to social media accounts if they would still fail to do so within the 90-day extension.
This, however, is not yet final and is still under discussion, Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Secretary Ivan John Uy said.
""So this is the last chance. The law actually has our hands tied. We are only allowed to do this, the extension once and up to a certain period of time. Thereafter, it will be a hard deadline,"" Uy said in a Palace briefing on Tuesday, April 25.
He reminded them that those who do not register will lose all services, numbers, access to their SIM card, which means they cannot call out, receive calls and cannot text. They will also lose access to their e-wallets and other financial services linked to their SIM card.
""So I urge the public really to register quickly,"" he said.
The DICT chief said they are exploring options in order to further urge the public to register their SIM cards promptly and not delay it.
""We are exploring some options that will be available to us in order to incentivize our public to register. We did not put those conditions in the first SIM card registration. But because of our observation that people are not taking our deadlines seriously, we are now exploring other options to incentivize registration,"" Uy said.
By ""incentivizing"", it means that users who fail to register their SIM cards within 90-day period might lose certain services even if the registration period is still ongoing.
""Let’s say, after the 60 days, you will lose your access to your Facebook accounts or to your TikTok accounts. But you still can use your phone – you can still call; you can still text, and then after a certain period, you will lose your outgoing calls so that way, ramdam ninyo kung anong effect na hindi kayo nagpaparehistro (you can feel the effect of not being able to register),"" Uy said.
""And so eventually, once we reach the 90-day, you will lose completely all services to all your SIM cards. So those are still being threshed out by the telcos as to which ones will be easier for them to implement and how do we schedule the gradual reduction of the services. So iyong mga matitigas ang ulo, they wanted some convincing whether we’re serious or not, makakatikim sila nitong mga incentives namin (they will have a taste of this in incentive),"" Uy explained.
Uy pointed out that the 90-day extension is a reasonable time for everybody to register.
He, however, expects that the government might be back to a hundred thousand or less for the next 30 days and would only start to peak up again when the deadline starts coming in.
""That's why we are exploring with the telcos with the possibility of incentivizing them by letting them taste what it would be like if certain services are no longer available to them if they do not register,"" Uy said.
""Whether you like it or not we are going to deactivate all the remaining sim cards after the 90 day period,"" he added.
President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. has approved the extension of the SIM card registration period after the April 26 deadline.
Marcos was compelled to extend the deadline due to the remaining 20 million unregistered SIM cards and low turnout in island provinces.

446,'Don’t heckle your classmates who can’t read; teach them' --- VP Duterte,Raymund Antonio,"Apr 25, 2023 ","Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte gave a piece of advice for school children who have classmates who are unable to read.
During her visit to the Tagumpay Elementary School in Pola, Oriental Mindoro, Duterte said young learners should teach non-readers in their class instead of heckling them.
“Dapat ‘yung mga hindi pa marunong magbasa, huwag nating awayin, huwag nating kantyawan, huwag nating pagtawanan. Dapat yung mga hindi pa marunong magbasa, dapat nating turuan. Kailangan natin tulungan (We should not tease those who can read and laugh at them. We should teach those who are unable to read. We have to help them),” she told the young learners.
The Vice President underscored the importance of promoting reading literacy among children for better communication and self-development.
During her interaction with them, she also encouraged the learners to hold on to their dream profession — motivating them to pursue their dreams through education.
The official urged them to have goals, so they have something that they’ll want to work hard for.
“Lahat ng pagsisikap natin sa loob ng classroom, papunta sya doon sa gusto nating gawin (All of our hardwork inside the classroom should be aimed toward what we want to do),” she said.
In her Facebook post, she cited a Department of Education (DepEd) report that said the schools are among those registered with high instances of absences because of the recent oil spill.
The oil spill was brought about by the sinking of MT Princess Empress, which carried 800,000 tons of industrial fuel oil, off the coast of Naujan town last Feb. 28.
While she was in the province, she also visited the Leandro Panganiban Sr.–Tagumpay High School, where she listened to the concerns and issues laid down by the school faculty through their principal.
Among the concerns and issues raised by High School Head Christopher Llave were the teachers’ challenges in skills development areas, campus internet connectivity, learning facilities, and the struggle of learners living far from the campus to attend daily classes.
Duterte responded that there were many factors beyond their control.
“Within our control is to innovate at gumawa ng paraan para makapagpatuloy sila sa pag-aaral (find ways for them to continue their studies),” the Vice President suggested.
So far, some 16 out of 400 learners already dropped out.
Meanwhile, the Office of the Vice President (OVP) also assisted the parents of students affected by the oil spill through a partnership with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD).
A total of 289 beneficiaries from four oil spill-affected barangays received P20,216 each.

447,DICT chief laments Pinoys ‘bad habit’ as SIM registration is extended,Raymund Antonio,"Apr 25, 2023 ","Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Secretary Ivan John Uy on Tuesday, April 25, denied that low turnout was the reason for the extension of the SIM registration as he lamented the “bad habit” of Filipinos when it comes to doing things “at the last minute.”
During a Palace briefing after his meeting with President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., the official said that “low turnout was not the main reason for extension” since there were already 82 million SIM registrations out of 168,016,400 total number of active SIMs in the Philippines.
“Clearly, matitigas lang talaga ang ulo ng ating mga kababayan (our fellowmen are just hard-headed). They were always hoping for extension,” Uy lamented.
“We should start being more responsible in complying. When we say deadline, it is really a deadline,” he added.
The DICT chief said this after reporting that there was a “surge in the registration” in the last two weeks before the original April 26 deadline.
According to Uy, there were only an average of 100,000 SIM card registrants during the first few months of the registration period.
“That goes to show the issue is not really limited ID or anything. It is just our bad habit of delaying to the last minute, the compliance (with) the law,” he stressed as the country’s major telcos claimed lack of valid IDs and digital literacy as obstacles to registration.
Meanwhile, Uy also bared plans to concentrate on provinces and islands with low registration turnout.
Among these island provinces, he noted, were Dinagat Islands, Camiguin, Siquijor, Tawi-Tawi, and Basilan.
The official said that residents of far-flung provinces should have no problem registering their SIMs because “our system is allowing even barangay-issued IDs so (the) barangay is already the lowest government agency” that is “fully accessible” to all residents.
“In the next 90 days, we will be concentrating on some of those islands and some of the communities where we will be deploying more people and more resources to those islands for registration,” he shared.
A day before the April 26 deadline, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla announced that the deadline has been extended by 90 days, giving active SIM users three more months to have their numbers registered.
Uy said there would be an estimated 15 to 18 million, or as much as 20 million, SIM cards that would be registered during the extension.
He expects total SIM registrations to be around 100 million since the remaining 50 million are disposable ones used for “different purposes,” such as telemarketing and scamming.

Cabato,"Apr 25, 2023 ","The Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA) and the National Commission on Space Activities (CONAE) of the Argentine Republic signed an agreement on Tuesday, April 25, on the peaceful use of outer space in celebration of the 75th year of diplomatic ties between the two countries.
The signed memorandum covers the following cooperation: ""Earth observation from space; use of satellite information for studies on the environment, natural resources, and emergency management; satellite systems development and their applications; ground infrastructure for space systems and their applications; space education and training; and space industry promotion.""
The creation of space projects, exchange of space-based information, mutual sharing of support for satellite missions, and exchange of scientists and technical personnel are also among the lined-up activities to be carried out under the partnership.
PhilSA said that the ceremony was a part of the 5th Philippines-Argentina Bilateral Consultation Mechanism held at the Diamond Hotel, Manila.
""Our cooperation agreement with Argentina marks another milestone in our efforts to expand and deepen our ties with other space-capable nations. Through the partnership with CONAE we open a new and exciting frontier in our countries' long and rich relations and additional opportunities for growing our local space ecosystems,"" said PhilSA Director General Joel Joseph S. Marciano, Jr.
The signing was witnessed by Claudio Javier Rozencwaig, undersecretary for foreign policy from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship of the Argentine Republic.
In addition, PhilSA also has existing collaborations with the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and the United Arab Emirates Space Agency.
""PhilSA also signed on to the Space for Climate Observatory, a global initiative to promote and facilitate the use of space technology for climate action led by the Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), the national space agency of France,"" the agency said.

450,"20-M unregistered SIM cards, low turnout in islands prompted PBBM to extend registration",Betheena Unite,"Apr 25, 2023 ","President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. was compelled to extend the SIM card registration period to 90 more days as he recognized that the remaining unregistered SIM cards are still a significant number.
Department of Information and Communications Technology Secretary Ivan John Uy said it was actually not the low turnout of registrants that prompted the President to approve the 90-day extension.
He said Marcos believes the remaining unregistered SIM cards, which are estimated to be around 20 million, are still a significant number that warrants an extension.
""Actually it's not the low turnout. We are already at 82 million and as I said earlier, the 168 million original number is not an accurate number in terms of legitimate SIM card users. The expected number would be about a hundred million more or less, maybe a 110 million on a hindsight. So with that number at 82 million, we are about 80 percent registered,"" Uy explained.
""So, when you're talking about 70 percent of all SIM cards issued being legitimate SIM card users, sa 168 million natin mga nasa (of 168 million there are only) 100 to 110 million, so we are expecting maybe about 20 million pa ang hindi nakapagrehistro (unregistered) and that's still a significant number. So the President has decided to allow the extension of 90 days,"" Uy added.
Another reason that prompted Marcos to extend the registration deadline is the data showing that most of the unregistered SIM cards were from far-flung areas and provincial islands.
""When the statistics came in, when we're looking at the low turnout, we discovered that some of the low turnouts were in the island provinces,"" Uy said.
""So with this when it was presented the President noticed that we need to put in more effort to deploy more teams to those island provinces in order to address the low turnout,"" he added.
The DICT chief said the daily registrants were only hitting about 100,000 to 200,000 per day but it went back up to one million registrants a day nearing to the supposed April 26 deadline.
With the 90-day extension, they are expecting that the remaining unregistered SIM cards pegged at 20 million will be registered as they will not hold back in deactivating all the remaining unregistered SIM cards after the 90 day period.

451,UNICEF: Over 1 million Filipino kids missed out routine immunization in 2021,Analou de Vera,"Apr 25, 2023 ","The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) expressed its concern as over one million children in the Philippines missed out their routine vaccine shots in 2021.
UNICEF estimates that globally, 67 million children ""missed out entirely or partially on routine immunization"" between 2019 and 2021. These are vaccines against polio, measles, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, among others, said UNICEF Philippines Immunization Specialist Dr. Carla Orozco in a media forum on Tuesday, April. 25.
In 2021 alone, at least 18 million children globally have not received a single dose of routine vaccines or the so-called “zero-dose children” and the Philippines ranked fifth globally with regards to this matter, said Orozco. “What are zero-dose children? These are children that have not received a single dose of vaccine by the time the child reaches one year old,” she said.
India registered the highest number of zero-dose children with 2,711,000 followed by Nigeria with 2,247,000; Indonesia with 1,150,000; Ethiopia with 1,134,000 and the Philippines with 1,048,000.
“In the East Asia and Pacific region where the Philippines belong, for 2021, Indonesia and Philippines are the major contributors to the high number of zero-dose children,” said Orozco.
The top five regions in the country with the most zero-dose children are Calabarzon (146,160), Central Luzon (99,541), Western Visayas (96,774), Bicol (80,905) and the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (75,671), UNICEF data showed.
""The alarming number may result in possible outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, disabilities, and even deaths of children,"" said Orozco.
""There was a measles risk assessment done by the WHO (World Health Organization) and DOH (Department of Health) as well with support from UNICEF, in the 2022 measles risk assessment has shown that the whole country is really ripe for an outbreak. That was last year, So, we really advocated---WHO, UNICEF, DOH to really implement immediately supplemental immunization activity or immunization campaign for measles,"" she added.
Orozco also noted that most of the zero-dose children live in marginalized communities or in communities considered ""vulnerable to outbreaks,” and often have no access to regular health services.
""Vaccine-preventable diseases affect children's physical and cognitive development and prevent them from becoming healthy, productive citizens,"" she said.
There are a lot of factors that contributed ""to this high number of zero-dose children or under-vaccinated children,"" said Orozco.
""Some LGUs would only have once a month vaccination sessions. And also, there is inadequate tracking of defaulters. Defaulters are those children that have not completed their immunization schedule but they have actually started it--and that is a usual scenario in the Philippines, they don't complete their vaccination schedule in time. There is lack of regular outreach immunization services, inadequate human resource,"" said Orozco.
Another is vaccine hesitancy.  ""Like religious beliefs, perceptions that vaccines are not important, misinformation--possible side effects, etc. These have contributed really to the low trust in vaccine's safety and efficacy,"" she said.
Covid-19 pandemic also disrupted the routine immunization services, said Orozco.
""Because of the urgent need to end the pandemic, the government and all sectors ---the priority, focus is really on the Covid-19 response, which overwhelmed the health system, especially human resources and funding as well. It affected the delivery of essential health services like immunization,"" she said.
Orozco said that the government should exert further efforts to address this problem.
""We know that the government is doing something of course but I think the government should do more. One, I think, the first step or major step is really on the human resources---to increase the number not only the number but also the capacity of human resources for health services,"" she said.
""Also, additional funds for the conduct of vaccination: that would include outreach immunization services, to track defaulters as well, and increase in vaccination services to improve immunization coverage,"" she added.
It is also important to conduct ""coaching"" or “mentoring” sessions for health workers. ""That would boost confidence and add on their knowledge and skills on vaccination,"" said Orozco.
In a separate press briefing on Tuesday, DOH Officer-in-Charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said the government will conduct a supplemental immunization activity starting May 2 to 31.
“Kailangan mabakunahan at mahanap natin ang mga kabataan na na-miss nga nating bakunahan (We need to vaccinate and find those children who we missed to vaccinate) during the times of the pandemic and even prior to that. And yung mga batang hindi pa kumpleto ang bakuna ay makumpleto na natin. Para maiwasan ang mga outbreaks na ating pwedeng mapigilan naman katulad ng polio at tigdas (And the children who have not yet completed their  vaccination. This is to  prevent possible outbreaks like polio and measles),” she said.

452,House panel invites these PNP members to join probe on Manila drug bust,Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 25, 2023 ","High-ranking Philippine National Police (PNP) officials are set to attend the House’s Committee on Dangerous Drugs' hearing Wednesday, April 26 on the controversial Oct. 8, 2022 drug bust in Tondo, Manila that had the fingerprints of alleged ""ninja cops"" all over it.
Surigao del Norte 2nd district Rep. Robert Ace Barbers, panel chairman, released on Tuesday, April 24 the list of PNP members invited to the hearing, which is a continuation of its probe on the Manila during incident.
They were Police Lt. Gen. Benjamin Santos Jr. who was then Deputy Chief PNP for Operations; Brig. Gen. Narciso Domingo, director of the PNP Drug Enforcement Group (PDEG); Col. Julian Olonan, chief of PNP Drug Enforcement Group (PDEG) Special Operations Unit (SOU) Region 4A; and Capt. Jonathan Sosongco, head of the PDEG SOU 4A arresting team.
Also invited were Lt. Col. Arnulfo Ibañez, officer in charge (OIC) of PDEG SOU National Capital Region (NCR); Maj. Michael Angelo Salmingo, deputy of PDEG SOU NCR; Lt. Col. Glenn Gonzales of Quezon City Police District; Lt. Ashrap Amerol, intelligence officer of PDEG Intelligence and Foreign Liaison Division; Lt. Col. Harry Lorenzo, Manila Police District Moriones Station Commander; and Captain Randolph Piñon, chief of PDEG SOU 4A Intelligence Section.
Most of these personalities were seen in the video footage captured at the crime scene--the WPD Lending office located along A. Bonifacio St., Tondo, Manila on Oct. 8, 2022.
Barbers said the other resource persons invited to the hearing were Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Benhur Abalos; Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Crispin Remulla; Maj. Gen. Benjamin Acorda, chief, Philippine National Police; Ret. P/Gen. Virgilio Lazo, head of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA); former PDEA chief Wilkins Villanueva; former PDEA NCR Director Alvin Alvarin; Commissioner Bienvenido Rubio of the Bureau of Customs (BOC), Admiral Artemio Abu, chief of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG); National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Director Medardo De Lemos; and former sergeant Rodolfo Mayo, Jr., owner of the WPD Lending office where the 990 kilos of shabu were seized.
Barbers said that since the incident, the public has not been apprised clearly on what had transpired in the PNP’s internal investigations on the drug bust, including the officers charged in court for their alleged attempts to recycle 42 kilos of shabu and the ensuing cover-up.
A ninja cop is a police officer involved in the illegal drug trade, particularly on the recycling or reselling of seized drugs from a police operation.
“As far as we know, only dismissed P/MSgt. Rodolfo Mayo Jr. had been charged in court. We have not heard or seen any details of his administrative and criminal cases. What about the other officers who we believe participated in the alleged double cover-up and double recycling attempts in said incident?” Barbers asked.
“And based on documents, police reports, video footages and TV interviews by police officers involved in the case, we have noticed irreconcilable inconsistencies on their narrative of the incident, particularly the narrative that Sgt. Mayo was arrested in a buy-bust operation at 9 p.m. of Oct. 8, 2022 for possession of two kilos of shabu,” he added.
Barbers said the ongoing PNP investigations on the case is also deafeningly silent on Mayo’s stockpile of more than 990 kilos of shabu.
“It is very important and very urgent for the police agency to find out the surrounding circumstances behind this particular drug recycling activity,"" he added.

453,BI nabs Japanese wanted for theft,Jun Ramirez,"Apr 25, 2023 ","Bureau of Immigration (BI) operatives have arrested a Japanese national wanted by authorities in Tokyo for alleged involvement in financial fraud.
Immigration Commissioner Norman Tansingco said  32-year old Sato Shohei was caught on April 24 in Pasay City by operatives from the BI’s fugitive search unit (FSU).
Tansingco said the arresting agents were armed with a warrant which he issued pursuant to a summary deportation order that the BI board of commissioners issued against Shohei last February.
“He was ordered deported after the Japanese government sought our assistance in locating and arresting him so he can be deported to his country to stand trial for his alleged crimes,” the BI chief said.
He added that Shohei was already placed in the immigration blacklist, thus he is perpetually banned from re-entering the country for being an undesirable alien.
BI-FSU chief Rendel Ryan Sy said a court in Tokyo issued an arrest warrant against him for theft.
Japanese authorities have reportedly alleged that Shohei conspired with several other accomplices in stealing money from the bank accounts of victims whose ATM cards they obtained by misrepresenting themselves as police officers, or financial service agency representatives.
The fugitive is currently detained at the BI warden facility in Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig City while awaiting deportation.

454,"Ople leaves for Egypt as repatriation in Sudan starts, assures affected OFWs of assistance",Aaron Recuenco,"Apr 25, 2023 ","The Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) has assured financial and livelihood assistance to over 325 overseas Filipinos Workers (OFWs) in Sudan who requested the government for repatriation over the ongoing clashes between the soldiers and paramilitary forces.
In a press briefing,  DMW Secretary Susan Ople said she will fly to Cairo, Egypt on Tuesday night, April 25, to oversee the repatriation of OFWs who feared of being caught in the crossfires in their host country.
“We are closely coordinating with the Department of Foreign Affairs for the identification of locations of cross-border assistance efforts,” adding that DMW teams will be stationed in the identified areas.
Over 700 OFWs have already contacted the nearest Philippine embassy and OPle said at least 325 of them have already requested for repatriation. 
She added that the number is expected to increase.
Clashing government forces and paramilitary forces have reportedly agreed for a three-day truce in a bid to give enough time for foreigners in the area to leave.
Ople said those who would be repatriated would receive US$200 as an immediate assistance while livelihood assistance would be offered to those who would agree to go home.
She then disclosed the DMW’s plan to coordinate with the officials of Saudi Arabia for temporary employment for those who would leave Sudan.
“The DMW has reached out to the Ministry of Human Resource and Social Development in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to discuss the possibility of temporary jobs for Filipino workers displaced by the ongoing conflict,” said Ople.
She said most of those who would be repatriated from Sudan are skilled workers who could fit into some job vacancies in Saudi Arabia.
Right now, Ople said the government's main objective is to put as many Filipinos in Sudan out of harm's way.

455,"Estrada: Telcos should make SIM registration user-friendly, fuss-free",Hannah Torregoza,"Apr 25, 2023 ","
 
Senator Jinggoy Ejercito Estrada on Tuesday, April 25 said telecommunication companies (telcos) should undertake the necessary steps to make the procedure for the registration of SIM (subscriber identity module) cards easier for prepaid subscribers. 
 
Estrada made the call after the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) announced a 90-day extension for the ongoing SIM registration. 
 
The senator said it is lamentable that only 49.31 percent of the 168 million subscribers have complied with the SIM Registration law. 
 
“We’re hoping that in the next 90 days, the 100% target registration will be met,” Estrada said.
 
Estrada said one of the biggest reason why a number of people are having a hard time complying with the requirements of the law is due to the process not being user-friendly for prepaid subscribers. 
 
Many also complain about the lack of internet connection or the inaccessibility of the registration sites which hampers registration.
 
“In the next 90 days, telcos should undertake the necessary actions to make the registration procedure fuss-free. No amount of information dissemination will work if the mobile network carriers will not address the concerns of the general public,” said Estrada, who is also a co-author and co-sponsor of the SIM Registration Act or Republic Act No. 11934. 
 
“Pundits will always have their say against this law but the majority will agree with me that the benefits of registered SIM outweigh the perceived threats or danger to people’s lives and public order,” he said.
 
“From the time RA 11934 was signed into law in October last year, the number of spam and scam text messages received daily by every mobile phone subscriber, myself included, reduced significantly or was almost nil,” the senator also noted.
 
Estrada reiterated that the purpose of enacting this law is to deter illegal acts aided by SMS technology and help law enforcers track down the perpetrators.
 
“Only the privacy of criminals will be compromised by the SIM registration law. Wala ng manghahangas na makapanloko sa text dahil mabibisto sila kapag rehistrado ang SIM (No one will dare to fraud through text messages, because they would be caught once their SIM are registered),” he stressed. 
 
Sen. Grace Poe, chairperson of the Senate Committee on Public Services, also welcomed the decision of the DICT to extend the period of SIM registration, which is supposed to end on April 26. 
 
Poe also said both the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) and the telcos should double the efforts to reach out to more subscribers in rural and remote areas to ensure that “no one is left behind.”
 
She also said a “lot more ground needs to be covered” as key areas such as the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) have yet to be reached according to the data by NTC.
 
﻿“It should be all hands on deck in expanding the reach of SIM Registration and in ensuring that no one gets left behind,” Poe said.

﻿“DICT, NTC, and telcos must also disseminate the correct information on the law and help clarify the confusion surrounding it. It should be emphasized that SIMs will still be available in local retailers and sari-sari stores even past the SIM Registration deadline. Users will simply be required to register first before they can activate their new SIMs,” she stressed.

456,"DA to comply with SC's order vs propagation of genetically modified rice, eggplant",Jel Santos,"Apr 25, 2023 ","The Department of Agriculture’s Bureau of Plant and Industry (BPI) said on Tuesday, April 25, that it will comply with the Supreme Court’s (SC’s) issuance of “Writ of Kalikasan” which temporarily halted the government from commercially propagating genetically modified (GM) rice and eggplant.
“We have not yet received a copy of the writ, but rest assured that BPI shall review and comply with the writ as necessary,” BPI Spokesperson Diego A. Roxas told the Manila Bulletin.
Meanwhile, he assured the public that genetically modified crops with biosafety permits from the BPI are safe.
“We also assure the general public on the safety of GM crops issued a biosafety permit by the BPI.”
During the SC’s full court session in Baguio City on April 18, the “Writ of Kalikasan” was issued by the high court.
Reports said the writ directed the secretaries of the Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and the Department of Health (DOH), the director of the Bureau of Plant Industry, the Philippine Rice Research Institute, and the University of the Philippines in Los Baños in Laguna to file a verified return within 10 days from notice.
The SC reportedly acted on the petition for a Writ of Kalikasan filed by several groups led by the Magsasaka at Siyentipiko Para sa Pag-Unlad ng Agrikultura (Masipag).
Various environmental groups have lauded the high court for issuing the “Writ of Kalikasan” against the release of GM crops.
For one, Greenpeace Southeast Asia said that the “decision is a win for farmers and Filipinos who have long opposed genetically-modified (GM) crops and the harm they bring to the people and the environment.”

457,PH starts evacuation of Filipinos in Sudan,Joseph Pedrajas,"Apr 25, 2023 ","The Philippine government has started the evacuation of Filipinos stranded in Sudan amid clashes between its military and paramilitary forces.
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) spokesperson Ma. Teresita Daza said that 50 Filipinos joined the first batch of individuals who were pulled out from Sudan on Friday at around 8 p.m. (Manila time).
This came after Sudan’s warring factions agreed to a three-day ceasefire to allow the evacuation of foreign nationals.
The rescued Filipinos will travel from the Sudanese capital of Khartoum to Aswan and Cairo in Egypt, according to Daza.
Meanwhile, in an interview with CNN Philippines, DFA Undersecretary Eduardo Jose de Vega said the Philippine Embassy in Egypt, which has jurisdiction over Sudan, will provide plane tickets to those who want to go back to the Philippines.
On Monday, de Vega already said three Filipinos who were working for Saudi-based Saudia Airlines were evacuated from Sudan by the Saudi government.
About 156 Filipinos were expected to leave Khartoum from the 740 individuals who registered for evacuation.

459,Expect surge in text scams following extension of SIM registration — DICT,Charie Mae F. Abarca,"Apr 25, 2023 ","Filipinos were told to brace for a possible uptick in mobile text scams and spams following the 90-day extension given to the mandatory SIM card registration.
In a public briefing on Tuesday afternoon, April 25, Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Secretary Ivan John Uy said the average number of text scams being received by Filipinos may increase.
“Unfortunately, with this announcement of a 90-day extension, we expect that text scams will increase again because we have given them a 90-day window to continue their activities. It was a pro and con thing and it was difficult for us to make this decision, but again we want the public to avail of the SIM card registration,” said Uy.
The principal goal of the law is to end mobile crimes, especially the proliferation of text scams and phishing.
“Ultimately, it is for our own good and to protect the public from all these criminal activities. I am just issuing this warning to the public: expect an increase in scams within this 90-day period because we’ve opened the floodgates again,” Uy furthered.
One of the factors behind the low registration turnout, according to Uy, is the “delayed compliance” of some Filipinos. More than 87 million cards have so far been registered nationwide.

460,Insurance firm commits to retrieve remaining oil inside sunken MT Princess Empress -- DOJ,Jeffrey Damicog,"Apr 25, 2023 ","An insurance firm pledged the retrieval of the remaining industrial oil in the MT Princess Empress that sank off the cost of Oriental Mindoro last Feb. 28.
Department of Justice (DOJ) Undersecretary Raul T. Vasquez said on Tuesday, April 25, that Valeriano Del Rosario and May Valles, representatives of Shipowners’ Protection and Indemnity Club (P&I), gave the commitment during the insurance firm’s first appearance in the inter-agency dialogue on the oil spill held last week.
“There is a big breakthrough. The P&I committed to do the retrieval operations, and the possibility of raising the vessel itself. But it’s up to their technical assessment whether or not that would be considered,” Vasquez said.
He said the pledge of commitment by P&I was timely since the United States and Japanese coast guards that brought their own remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) have already left the site where MT Princess Empress sank.
“We gave them (P&I) 10 days to give us the report and for them to tell us how soon they will do that,” he also said.
Vasquez said it was estimated that the vessel still contains about 300,000 liters of industrial oil from the 900,000 it initially carried when it sank last Feb. 28.
He said that International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds (IOPC) Director Gaute Sivertsten also attended the dialogue for the first time.
“The fact that the IOPC visited us and this showed their commitment to settle all claims because the IOPC is the one that handled the funds. Since the Philippines is a member state in that convention that created IOPC and the IOPC is the one handling the funding for all claims in respect to disaster,” he explained.
Meanwhile, Vasquez revealed that National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has “more or less completed the fact-finding data.”
“Under the case buildup rule that we have now under the DOJ, the findings will now have to be assessed by the National Prosecution Service before we would even initiate case whether criminal, civil or administrative against anyone, any entity, or the P&I, the shipowner,” he said.

461,DICT anticipates achieving 100M SIM registrants during 90-day extension,Charie Mae F. Abarca,"Apr 25, 2023 ","The mandatory SIM card registration, which was supposed to end on April 26, has been extended for 90 more days, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) confirmed on Tuesday, April 25.
DICT Secretary Ivan John Uy on Tuesday afternoon urged Filipinos to take advantage of this grant. Given this extension, the mandatory listing will now end on July 25, 2023.
“We believe that [the 90-day extension] will already give a lot of time to the public in order to fulfill the requirements of the law,” said Uy in a public briefing.
The DICT official then disclosed that there was a surge in registration in the last two weeks, averaging to more than a million registrations per day. This, according to Uy, proves that the problem of low registration turnout is not really limited to unavailability of identification cards and lack of access to the internet, but it is mostly because of “bad habits” of delaying compliance to the last minute.
To ramp up the registration processes, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), along with other government agencies, will continue mounting facilitated SIM registration sites, especially in geographically disadvantaged areas.
“This is our last chance. We are only allowed to do this extension once. Those who do not register will lose all services — their number, access to texts, calls, as well as e-wallets that are linked to their SIM cards,” Uy furthered.
The DICT said they are aiming to register at least 100 million active SIMs across the archipelago. Latest data from the NTC showed that 87,442,982 cards have been registered as of April 24. This is equivalent to about 52.04 percent of existing cards in the Philippines.
Signed into law in October 2022, the Republic Act No. 11934, also called the SIM Registration Act, seeks to eradicate electronic communication-aided crimes such as but not limited to text scams and phishing.
"
462,SC denies plea to stop SIM registration,Rey G. Panaligan,"Apr 25, 2023 ","The Supreme Court (SC) did not issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) which could have stopped the enforcement of Republic Act No. 11934 that mandates SIM (subscriber identity module) registration by all prepaid or postpaid holders.
Instead, the SC – during its full court session in Baguio City on Tuesday, April 25 -- ordered several government agencies and private telecommunications companies to answer the petition that challenged the constitutionality of RA 11934.
Also on April 25, President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. approved the extension for 90 days of the April 26 deadline for SIM registration.
The extension, which had earlier been announced by Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin C. Remulla, was the President’s response to the proposal of the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) for an extension of the SIM registration period.
As of April 23, 2023, more than 82 million SIMs have been registered or 49.31 percent of total active SIMs as of December 2022.  There are currently 168,016,400 active SIMs in the Philippines.
Government agencies ordered to answer the petition in 10 days from receipt of the SC resolution were the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), the National Privacy Commission, the DICT, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), and Department of Education (DepEd).
Also ordered to answer were Globe Telecom, Inc., Smart Communications, Inc., Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT), Dito Telecommunity Corporation, DIgitel Mobile Philippines, Inc., Sun Cellular and Cherry Mobile Communications, Inc.
The petitioners in the case were the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, journalist Ronalyn V. Olea, Lumad leader and former Bayan Muna Party List representative Eufemia C. Cullamat, BAYAN Secretary-General Renato Reyes Jr., Llorre Benedicto Pasco, Dean Matthias Razi Timtiman Alea, Maded Batara III of Junk SIM Registration Network, fisherfolk leader Alberto Roldan of PAMALAKAYA, peasant leader Danilo Hernandez Ramos of Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas, and lawyer Michael Christopher de Castro.
The petition invoked freedom of speech, rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, and privacy of communication in seeking to declare RA 11934 unconstitutional.
RA 11934 became a law on Oct. 10, 2022 and was enforced starting Oct. 28, 2022. The law mandates mobile device users to register their SIMs whether prepaid or postpaid.
The petitioners pleaded the SC to order public telecommunication entities (PTEs) to cease and desist from using, storing, transferring, and processing all information gathered into the SIM register and to destroy data already gathered.
They said that RA 11934 violates their right to freedom of speech by imposing a system of prior restraint; right against unreasonable searches and seizures and to privacy of communication by intruding into the petitioners’ reasonable expectation of privacy and circumventing the requirement of a judicial warrant; and substantive due process by intruding into the life, liberty, and property of petitioners.
“Given the nature of cell phones and devices connected to the internet, the SIM Registration Act partakes in the nature of prior restraint. On its face, the law chills all speech done through SIM if disclosure is not made,” they also said.
“By imposing a condition to speech expressed through the modern-day equivalent of the printing press, the SIM Registration Act imposes prior restraint,” they added.
They also told the SC that the deactivation of unregistered SIMs will affect the government dissemination of public service announcements and that ordinary citizens will not be able to capture, share, and discuss the misbehavior of their public servants, which is vital in a democratic country.
Also, they said that Filipinos with unregistered SIMS will be deprived of essential online services such as digital banking, online shopping, and transportation to courier services.
“Unregistered Filipinos will not be able to use internet services, websites, and social media platforms that require phone numbers as a mode of receiving one-time passwords (OTPs) to secure or recover user accounts,” they stressed.

The Task Force Balik Loob (TFBL) said that out of the number, a total of 10,637 of them were presented with “immediate, livelihood, and reintegration benefits” as well as “firearms remuneration” through the national government’s Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-CLIP) and Amnesty Program.
“Alternative solutions must be employed to resolve issues and concerns to sustain the assistance for the FRs that are packaged under the E-CLIP through a working-group level,” said Department of National Defense (DND) Undersecretary Angelito M. De Leon, chairperson of the TFBL, when he convened the member-agencies of the task force during its first quarter meeting at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City on Monday. The meeting coincided with the TFBL's fifth anniversary.
Those who were given the assistance only represent nearly one-third of the total number of FRs and FVEs who resurfaced since 2016.
To date, the immediate assistance granted to the FRs has amounted to P147.33 million, the TFBL said. 
The FRs and FVEs have also surrendered 6,148 firearms which translated to a remuneration of P151,079,811.49.
Meanwhile, livelihood assistance provided by TFBL partner agencies to FRs and FVEs already reached P322.85 million while the reintegration program bestowed to FRs and FVEs amounted to P164,563,200.
The TFBL was created by virtue of Administrative Order No. 10 in 2018 as a central coordinating body to supervise the government's reintegration efforts for members of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), New People’s Army (NPA), National Democratic Front (NDF) and their immediate family members.
The TFBL is composed of representatives from the DND, Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), Office of the Presidential Adviser on Peace, Reconciliation and Unity (OPAPRU), Office of the President (OP), National Housing Authority (NHA), as well as other partner government agencies.

Marcos disclosed on Tuesday, April 25, that Migrant Workers Secretary Susan Ople is now on her way to attempt to evacuate Filipinos in the country during the 72-hour ceasefire.
“Right now, we are hoping that the 72-hour ceasefire that has been declared will hold and we will — we are preparing ourselves,” Marcos said.
""We are preparing ourselves. In fact, Secretary Ople is on her way to the area para kung sakali man, matuloy yung sinasabing 72hours na ceasefire e makapag-take advantage tayo, mailabas natin ang mga tao natin (to take advantage of the 72-hour ceasefire to get our people),"" Marcos said.
They will, however, have to find ways to get into the areas where Filipinos are (staying) as airports and land routes ""are not completely safe.""
The President said the government is considering Saudi Arabia and Djibouti in East Africa as possible destinations although the original plan was to take Filipinos to Cairo, Egypt, despite this being a longer route.

“So we’re trying — we’re watching this situation very, very closely and to see if there’s a window of opportunity na mailabas natin ang mga Philippine nationals natin (to bring out Philippine nationals out),” he added.
The United States announced on Monday that the warring factions in Sudan had agreed to a 72-hour ceasefire starting at midnight on April 24.
US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the agreement between the Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF, and the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, came following intense negotiation.
The US, Blinken said, will coordinate with regional and international partners, and Sudanese civilian stakeholders to assist in the creation of a committee to oversee the negotiation, conclusion, and implementation of a permanent cessation of hostilities and humanitarian arrangements in Sudan.

465,House leader welcomes SIM registration period extension,Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 25, 2023 ","Camarines Sur 2nd district Rep. LRay Villafuerte hailed authorities on Tuesday, April 25 for heeding his to call to defer the deadline for SIM card registration under Republic Act (RA) No.11934 or the SIM Registration Act.
“We welcome this decision to extend the registration deadline by 90 days as this three-month grace period would give the DICT, NTC (National Telecommunications Commission) and PTEs (public telecommunications entities) time to further intensify their list-up drives,"" he said in a statement.
The extension, he said, will also allow government ""to fix hitches such as stringent identification requirements, weak or no connectivity and other digital challenges"" to the registration of SIM cards.
The original deadline for registration was April 26, 2023. As of April 23, the NTC website reported that 82.84 million or 49.31 percent of SIM card owners had signed up.
“While we recognize the government’s view that shady characters whose SIMs were the tools in their cybercrimes obviously have neither the desire nor intent to actually register their numbers used in scams and other nefarious activities, we must also consider the position of PTEs pushing a deadline extension that legit SIM owners need to be given more time to register their SIMs and avoid disenfranchisement,” said Villafuerte, majority leader of the powerful Commission on Appointments (CA).
“In separately appealing for an extension, the three PTEs—Smart, Globe and DITO—told the DICT and NTC that many legitimate SIM holders have possibly failed to register their SIMs over the four-month sign-up period because of their lack of the required ID (identification) cards for them to list up or because of digital challenges such as the poor connectivity or no Internet at all, especially in what the PTEs have called the ‘missionary’ or faraway places across the country,"" he said.
SIM stands for subscriber identity module. SIM cards are used to avail of network services on electronic devices such as mobile phones.
Villafuerte is one of the authors of RA No.11934, which set the SIM card registration window between Dec. 27, 2022 and April 26, 2023. The law, however, provides for an extension of up to 120 days.

466,"Balikatan main event: PH, US militaries to sink mock vessel in Zambales",Martin Sadongdong,"Apr 25, 2023 ","The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the United States Armed Forces will fire at and sink a decommissioned vessel of the Philippine Navy (PN) in Zambales on Wednesday, April 26, as part of the combined and joint littoral live fire exercise of the ongoing Balikatan drills.
(San Antonio, Zambales / Image courtesy of Google Earth)
The sinking of BRP Pangasinan (PS-31), a World War II-era corvette, is considered as the main event of the Balikatan and the live fire exercise. 
This year saw the largest iteration of the Balikatan exercise between the Philippines and America’s militaries with around 17,600 participating troops. The war games will conclude on April 28.
An advisory shared to the media by the Philippine Army (PA) showed that the combined joint littoral live fire exercise highlighted by the sinking of a mock vessel, a first for Balikatan, will take place at the Naval Station Leovigildo Gantioqui approximately 12 nautical miles (22 kms) off San Antonio town's coastal waters near the West Philippine Sea (WPS), which is well within the  country's territorial waters.
The BRP Pangasinan, which was decommissioned in 2021, will be treated as an adversarial vessel and targeted by navy ships to hone the interoperability of the AFP and US Armed Forces in neutralizing threats at sea, according to Col. Xerxes Trinidad, PA spokesperson.
""The combined and joint littoral live fire exercise in San Antonio, Zambales on 26 April 2023 is the main event of this year's iteration of Exercise Balikatan,"" Trinidad told the Manila Bulletin.
""Filipino and American soldiers, during the said exercise, will test their combined and joint tactics, techniques and procedures in the execution of coastal defense,"" he noted.
For the PA, a total of 234 personnel from the Armor Division, Artillery Regiment, and the Aviation Regiment will participate in the combined and joint live fire exercise.
The troops will also fire their High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), a rocket launcher mounted on a truck which can be used to hit distant targets with precision and power, during the drill.
The live fire exercise serves as an opportunity for the Filipino troops to learn how to operate the advanced weapons system which could be an integral part of the military's future arsenal, Trinidad emphasized.
""The said exercise reinforces the Philippine Army's thrust to gradually shift from internal security to territorial defense operations,"" he stated.
Air assault, live fire demo
Ahead of the Balikatan highlight, the AFP and US Armed Forces held a live fire demonstration using three American missile defense systems also in San Antonio, Zambales.
The live fire demonstration of the Patriot, Avenger, and Stinger was held at the Naval Education Training and Doctrine Command (NETDC) headquarters on Tuesday, April 25.
The Filipino troops witnessed the firing of the Patriot, a surface-to-air missile system; Avenger, which is a surface-to-air missile and gun weapon system; and Stinger, a man-portable air-defense system during the demonstration.

Meanwhile, PA soldiers and their counterparts from the US Army, US Marine Corps, and Australian Defence Force conducted Balikatan air assault operations in Pasuquin, Ilocos Norte on April 23.
Eighty-one soldiers from the PA’s 99th Infantry Battalion, 7th Infantry Division together with U.S. Army and Royal Australian Army soldiers conducted the air assault operations at the Paredes Air Station using a Black Hawk helicopter.
During an air assault operation, ground-based military forces hold vertical take-off and landing using an aircraft to seize and hold key terrain, and to directly engage enemy forces.
“Participating troops also conducted defensive operations in the area during the exercise,” Trinidad said.

467,Bill extending estate tax amnesty period hurdles House panel,Ellson Quismorio,"Apr 25, 2023 ","The House Committee on Ways and Means has approved with amendments the bill seeking to extend by another two years the availment of the estate tax amnesty, as provided for under Republic Act (RA) No.11213 or the ""Tax Amnesty Act"".
Chaired by Albay 2nd district Rep. Joey Salceda, the panel only took the entirety of its hearing Tuesday morning, April 25, to approve the measure, House Bill (HB) No.7409.
""This committee hereby directs the secretariat to prepare the substitute bill incorporating the amendments and style and the corresponding committee report and file the same with the Committee on Rules this week,"" Salceda said.
Just before the approval, Quirino lone district Rep. Midy Cua, a member of the committee, revealed the House's plan to pass the bill on second reading once plenary sessions resume on May 8.
""We were informed that the leadership is hoping that we can pass this on second reading in the first week of session this May,"" Cua said of the bill, which seeks to extend the availment period of the estate tax amnesty from June 15, 2023--which is just a few weeks away--to June 14, 2025.
The chamber's top leaders authored the measure. They are House Speaker and Leyte 1st district Rep. Martin Romualdez, Majority Leader and Zamboanga City 2nd district Rep. Mannix Dalipe, Senior Deputy Majority Leader and Ilocos Norte 1st district Rep. Sandro Marcos, Committee on Accounts Chairperson and Tingog Party-list Rep. Yedda Marie Romualdez, and Deputy Majority Leader and Tingog Party-list Rep. Jude Acidre.
The estate tax amnesty under RA No.11213 provides taxpayers the immunity from the payment of estate taxes as well as any increments and additions thereto, and civil, criminal, and administrative cases and penalties under the 1997 Tax Code.
The law, enacted on Feb. 14, 2019, covers the estates of decedents who died on or before Dec. 31, 2017, with or without assessments duly issued before, and whose estate taxes have remained unpaid or have accrued as of Dec. 31, 2017.
""However, the Covid-19 pandemic precipitated severe contractions in economic activity and caused job losses and closed businesses. Many of the taxpayers failed to comply with the requirements to avail of the tax amnesty due to limited movement and resources,"" read the explanatory note of HB No.7409.
""Thus, RA No.11213 was amended by RA No.11569 to provide an extension of the availment of the estate tax amnesty from June 15, 2021 to June 14, 2023,"" it noted. RA No.11569 was enacted during the previous 18th Congress.
Salceda says estate tax is a tax on the right of the deceased person to transmit the estate to lawful heirs and beneficiaries. ""RA No. 11213 was passed to provide taxpayers immunity from the payment of estate taxes until June 15, 2021,"" he noted.
A key amendment sought by panel member Nueva Ecija 3rd district Rep. Ralph Vergara further takes into account the ravages of the pandemic the past few years.
""Mr. Chair, I'd like to move that we extend the coverage from those who died before December 31, 2021 so that we can include those who passed away during the pandemic. Our laws should be practical and include the demands of an extraordinary time,"" Vergara said.
The deadly Covid-19 first emerged in the country in early 2020.
The Salceda panel, through a separate motion from Vergara, also sought to increase the exemption for the donor's tax from P250,000 to P1,000,000 ""with respect to Section 99 of the TRAIN (Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion) law"".
The ammendments are expected to be reflected in the committee report.
Elated with the inputs of his committee, Salceda said: ""What we thought is just another extension, but actually we're providing structural solution to one of the sources of tax inefficiency in our country, as well as of course...because we can never predict our own death, so we better allow people who are alive to make the resource allocation when they are still alive.""
""In other words, we give the people who are alive much of the decision that will affect our future,"" he said.
""Now that the extended deadline—June 14, 2023-- is upon us, we are informed that this tax amnesty is yet to be optimized. Families still struggle to comply with documentary as well as cash requirements. Hence, our leadership filed this measure to give more time to our constituents to clear their obligations,"" he further said.

468,Lawyer claims 2 Degamo employees ‘participated’ in plan to kill Negros Oriental governor,Jeffrey Damicog,"Apr 25, 2023 ","Two employees of slain Negros Oriental Gov. Roel R. Degamo have been tagged as “participants’ in the plan to murder the late governor.
Lawyer Levito Baligod, legal counsel of the Degamo family, said the two “insiders” in the killing were disclosed by a witness who also worked for Negros Oriental 3rd District Rep. Arnolfo “Arnie” A. Teves Jr.
Teves has been tagged as “mastermind” in the killings of Degamo and eight other persons in Pamplona town last March 4.  Teves, who is still abroad, has denied the allegations against him.
In an interview, Baligod said: “There is another one that I cannot divulge the name at this time siya po ‘yung nagdevelop ng mga informants na nagtatrabaho sa loob ng pamamahay ni Gov. Degamo (he was the one who developed the informants inside the house of Gov. Degamo).”
“And we have already identified the two employees who were even present during the final briefing on March 3, 2023,” he said.
Baligod said that prior to the March 4 killings, Marvin H. Miranda – tagged as “co-mastermind” and former bodyguard of Teves – conducted a briefing on the assassination.
He said that the investigators also found another witness whom Teves allegedly tried to recruit in the killing of Degamo.
“We have a witness who will testify that he was approached way back in 2016 to lead the assassination and he was aware of the most recent plan to implement it,” he also said.
Aside from Miranda, law enforcers have their custody 10 suspects in the March 4 killings.  Six of the suspects have been charged before the Manila regional trial court (RTC).
Earlier, the Department of Justice (DOJ) had said the cases against Miranda was ready for filing in court.
The complaints against the four other suspects will be resolved by the DOJ as they opted not to file their counter-affidavits.
Baligod said that so far, there has been no plan for any of the 10 suspects in custody to turn state witnesses.
“As it is the evidence is sufficient already to successfully prosecute all of them without any of them becoming a state witness,” he said.
The Manila regional trial court (RTC) has postponed the arraignment of the six suspects pending consolidation of the other cases against those who would be accused in the killings.

469,"Alibaba, Lazada convey excitement over PH market​​ as Arroyo visits China",Joseph Pedrajas,"Apr 25, 2023 ","Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and Lazada have expressed optimism about the Philippine market as former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo visited their headquarters during her recent trip to China.
According to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), Arroyo’s visit, particularly to Shanghai, signified the country's ""intensified"" interaction with business leaders in one of the global financial hubs.
The former president travelled to Shanghai and Hangzhou on April 1 and 2 to lead a group of Filipino youth as part of a larger itinerary in China on the invitation of the Beijing-based China Public Diplomacy Association (CPDA).
The Filipino youths were selected by the Association for Philippines-China Understanding (APCU), a Philippine NGO established in 1974 to promote people-to-people diplomacy and friendship with China.
""Both Alibaba and Lazada expressed excitement over the dynamism of the Philippines' e-commerce market,"" DFA said.
DFA said the highlight of their itinerary was a visit to Alibaba's headquarters, the ""Xixi campus,"" as Arroyo was greeted by its chairman, Zhang Yong, with Lazada chief executive officer James Dong.
""Chairman Zhang proudly cited Philippine products now 'unlocking the Chinese market' via Alibaba platforms, such as Sunflower crackers Sunnies Face cosmetics, and Kojie San skin lightening products,"" DFA added.
In 1977, Arroyo first visited Shanghai in an eye-opening sojourn just before Deng Xiaoping ushered in the transformative Reform and Opening Up policy that gave birth to China.
Her current trip was organized and designed around her 1977 itinerary, for the benefit of participating Filipino youths.

Government must move fast in transporting some 400 Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) out in conflict-ridden Sudan, Senator Francis Tolentino on Tuesday, April 25, said.
""The 400 plus OFWs should be evacuated to Egypt where we have an active diplomatic mission and where their safety can be assured,’’ Tolentino pointed out.
Tolentino strongly suggested that the government ""should hire buses at once to ensure their quick repatriation given the deteriorating condition in Sudan.""

Just follow the timetables in the law requiring the registration of Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards, Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III on Tuesday, April 25, said.
""Since extension is allowed, then ok,’’ Pimentel said following a national government announcement that it was extending the registration for 90 days.
The deadline as stated in law is April 26.
""Take advantage of the extension period to announce thru multi-media of the need for legitimate SIM card users to register. Then after the extension period, that’s it,"" Pimentel said.
""We should assume that those registered at the end of the long process are all those SIM cards which want to be used in a legitimate way,"" he added.
Pimentel, earlier, said there is no need to extend the deadline for registration as the main goal of the law is to find out which SIMS are active and which are not being used for serious or legal or important purposes.

472,Marcos approves SIM registration extension,Betheena Unite,"Apr 25, 2023 ","President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. has approved the extension of the subscriber identity module (SIM) card registration period after the April 26 deadline.
Shortly after Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla announced that the SIM registration had been extended for 90 more days, Malacañang also bared that the President approved the proposal on Tuesday, April 25.
""President Marcos Jr. approves the 90-day extension of SIM registration after the 26 April 2023 deadline,"" Malacañang said in a statement.
His approval came as a response to the proposal of the  Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) for an extension of the SIM registration period.
The approval was made during a sectoral meeting presided over by Marcos in Malacañang on Tuesday.

473,DICT targets 70% of active SIMs in 90-day extension,Raymund Antonio,"Apr 25, 2023 ","The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) aims to have 70 percent of active subscriber identity module (SIM) cards registered during the recently announced 90-day extension of the SIM registration period, the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) said on Tuesday, April 25.
“DICT is targeting to register 70 percent of active SIMs within the 90-day extension and reports to the President that more Filipinos will enjoy social, digital and financial inclusion upon SIM registration,” the PCO said in a statement.
Originally, the deadline for the SIM registration was on Wednesday, April 26, with the DICT reporting that “there has been a sharp increase in the number of daily registrants” in the days leading to the deadline.
But on Tuesday, April 25, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla announced that the deadline has been extended by 90 days, giving active SIM users three more months to have their numbers registered.
“To ramp up SIM registration, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) and other relevant government agencies have been conducting facilitated SIM registration in remote areas,” the statement read.
As of April 23, 2023, more than 82 million SIMs have been registered, representing 49.31 percent of total active SIMs as of December 2022.
Currently, there are 168,016,400 total number of active SIMs in the Philippines.
From the 82 million registered SIMs, more than 37 million are Globe subscribers, more than 39 million are Smart subscribers, and more than five million are Dito subscribers.
The SIM Registration Act mandates that all SIMs in the country be registered by Wednesday, April 26, to help eradicate SMS-linked scams.
However, the country's major telecommunication companies lamented the low registration turnout and have requested an extension.
They cited the lack of valid IDs and digital literacy as obstacles.

474,Hontiveros pushes for ‘true gender equality’ at Japan parliamentary meet,Hannah Torregoza,"Apr 25, 2023 "," 
Senator Risa Hontiveros has rallied parliamentarians to stand in solidarity with women’s movements across the world to ensure true and lasting gender equality.
 

Senator Risa Hontiveros with (left to right) Ma. Aurora Quilala, PLCPD Advocacy and Partnerships Manager; and Klaus Beck, UNFPA Deputy Regional Director. The senator is attending the Global Conference of Parliamentarians on Population and Development in Tokyo from April 24 to April 26.



Hontiveros made the call at the Global Conference of Parliamentarians on Population and Development in Tokyo, Japan, representing the Philippines, from April 24 to April 26.
 
“COVID-19 has taught us that we are more in need of each other than we would like to admit, more connected than we think, more similar than we are different,” said Hontiveros, who chairs the Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations, and Gender Equality,
 
“And I hope as we work towards creating societies that are freer, healthier, and happier for our women and girls, we always remember to work together, look out for each other, and stay united in our shared humanity,” the senator stressed. 
 
The event is organized by the Asian Population and Development Association, the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development Japan, the Parliamentarians Federation for Population, and supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, the United Nations Population Fund, and the Japan Trust Fund.
 
During the event, Hontiveros spoke about how COVID-19 has exposed the social inequalities that exacerbated the gaps and challenges facing women’s rights and gender equality in the Philippines.
 
""Our country was known to have the longest and strictest lockdown in the world, as the previous administration employed a militaristic method instead of a health-centric approach to our COVID-19 response. The consequences of this were most felt by the most vulnerable among us, especially our women and children,” the senator said in her speech.
 
On top of these, she said, were other forms of gender-based violence such as incidents of sex-for-pass at checkpoints to cases of online sexual exploitation of children on social media.
 
The online sexual exploitation of children, she pointed out, became prevalent in the Philippines, due to health and the economic crisis brought about by the pandemic.
 
Because of this, the Anti-Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children Law and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Law, were urgently passed in the middle of the pandemic in order to tackle the issues that most affect our women and girls, Hontiveros pointed out. 
 
The senator also highlighted the signing into law of the Safe Spaces Act in 2019, Republic Act No. 11313, or the “Bawal Bastos” law which covers all forms of gender-based sexual harassment done in public spaces, educational or training institutions, workplaces and online space.
 
At the same time, Hontiveros disclosed the filing of the bill on Gender Responsive and Inclusive Emergency Management Act, which seeks to address the gender-differentiated needs of women and girls as we are disproportionately affected in times of emergencies.
 
“We shouldn’t just stop at passing laws for our women, we should make it our responsibility to ensure that more women are also in leadership positions, more women who intimately know the lived experiences of being a woman,” Hontiveros said.
 
“When we have the different perspectives of different kinds of women in decision-making spaces and in all levels of governance, we would be more able to live out true gender equality and empowerment for all,” she added.

475,"Acorda commits to more funds, strong support system for cops on the ground",Aaron Recuenco,"Apr 25, 2023 ","Gen. Benjamin Acorda, Jr., newly-installed chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP), has committed to download more funds and other logistical support to police units on the ground as they are on the frontline of law enforcement operations.
As a former chief of police during his younger days, Acorda said he understands the concerns and other challenges being faced by lower police units in the conduct of operations and in maintaining peace and order in the communities they are assigned to protect.
“We will make sure that they are properly supported. I used to be a chief of police so I know what the feeling of being a chief of police is,” said Acorda.
“So that's what I wanted to ensure and I am asking for our DCA (Deputy Chief for Administration) to really supervise and make sure that the funds support, logistical support and other administrative requirements that the lower units need are properly given,” he added.
Over the years, lack of funds and other logistical issues have been the complaints of policemen on the ground—from lack of fuel for the conduct of beat patrol to lack of funds for the transportation and meals of policemen testifying in courts.
The problem, however, has been gradually addressed in the past years—and Acorda wants to download more.
Asked of his focus as the Chief PNP, Acorda said that their strategies will be in support of the Philippine Development Plan.
“We will support that through our administrative plan and operations. I will be making our DCA and DCO (Deputy Chief for Operations) very active in this,” said Acorda.
In his assumption speech, Acorda assured President Marcos that the PNP will be a main player in the economic development plan through peace and order.
“My uncompromising commitment to you Mr. President and to our fellow countrymen that we, under your administration, will be vanguards of peace to ensure a safe and economically stable community,” said Acorda in his speech.
“We shall be steadfast in providing better police service,” he added.

476,COA points out ‘losses’ of DBP’s leasing firm on foreclosed heavy equipment,Czarina Nicole Ong Ki,"Apr 25, 2023 ","The Commission on Audit (COA) said the Development Bank of the Philippines Leasing Corporation (DBPLC) suffered losses when three units of leased heavy equipment showed signs of damages and deterioration after they were kept in the premises of the defaulting lessee after voluntary surrender.
In its annual audit report, COA said that DBPLC leased three equipment -- Caterpillar Soil Compactor, Caterpillar Motor Grader, and Caterpillar Wheel Loader. The lessee defaulted in his lease amortization payments covering the years 2018 and 2019, he executed an Affidavit of Voluntary Surrender (AVS).
While the heavy equipment were voluntarily surrendered to the DBPLC, they were kept within the premises of the defaulting lessee in Barangay Malbayo, Morong, Bataan. Unfortunately, they were not properly safeguarded and even showed traces of physical damage, COA said.
Out of the three equipment, COA’s audit team found that the Motor Grader and Wheel Loader ""manifested signs of significant depreciation, arising from extensive utilization and operations.""
The Wheel Loader even had a broken glass window at the left side of the operator's seat, and the caretaker explained that it was because a galvanized iron sheet hit the glass window during the onslaught of Typhoon Paeng, COA said.
It also said that there were visible scratches on the Wheel Loader that was ""indicative of its actual utilization."" The ladder leading up to the driver's seat of the Motor Grader was also broken, it said.
""Considering the nature of the lease transaction and the repossession of the leased assets through voluntary surrender arrangement with the lessee, the leased assets are undoubtedly owned by DBPLC for which the right to use and dispose, including risk of loss and damages, accrue to the DBPLC,"" the COA said.
""Keeping the leased assets within the premises of the defaulted lessee for reasons such as the difficulty and cost involved in transporting the assets to another location, without periodic monitoring by DBPLC personnel on the fulfilment of the commitment by the lessee to provide physical safeguards such as protective covering over the leased assets, does not provide full protection on the interest of DBPLC,"" it said.
It recommended that the DBPLC coordinate and require to provide additional physical safeguards to protect the repossessed properties from theft and other events.
While the properties are kept within the lessee's premises, the COA said that the DBPLC should consider the issuance of a supplemental document signed by both properties specifying the prohibition on the use of the properties and imposing liability in case of unauthorized use.
The COA added that the DBPLC should revisit its Manual of Operating Procedures and include a detailed policy on safeguarding all repossessed assets for lease such as non-maritime assets in order to avoid similar incidents in the future.

477,Poe welcomes extension of SIM registration deadline,Mario Casayuran,"Apr 25, 2023 ","Senator Grace Poe on Tuesday, April 25, welcomed the decision of the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) to extend the period for registering Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards for 90 days.
The deadline for SIM card registration is tomorrow, April 26.
Poe, head of the Senate public services committee, explained that SIM Registration was meant to promote the responsible use of SIM and to halt the abuses of scammers and criminals.
""It is not meant to punish legitimate SIM subscribers especially those at remote areas,"" she said.
Poe recalled that during deliberations, lawmakers extensively considered the compliance of more than 168 million SIM subscribers, and have foreseen the need to incorporate an extension period to be able to accommodate all users.
As of 18 April 2023, only about 74 million or 44.15 percent of SIMs have been registered. DICT's extension will avoid disruption of critical mobile services.
Poe said telecommunications companies (telcos) must also mobilize and go down to the grassroots to reach out to more of their subscribers.
As most telcos have been enjoying vast profits from their services, they have the corresponding obligation and the necessary resources to track down their SIM users and to widen the opportunity for registration, she pointed out.
Poe stressed that both NTC and telcos must double their efforts in reaching out to subscribers in rural and remote areas.
While a number of locations have been visited for remote registration, a lot more ground needs to be covered as key areas such as BARMM have yet to be reached according to the data by NTC, she explained.
""It should be all hands on deck in expanding the reach of SIM Registration and in ensuring that no one gets left behind,"" she added,
Poe also said DICT should, likewise, look into the continuing proliferation of spam messages despite the ongoing SIM Registration.
Though with notable decrease in incidences, these scams and fraudulent messages still persist and victimize unsuspecting Filipinos, she pointed out.
The lady lawmaker said the Department must look into how these syndicates are able to hijack the system and compromise Philippine communications.
""DICT, NTC, and telcos must also disseminate the correct information on the law and help clarify the confusion surrounding it,"" she stressed.
""It should be emphasized that SIMs will still be available in local retailers and sari-sari stores even past the SIM Registration deadline,"" she said.
""Users will simply be required to register first before they can activate their new SIMs,"" she added.

Undersecretary Ariel Nepomuceno, executive director of NDRRMC, led an inter-agency meeting at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City on Monday, April 24, as he emphasized the need for the harmonization of interventions of concerned government agencies for the climate phenomenon.
“We need to prepare for the possible worst case scenario and identify and harmonize short term solutions, medium term, and long term solutions,"" said Nepomuceno, who is also the Administrator of the Office of Civil Defense (OCD).
El Niño is a phenomenon which increases the likelihood of below-normal rainfall conditions which could bring negative impacts such as dry spells and droughts. 
According to Nepomuceno, the proposed El Niño team will be led by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).  
Meanwhile, its members will be composed of the OCD, Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Health (DOH), Department of Science and Technology (DOST), National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), National Irrigation Administration (NIA), and Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS).

A support team will also be established comprising the Presidential Communications Office (PCO), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), National Water Resources Board (NWRB), and Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).
“This team will address the impacts of El Niño in our food security so that means it will monitor our food production so we won’t have shortage. Its impacts should be minimal to the public,” NDRRMC Spokesperson Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV said in a radio interview with dzMM on Tuesday, April 25.
“We will also be looking at our water security because we often have reduced supply of water during El Niño. This also affects our energy security since we are likely to have a reduced supply of energy,” he continued.
“Of course, our health team is also on alert because there are many diseases that might spread due to El Niño. We also have to consider public safety because the threat of fire is there due to intense heat as well as forest fire,” he added.
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) reported during the interagency meeting that the El Niño phenomenon can be felt as early as June to August 2023 with chances of increasing severity towards the first quarter of 2024.
Based on its El Niño forecast, Pagasa said that various areas may start experiencing below normal rainfall conditions including Abra, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga, Metro Manila, Apayao, Mountain Province, Ilocos Sur, La Union, Spratly Islands, Batanes, Cagayan, Isabela, Quirino, Nueva Ecija, Occidental Mindoro, Oriental Mindoro, Pampanga, Tarlac, Zambales, Laguna, Rizal, Quezon, Spratly Islands, Albay, and Guimaras. 
Meanwhile, the provinces of Ilocos Norte, Bataan and Cavite are already experiencing way below normal rainfall conditions.
The creation of the El Niño team was decided after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. met with officials of various government agencies last April 18 to direct necessary preparations through a whole-of-government and whole-of-nation approach in addressing the drought.
Marcos, during the meeting, also called for strengthening the public campaigns on water and energy conservation.

479,SIM registration extended for 90 days – Sec Remulla,Jeffrey Damicog,"Apr 25, 2023 ","The government extended for 90 days the April 26 deadline on the  registration of subscriber identity module (SIM).
The extension was announced by Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin C. Remulla who attended a Cabinet Cluster meeting at Malacanang on Tuesday, April 25.
SIM registration is provided for under Republic Act no. 11934, the SIM Registration Act.
RA 11934 provides that public telecommunications entities (PTEs) should set up their respective registration platforms to onboard users who present valid identification cards.
Data from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) showed that as of April 23, only 82,845,397 SIMs have been registered.  Registered SIMs represent 49.31 percent of more than 168 million holders all over the country.
SIM holders were originally given until April 26 to register or face the risk of deactivation.
""Most of the services that come with the cellphones that are not registered will be cut off with the telcos,"" Remulla said.
""So, there will be a social media unavailability for those who do not register,"" he said.
The SIM Registration Act took effect last December.  The law was signed by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. last October.
Earlier, Remulla had warned telecommunication companies not to take advantage of the deadline for SIM registration.
“Our eyes will be on the telcos not to take undue advantage of this. Maraming yang consequences. May mga disappearing load na naman ‘yan. Merong pera na naman sa GCash (There are many consequences. There could be disappearance of loads. There could be disappearance of money in GCash),” he cited.

480,"Gatchalian urges DFA, DMW to expedite repatriation of Filipinos in Sudan  ​",Hannah Torregoza,"Apr 25, 2023 "," 
 
Senator Sherwin Gatchalian on Tuesday, April 25 called on the Departments of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Migrant Workers (DMW) to exert all efforts in repatriating all Filipinos trapped in Sudan amid the heightened hostilities in the African nation.
 
At the same time, the senator urged distressed Filipinos in Sudan to get in touch with the Philippine embassy in Cairo, Egypt for their immediate repatriation. 
 
Gatchalian also urged Filipinos based in the Philippines who have immediate relatives and loved ones in Sudan to convince their respective family members in the war-torn country to seek assistance from the embassy. 
 
Earlier, the DFA said that there are around 400 Filipinos recorded in Sudan.
 
“The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Migrant Workers should exert all efforts in locating Filipinos in Sudan and ensure their safety and wellbeing as they await the Philippine government in bringing them home,” Gatchalian said in a statement.
 
The lawmaker made the call after the DFA issued an advisory saying the agency will begin repatriation efforts and is asking Filipinos in Sudan to establish contact with the Philippine Embassy in Cairo so that they can be included in the list.
 
Reportedly, more than 500 Filipinos in Sudan have sent messages to DFA officials seeking government’s help for their repatriation. 
 
Though all airports in Sudan have shut down, the senator said one option Filipinos can do is through land travel from Khartoum to Cairo, where they can fly from Cairo to Manila. 
 
Based on his estimates, Gatchalian said repatriating 400 Filipinos would cost the government P34-million to P46-million. 
 
He also noted that a land travel to Cairo also entails an additional budgetary cost of about P23-million for a 2-day subsistence allowance for the repatriates. 
 
The senator said the DFA has a P1.259-billion budget allocation under the 2023 General Appropriations Act (GAA) intended for the “protection and promotion of welfare of overseas Filipinos.” 
 
At the same time, the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), an attached agency of the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW), also has a repatriation budget which is sourced from employers’ contributions, the lawmaker pointed out.
 
As of end-2021, Gatchalian said the value of the OWWA fund was at P1.40-billion.

""The official receipt should be enough. Huwag na natin dagdagan ang gastos at mag-print pa ng temporary driver's license na naka-print sa papel lang (Let’s not add to our expenses by printing temporary driver's license that would only be made out of paper),"" Lee said in a statement Tuesday, April 25.
The LTO said the plastic card shortage was the result of a department order they received in January, which stated that all procurements involving P50 million and above should be conducted by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) central office.
It also said that its inventory of plastic card licenses would completely run out by the last week of this month.
The LTO had announced that it will be extending the validity of driver's licenses that are expiring soon, after it faced backlash over the weekend over news of the shortage.
For his part, Lee underscored the need for government agencies not to waste resources.
""Hindi unli ang pera ng pamahalaan (Our government doesn't have unli-funds). Temporary licenses are a wasteful and unnecessary response to the problem. Masasayang lang ang milyun-milyong papel, ink, kuryente at effort sa pag-print ng mga ito (We will only be wasting millions worth of paper, ink, electricity, and effort in printing these),"" the lawmaker said.
""This is a call not only for the LTO, but for all card-issuing agencies as well. Kung kaya naman nang patunayan ng official receipt, huwag na tayo gumawa ng temporary card (If an official receipt can suffice, then there's no need to produce a temporary card),"" the neophyte solon said.

In her speech, she also stressed the importance of guiding children to the right path and never let them succumb to drugs and violent extremism.
The official also took time to introduce her PagbaBAGo campaign, which was first implemented when she was still mayor of Davao City.
The campaign, which advocates education as a way to end poverty, comes hand-in-hand with family planning, Duterte said.
“Dala namin sa PagbaBAGo campaign ang importance ng responsible parenthood o pagpaplano ng pamilya dahil karamihan sa mga naghihirap na pamilya maraming anak dahil wala silang access sa kaalaman sa tamang pagpaplano ng pamilya (Through the PagbaBAGo campaign, we bring the importance of responsible parenthood or family planning because many of the impoverished families have many children because they don’t have access to the knowledge of family planning),” she added.
Meanwhile, Duterte also graced the Pasalamat Festival in La Carlota City in Negros Occidental, where she reiterated her earlier message about the importance of education as key to better life opportunities.
She reiterated the goal of the creation of the Department of Education’s (DepEd) MATATAG agenda which will hone young children to be patriotic and serve the country.
“Sa taong ito, inilunsad ng Department of Education ang MATATAG agenda na naka-angkla sa Basic Education Development Plan 2030 (In this year, the Department of Education launched the MATATAG agenda that is founded on the Basic Education Development Plan 2030),” she said.
“Ang MATATAG agenda ay ang ating tugon sa agarang pangangailangang ihanda ang ating kabataang Pilipino na maging matatag, may kakayahang matuto, at umangkop bilang mga magiging pinuno at manggagawa ng bansa (The MATATAG agenda is our answer to the immediate need to ready our Filipino youth to be strong, have the ability to learn, and adapt as future leaders and workers of the country),” the Vice President added.

490,Pimentel to DOLE: Protect workers from extreme heat,Mario Casayuran,"Apr 24, 2023 ","The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) should issue a directive to protect workers from the extreme summer heat, Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III said on Monday, April 24.
Pimentel said the DOLE should order the automatic suspension of work outdoors or indoors when there is a Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Atmospheric Services Administration (PAGASA) announcement on very high temperature levels.
He cited the case of construction workers and street sweepers whose work should be suspended during the searing heat.
The Senate chief fiscalizer said DOLE should make it clear that workers should get paid when their work is suspended because of very high temperatures.
Pimentel pointed out that work suspensions would not have a great effect on their work or on the economy because this would not be done everyday.

491,VP Duterte’s office opens 8th satellite office in Isabela,Raymund Antonio,"Apr 24, 2023 ","The Office of the Vice President (OVP) has a new satellite office; this time, in Cauayan City, Isabela.
This was the eighth satellite office formally opened by Vice President Sara Duterte’s office to bring medical assistance and social services closer to Filipinos in need.
The newly launched Isabela satellite office was located at the A.V. Building, Gov. F.N. Dy Boulevard, in San Fermin, according to the OVP.
Apart from Cauayan, the OVP has already established regional satellite offices in the cities of Dagupan, Cebu, Tacloban, Bacolod, Zamboanga, Davao,  and Tandag in Surigao del Sur.
These offices are open to the public during office hours from Monday to Friday.
Duterte’s office said it hoped to “further expand its reach in terms of providing quality and efficient services to indigents” nationwide.
Among its other programs include Medical and Burial (MAB) Assistance, PagbaBAGo Campaign, Libreng Sakay, Mag Negosyo Ta ‘Day, and Peace 911.
On April 18, the OVP also opened a Public Assistance Division Extension Office in Lipa, Batangas to expand its MAB support for needy Filipinos in the Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon) region.
Duterte’s office reported that its Public Assistance Division has already processed a total of P398,940,819.56 for the medical and burial assistance program as of April 18.
There were 42,670 recipients who were served through the OVP Central Office and the seven satellite offices around the country, it added.
The OVP also has a total of 343 partners composed of public and private hospitals, and dialysis centers nationwide.

492,"Use confidential funds to buy electric fans for public schools, Pimentel tells DepEd",Mario Casayuran,"Apr 24, 2023 ","Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III on Monday, April 24, suggested the distribution of electric fans at public schools to protect learners from the extreme summer heat being experienced in the archipelago.
Pimentel opted for electric fans because air-conditioning units are expensive.
For the purchase of electric fans, Pimentel said Department of Education (DepEd) could use their P150-million confidential funds embedded in the 2023 budget and even funds to address the Covid-19 pandemic.
Pimentel had questioned and wanted to reduce the P150-million confidential fund for DepEd but this was kept in the budget because majority of the senators and congressmen voted for it.
The Senate chief fiscalizer explained that there is no need for Congress to pass a measure to realign the confidential and pandemic funds, and its disbursement could be done on orders of DepEd authorities.
In a related development, Pimentel said learners should not go to school or they should be dismissed early when the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) says the heat of the sun is at dangerous levels and that there should be make-up classes.
He said school authorities should also consider the return of a school calendar where the summer vacation is during the months of April and May, and ensure that school buildings to be constructed in the future are well-ventilated.

493,Magnitude 5.1 quake jolts Agusan del Norte — Phivolcs,Ellalyn De Vera-Ruiz,"Apr 24, 2023 ","A 5.1-magnitude earthquake struck Agusan del Norte around 5:32 p.m., Monday, April 24, said the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs).
Phivolcs said the quake originated at a depth of 1 kilometer and had its epicenter around 4 kilometers northwest of Santiago, Agusan del Norte.


It was initially measured as a 5.5-magnitude earthquake, but Phivolcs later revised it to magnitude 5.1.
Phivolcs said the quake was felt at Intensity IV (moderately strong) inSantiago, Jabonga, Magallanes, Buenavista, Remedios T. Romualdez, Cabadbaran City and Butuan City in Agusan del Norte; Intensity III (weak) in Carmen and Nasipit in Agusan del Norte; and Intensity II (slightly felt) in Surigao City, Surigao del Norte.
It pointed out that the earthquake was tectonic, which means it was caused by the movement of an active fault near the area.
Phivolcs said the earthquake may not have caused damage to houses, buildings, and other infrastructure, but advised the public to remain vigilant as aftershocks may occur.

494,Pioneer study on treatment for 'rugby boys and girls' in progress — UP,Luisa K. Cabato,"Apr 24, 2023 ","Scientists from the University of the Philippines (UP) are conducting a ""first-of-its-kind multidisciplinary study"" on the chemical, physical, and psychological effects of ""rugby"" on those who abuse its intended use.
The study, called Novel Approaches to Treatment of Addiction and Depression using Animal Models, is a three-year research program headed by the UP Manila National Institutes of Health, the National Center for Mental Health, the UP College of Medicine, the UP Philippine General Hospital, and the UP Diliman College of Science Institute of Chemistry.
It is being supervised by internationally-renowned neurobehavioral scientist Dr. Gregory Quirk of the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine.
Quirk developed a research program on the neural mechanisms of fear regulation, which is being used as a treatment for anxiety disorders.
""The first-ever model of its kind for toluene-based solvent addiction in the Philippines, this research is paving the way for new treatments for overcoming withdrawal and craving. The team hopes to translate their findings for use in human subjects as an attempt in addressing the pervasive drug addiction and chronic relapse in individuals. Such experimental treatments for toluene have not been deeply investigated anywhere else in the world, because inhalant abuse is not as rampant in more developed countries,"" UP said.
""Attempts to treat toluene or ‘rugby’ addiction have been largely unsuccessful due to severe withdrawal and craving symptoms that trigger relapse. What is needed to help adolescents overcome their addictions are new treatments that reduce toluene withdrawal and craving,"" said program leader Dr. Rohani Cena-Navarro.
Rodent models have been used in developing treatments for other addictive drugs, but no model has been developed for toluene—an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent found in easily-obtainable contact cement, popularly known under the ""rugby"" brand name in hardware, Navarro noted.
""This collaboration between scientists and clinicians hopes to address this societal problem using laboratory animals,"" she added.
Where did ""rugby boys and girls"" come from?
In a statement, UP emphasized that children and adolescents from the country's highly populated and poorest areas have no choice but to turn to substance abuse to ease their hunger.
This led to physiological addiction which then pushed them to beg, scavenge, or steal not just to satisfy their hunger but also to sustain their toluene addiction.
""Seeing groups of young boys—and girls!—running around the streets sniffing bags of glue has become so commonplace to the ordinary Filipino citizen, that the colloquial term 'rugby boys' is now a widely-used pejorative,"" UP said.
This substance abuse among children is a long-standing issue that needs proper public health intervention, and acknowledging the need for local research regarding the growing issue will be very significant in providing proper attention and treatment to the victims.
""In the years to come, it is our hope that the establishment of this Addiction Research Program will further open opportunities for research addressing the craving and withdrawal stages of addiction,"" said Dr. Grace Gregorio who is conducting research on the effects of toluene to rats with the hopes of understanding its effects in people.
Research progress
Currently in the second year, UP stated that it has already completed the first two phases: identifying validated methods to quantify toluene in rodent blood and establishing the long-term effects of toluene after chronic exposure.
""Using validated methods, the team is investigating the effects of chronic exposure that last long after the drug has been stopped. These include increased craving for the drug, increased anxiety, and impaired social functioning, all of which increase the likelihood of relapse following treatment. Novel treatments will be tested to diminish these withdrawal symptoms and restore the brain to its pre-addiction state,"" it said.
Aside from that, the study is also trying to address the challenge that researchers face when it comes to ""interweaving science into the fabric of a complex, busy, and highly diverse society.""

495,Finally! DPWH moves to relocate electric posts in the middle of widened roads,Manila Bulletin,"Apr 24, 2023 ","The electric posts, which render some of the government’s road-widening projects practically useless, will soon be relocated to where they are supposed to be.
This, after the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) has committed to come up with guidelines on validation and prioritization of payment on the relocation of electric poles that are within road right-of-way (ROW).
DPWH Undersecretary for Legal Affairs Anne Sharlyne G. Lapuz said they are now also preparing a detailed master list of the electric posts that must be relocated in the soonest possible time.
 
She said the DPWH Legal Service and Regional Offices Right-of-Way and Legal Division (ROWALD) nationwide agreed to take proactive steps and give serious attention to the relocation of obstructing electric poles which is a common issue especially in ongoing and newly-widened roads across the country.
“By the end of our meeting, we have agreed to formulate a standard procedure in the actual and physical validation of electric poles located within the government's right of way,” said Lapuz.
“We will also prepare a detailed master list and the transitory guidelines in the prioritization of payment and relocation of electric poles considering we are working with a P50 million budget in 2023,” she added.
Lapuz said she also ordered a close coordination of DPWH with the National Electrification Administration (NEA) on the proposed courses of action. (Nicole Magmanlac)

497,CSC issues rule on authority to dismiss 'defective' administrative cases,Dhel Nazario,"Apr 24, 2023 ","The Civil Service Commission (CSC) has released a resolution designating the Assistant Commissioner for Legal to issue orders dismissing administrative cases found to be defective based on technical grounds.
In a statement, CSC said that complaints and appeals which are non-compliant with the technical requirements of the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RACCS) may be dismissed by the Civil Service Commission’s (CSC) Assistant Commissioner for Legal.
The CSC released Resolution No. 2300030, promulgated on 13 January 2023, which designates the Assistant Commissioner for Legal to issue orders dismissing administrative cases found to be defective based on technical grounds provided in the 2017 RACCS, or the rules of procedure for handling disciplinary and non-disciplinary administrative cases lodged in the CSC.
CSC said that the rule is in response to the increasing number of complaints and appeals found to be defective and dismissible due to the failure of concerned parties to observe and strictly comply with the requirements. This would allow the Commission to focus on resolving cases based on their merits, thus streamlining the process and leading to the speedier disposition of administrative cases.
Under the said resolution, the Office for Legal Affairs may recommend the dismissal of a complaint or appeal, with the approval of the CSC, on the following grounds:
Dismissed complaints may be refiled; however, appeals that are not perfected are barred from subsequent refiling. The dismissal is also not subject to a motion for reconsideration but can be appealed before the CSC proper.
CSC Resolution No. 2300030 was published in a newspaper of general circulation on March 25, 2023 and will take effect after 15 days from the said date, or on 10 April 2023.

498,DICT assessing possible SIM registration extension,Charie Mae F. Abarca,"Apr 24, 2023 ","Will the SIM registration period be extended or not?
The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) on Monday, April 24, said they are considering the possible extension of the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card registration period.
Two days before the mandatory measure ends, DICT Secretary Ivan John Uy said there is a possibility that the SIM registration period will be extended.
“[N]agpulong kami ng mga telco and stakeholders, ang report po ay may ilan pa pong mga kababayan na hindi pa makapag rehistro dahil sa iba't-ibang mga rason. Kino-consolidate pa namin ang report at bukas ay may final meeting kami (We met with telcos and stakeholders, and the report is that there are still some individuals who have not been able to register due to various reasons. We are still consolidating the report and tomorrow we will have a final meeting),” said Uy in an interview over DZRH on Monday.
“[Pagkatapos ay] doon kami mag aanunsyo kung may extension man o kung gaano kahaba ang extension na ibibigay (Right after that, we will announce if there is an extension or how long will this extension be) ,” Uy furthered, adding that there is a “higher than 50 percent” chance that the listing period will be prolonged.
Under Republic Act No. 11934, otherwise known as the SIM Registration Act, DICT has the prerogative to extend the registration period for another 120 days. Uy, however, stressed that the longer the extension period is, the longer electronic communication-aided crimes will persist.
“We want the SIM registration period to be completed so that these scammers will disappear,” Uy said.
The DICT official disclosed that he asked public telecommunication entities to provide the list of areas where SIM registrants remain low, stressing that this is one of the factors they are considering to determine how long the possible extension will be.
Behind the numbers
Data from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) showed that 82,845,397 cards have been registered as of April 23. This is equivalent to 49.31 percent of more than 168 million units across the archipelago.
One of the reasons behind this low registration turn out, according to Uy, is the non-compliance of some Filipinos.
“Ang pinaka malaking dahilan kung gusto niyong malaman? Matitigas po ang ulo. Umaasa na ma-eextend [kahit] anim na buwan ang ibinigay para makapag rehistro. Nakakapagtaka po dahil may nagco-complain na hindi raw sila techie pero marunong gumamit ng Gcash at Paymaya (Do you want to know the biggest reason? Hardheadedness. [They] are hoping for an extension [even if] six months were given for them to register. It makes me wonder because some people complain that they are not techie but they know how to use Gcash and Paymaya),” said Uy.

499,Here's why Senate sugar smuggling probe won't push through,Mario Casayuran,"Apr 24, 2023 ","The scheduled April 25 hearing of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee on the alleged ‘’state-sponsored’’ smuggling of sugar will not push through.
The reason, according to Senator Francis ‘’Tol’ Tolentino, committee chairman, is that Department of Agriculture (DA) Senior Undersecretary Domingo Panganiban left, Monday, April 24, for an official trip to China.
The overseas meeting will be attended by agriculture officials from different countries. His participation had been penciled earlier.
Senator Risa Hontiveros had pointed to Panganiban as the one who issued the importation order of more than 400,000 metric tons (MT) of sugar last February without an order from the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA).
She also stated that it was Panganiban who selected the three ‘’choice’’ companies to import the sugar.
Aside from Panganiban, the resource persons invited by Tolentino to appear were Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin and officials of SRA, Bureau of Customs (BOC) and private companies that would import the sugar.
