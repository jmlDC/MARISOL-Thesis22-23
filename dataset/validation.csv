21141,5,"Defense attorneys in the past two weeks have filed about 30 motions in D.C. Superior Court asking judges to dismiss gun-carrying charges against their clients based on the Bush administration's assertion that the Second Amendment gives them the right to bear arms.

But judges so far have been turning aside these pretrial motions -- three rejections to date -- and are saying a 15-year-old D.C. Court of Appeals decision upholding the District's gun ownership ban is a binding local precedent.

Robert Levy, senior fellow for constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, a D.C.-based nonprofit think tank, said the rulings shouldn't quiet concerns that the city's gun law might be vulnerable. The motions, he said, are just the first step.

""These guys will be convicted. They'll go up to the Court of Appeals. And the next step is the Supreme Court,"" Levy said. He agrees with U.S. Attorney General John D. Ashcroft's statement that gun bans violate the Second Amendment.

But Mathew Nosanchuk, litigation director for the Violence Policy Center, a gun-control advocacy group, said that as cases go through the court system, ""the Ashcroft Justice Department will not be able to continue speaking out of both sides of its mouth on the Second Amendment issue.""

The congressional debate over the Brady bill generated more publicity, but the real battle in Washington is likely to come in January, when the House and the Senate try to reconcile their differing versions of omnibus crime legislation. With only four negative votes - Sen. Paul Simon being one of them - the Senate approved last week a far-reaching $ 22 billion anti-crime package that expands the number of federal crimes that carry the death penalty, calls for building new prisons and imposes tougher sentences for the prisoners who will fill them.

The House chose a wiser, more limited approach, concentrating on putting more police officers on the street and fighting drug abuse.

In past years, contention over the Brady bill had held up passage of any crime legislation. This year, congressional leaders agreed to separate it from other crime-related measures, letting each stand on its own merits. The House passed a version of the Brady bill's provisions for a waiting period for the purchase of handguns, giving local authorities the opportunity to make a background check on prospective buyers. The Senate passed a different version.  After more than 24 hours of debate and contention, the Senate accepted something much closer to the House version and sent the measure on to President Bill Clinton for his signature.",12

""Tom Ridge had just given this gobbledygook answer,"" Katz said of the Erie congressman, ""and I just went off the charts. I flipped.""

Katz, a financial adviser from Philadelphia, was recalling a forum last month at which the half-dozen Republican candidates were addressing 200 of the state's business, legal and political leaders.

""Everyone says you can't be elected in Pennsylvania if you are in favor of gun control of any kind,"" Katz told them.

""I said, 'It's time for the Republican Party to show some leadership on this issue. We're smart people. We're surrounded by smart people. Smart people can figure out which weapons are legitimate hunting and self-protection weapons. And the ones that are not, let's get them off the streets.'

""Then I turned to Ridge and said, 'For someone who professes so much concern about violence in the schools, it would have been good if you had shown a little courage and voted for the Brady bill.' He said nothing. There was a hush in the room.""

Katz told how his 8-year-old son had been held up at gunpoint by a kid who wanted his jacket. ""I said, 'When I'm governor of Pennsylvania, I will ban the sale of assault weapons, and I'll find a way to get rid of the Saturday night specials.""",12

(I draw many examples in this post from Golway's book.) Even in the early 1800s, Tammany welcomed European immigrants into its fold, irking Whig politicians and reform-minded journalists who saw Tammany's supporters as a

""noisy rabble."" Asked one writer in 1820, ""Would you admit the populace, that patroon's footman, to vote?"" The machine clearly would, and it worked even harder to embrace immigrants after the state legislative elections of 1841, in which Irish Catholics formed a splinter party and demonstrated that their vote could swing a district toward either the Democrats or the Whigs. Tammany politicians reacted by advocating policies favored by the Catholic immigrants, such as education reforms that would keep their children from needing to recite Protestant prayers in public schools.

Such actions put Tammany in an advantageous position to woo the support of the millions of Irish Catholics who would arrive in the wake of the Great Famine (1845-1852). By the mid-1850s, roughly a quarter of New York City was Irish-born, and roughly half of the city had been born outside the United States. The film ""Gangs of New York"" (2002) did a nice job depicting New York City life of this period, with impoverished Irish immigrants often grouping together in gangs to compete for basic needs and political influence, and the Tammany organization actively courting their support with offers of food, firewood, coal, jobs, and municipal services.",10

The comic book giant is eliminating cigarette and cigar smoking from its superheroes trading cards because of a complaint from Sammy Blum.

Sammy wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine, which printed his letter in today's edition.

""I collect Marvel Masterpieces,"" Sammy wrote. ""So do some of my friends and my brothers. I found five out of 100 cards that were smoking!!""

Sammy listed the offending characters, both heroes and villains: Blaze, Gambit, Kingpin, Nick Fury and Red Skull.

""Why do they make cards for kids that show people smoking?"" wrote Sammy, the son of family physician Alan Blum, who is chairman of a Houston anti- smoking group called Doctors Ought to Care.

In a reply printed below a copy of Sammy's letter, Marvel Entertainment Group President Terry Stewart, whose company owns such characters as X-Men, Captain America and Spider-Man, announced it would eliminate smoking from future cards. Marvel spokeswoman Pamela Rutt said Sammy's letter ""really did open our eyes."" She said the company had no plans to reconsider the use of smoking characters in comic books, ""but . . . it might come up.""",10

These cases are not just the people who live with smokers. They include kids who hang out in smoky bowling alleys, people who dine in smoky restaurants, and people who work at smoky job sites.

Exposure to secondhand smoke is a serious health hazard. It is classified as a Class A carcinogen (in the same category as asbestos, benzene, and lead); it contains 4,000 chemicals (many are poisons and more than 40 are carcinogenic). A considerable amount of research shows that long-term exposure to secondhand smoke causes lung cancer, nasal cancer and cardiovascular disease; short-term exposure causes increased cholesterol, decreased coronary blood flow, headaches, asthma, bronchitis, ear infections and SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome).",8

39800,5,"The Hawaii Supreme Court has become the first in the country to rule that a state may not be able to prohibit gays from marrying. The decision gives broad protection under the state's constitution to homosexuals.

The court said any state regulation that sets up limits based on sex can be defended only if the state shows it has ""compelling"" reasons. That is the toughest legal test for a state to meet and traditionally has required it to prove that public safety is at stake.

The ruling Wednesday, which lawyers on both sides of the case describe as ""groundbreaking,"" marked the second time in the past year that state courts have found protection for gays in state constitutions. In September, the Kentucky Supreme Court safeguarded privacy rights for homosexuals by striking down an anti-sodomy law.

The rulings illustrate how activists on a range of issues often turn to state courts for vindication. Many state constitutions offer broader protections for individual rights than the federal Constitution.

The ruling reinstated a lawsuit by three Honolulu-area homosexual couples, who were denied marriage licenses.

The court ruled that under the state constitution's guarantee of equal protection of the laws any sex-based classification is ""suspect,"" putting it in a special category traditionally reserved for regulations that make distinctions based on race.

38515,3,"The Episcopal Church, which has been strained by gay-rights issues since the election of an openly gay bishop in New Hampshire eight years ago, is now divided over how to respond to the legalization of same-sex marriage in New York.

As a result, gay and lesbian Episcopalians will be allowed on Sunday to get married by priests in Brooklyn and Queens, but not in the Bronx or Manhattan or on Staten Island; in Syracuse but not in Albany.

That is because the church has not taken a firm position nationally on same-sex marriage, leaving local bishops with wide latitude to decide what priests may do when the law takes effect in New York State. In the state, with six Episcopal dioceses, the bishops are split: two have given the green light for priests to officiate at same-sex marriages, one has said absolutely not, two are undecided and one has staked out a middle ground, allowing priests to bless, but not officiate at, weddings of gay men and lesbians.

The Episcopal Church, known as one of the most welcoming to gay men and lesbians among mainline Protestant denominations, finds itself in an uneasy position on the issue -- embracing neither the clear stance against same-sex marriage taken by Roman Catholic, evangelical Protestant, Muslim, Mormon and Orthodox Jewish leaders, nor the supportive position of Reform Jewish, Unitarian Universalist and many liberal Protestant leaders. The Episcopal Church is a small denomination -- the church claims 172,623 members in New York State -- but is also prestigious and influential.

Her delusion that the term ""eunuch"" could possibly mean gay - thus affirmed by Jesus - is absurd. It is not a point of biblical interpretation; it is simply garbage theology.

The Holy Scriptures do clearly state that homosexuals are people of a depraved mind (Romans 1), so this would explain her interpretation and the fact that this blasphemy was allowed in the Post-Dispatch. Homosexuality is condemned by God and will only yield death and eternal damnation for these people. Homosexuals need to confess their sins and receive forgiveness, not attempt to rationalize it with nonsense theology.

It is time for Christians to offer tough love to a people who have a life expectancy on this Earth of less than 40 years, and an eternal life in hell. The homosexual lifestyle is a ticket to destruction.  Rev. Dale J. Pritchard Hillsboro, Ill.  Amy Adams Squire Strongheart's Feb. 10 Commentary article about same-sex marriages made a case to prove homosexuality is affirmed in the Bible. She is wrong again. The eunuchs the book of Matthew 19:4-12 is referring to are men who were castrated by other men as a punishment or converted men of a pagan religion priesthood or men born impotent. Never, in any case, does it describe the gay lifestyle.  Theo Parmer Sr.  Florissant For some time, I have been following the obvious overexposure of the sexual orientation of Amy Adams Squire Strongheart in the Post-Dispatch.
