"AFP, US counterpart's live fire drill a success as mock vessel sinks off Zambales",
"The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the United States Armed Forces declared as successful the conduct of  joint littoral live fire exercise in San Antonio, Zambales on Wednesday, April 26, when it achieved its objective to sink a mock vessel.",
"Col. Michael Logico, executive agent for the Philippine side of the Exercise Balikatan 2023, said BRP Pangasinan (PS-31) sank at 2:55 p.m. when an F-35B Joint Strike Fighters aircraft of the US delivered a laser-guided bomb to it.",
"BRP Pangasinan, a World War II-era corvette, represented an enemy force approaching the Philippine territory by sea during the exercise. The vessel was  by the Philippine Navy in 2021.",
"“It will not be fair to give all the credit to the US Air Force because a lot of the other aircraft and navy ships also contributed to the sinking of BRP Pangasinan. But what delivered the final salvo was the F-35,” Logico said.",
He said that the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) that were fired by the troops during the earlier part of the drill did not hit the target. These rockets were supposed to sink the vessel.,
"“Even before the exercise, we were also not sure if the HIMARS will hit since it is a ground-based and area weapon, not a precision weapon,” Logico said.",
"Aside from this, several other concerns have to be considered such as the location of BRP Pangasinan.",
"“The ex-PS31 was not anchored because it is too deep: 6,000 feet. So it was drifting,” he said.",
"The officer also mentioned that there were two intruders which delayed the exercise, and not one as earlier reported. One was an aerial interloper which was a private unregistered single craft aircraft that flew in the middle of the ocean near the operational area while the other one was a boat. ",
"“This resulted to the delay since they [troops] have to  [the location] and because of the drift, they found it hard to hit PS-31,” he said. ",
AFP says PH has right to hold drills within territory as 'intruder' delays Balikatan main event,
The Philippines has an “inherent and invaluable” right to conduct military exercises within its own territory.,
"(HIMARS rockets are fired during  joint littoral live fire exercise of Exercise Balikatan 2023 in San Antonio, Zambales on April 26, 2023. Photo by Noel Pabalate / MANILA BULLETIN)",
"This was stressed by Colonel Michael Logico, executive agent for the Philippine side of the Exercise Balikatan 2023, after the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the United States Armed Forces conducted  joint littoral live fire exercise in San Antonio, Zambales on Wednesday, April 26, which served as the main event of this year's Balikatan.",
"“We are exercising inside of our territorial waters and inside of our territorial airspace and that is our inherent and invaluable right to exercise within our territory,” Logico told reporters after the live fire drill. ",
"The exercise was highlighted by the sinking of former Philippine Navy corvette BRP Pangasinan (PS-31) at 12 nautical miles from the shoreline through the firing of rockets, artilleries, and other aviation weapons. ",
The location of the ship is well within the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Philippines. The exercise was also held at approximately 100 nautical miles from Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal which was seized by China from the Philippines in a tense standoff in 2012.,
"Logico said he would not want to anticipate China’s reaction to the AFP and US military’s joint drills near the Scarborough Shoal. “I cannot speak for them (China),” he said.",
But the Balikatan main event was marked by a surprising delay when the radars of the AFP and US military detected an aerial intruder flying within the operational area where the sinking exercise was being held. The interloper was later identified as a “a private unregistered single craft aircraft.”,
Logico said they had to delay the firing of the rockets to sink BRP Pangasinan since it could pose danger to the interloper.,

"The live fire exercise was highlighted by the sinking exercise (SINKEX) where 1,400 Filipino and American marines, soldiers, sailors, and airmen fired rockets, artilleries, and other weapons to sink the former BRP Pangasinan, a World War II-era corvette.",
The drill was aimed at showcasing the interoperability of Filipino and American troops in conducting maritime and coastal defense operations.,
"“This training increased the exercise’s realism  a key priority shared between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the US military,” said Lt. Gen. William  of US Marine Corps Pacific and US director for the exercise.",

The intelligence center provided  operational picture of the entire area and coordination between the different firing units are processed in that particular location. The orders were also handed to the firing units through the CIFEC.",
"Simulating a real-world scenario where troops have to take out an adversary ship, the first rocket fire was aimed at the center mast of BRP Pangasinan to take away  systems while the remaining five shots were supposed to sink it.",
"However, the first shot missed the target since the vessel “is drifting so it was not in the correct location,” a US military personnel announced. The first shot was located at approximately six to nine meters away from the vessel while the five other shots hit different points.",
A second set of HIMARS rockets were then prepared for firing as the CIFEC calculated the new position of BRP Pangasinan. But an aerial interloper was detected by the radars of the AFP and US Armed Forces which delayed the exercise for a few minutes.,

The interloper was a private unregistered single craft aircraft in the middle of the ocean,” a US military personnel announced.",
"Prior to the exercise, picket vessels from the Philippine Navy and Philippine Coast Guard were deployed to secure the operational area.

Blended learning being implemented by some schools amid extreme heat --- DepEd,
"The Department of Education (DepEd) on Wednesday, April 26, said that blended learning is already being implemented in some schools to address the concerns of learners, teachers, and parents regarding the conduct of in-person classes during the dry season.",
"“Some schools are already implemented blended learning,” DepEd Spokesman Michael Poa told the Manila Bulletin in a Viber message.",
"“Classes are held at certain times of the day when it’s not too hot but supplemented by ADMs [Alternative Delivery Modes],” he added.",
"On April 20, DepEd issued a reminder to schools that they are allowed to suspend classes and implement modular distance learning in consideration of the “well-being of the learners affected by extreme climate conditions as they attend in-person classes.”",
"The agency also reiterated that the DepEd Order No. 037 s. of 2022 or the “Guidelines on the Cancellation or Suspension of Classes and Work in Schools in the Event of Natural Disasters, Power Outages/Power Interruptions, and Other Calamities,” provides for the implementation of modular distance learning “in the event of canceled or suspended classes due to natural disasters, calamities, and human-induced hazards to ensure learning continuity and that  and objectives are met.”",
"Asked how many schools have temporarily shifted to blended learning since the DepEd memo was issued, Poa said that field offices are “currently collating” the initial data.",
Shortened class hours,
"Meanwhile, Poa reiterated that DepEd regional offices have already issued their respective advisories on matters related to the conduct of in-person classes during hot weather.",
"Last week, the Teachers’ Dignity Coalition (TDC) urged DepEd to consider shorter class hours or class days instead of implementing modular distance learning which is “not effective.”",
"“The pure modular has been proven ineffective, that's why we have learning gaps now,” said TDC National Chairperson Benjo Basas said in a mix of English and Filipino.",
"Instead of shifting to pure modular learning, TDC said that shorter periods of face-to-face classes would be more effective.",
"As a response, Poa noted that “simply shortening classes will also not be effective for learning, especially since we are on learning recovery right now.”",
"To address the problem of extreme heat in schools, TDC said that DepEd should focus on long-term solutions.",
"For TDC, the long-term solutions include reducing the number of students per class to avoid overcrowding, building more classrooms, and hiring more teachers.",
Basas noted that providing proper ventilation like installing enough electric fans or air conditioning systems in schools would also be crucial in addressing the problem.,
"Poa, in a Viber message to reporters on April 24, noted that while schools have Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE), this will not be enough to put up air conditioning systems in all classrooms.",
"“Kaya po mariin naming pinapaalalahan ang ating mga school heads na kung hindi na po conducive ang learning environment sa mga paaralan nang dahil sa init ng panahon maari po silang mag suspinde ng in-person at mag-implement ng ADMs (That's why we strongly remind our school heads that if the learning environment in schools is no longer conducive due to the heat of the weather, they can suspend in-person and implement ADMs),” Poa added.",
