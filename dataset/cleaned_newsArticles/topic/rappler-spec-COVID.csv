"As a result of the slow response, over half of the 800,000 liters of oil on MT Princess Empress is estimated to have already spilled in parts of Oriental Mindoro, Palawan, and Antique, based on analyses of international experts and on the black oil collected from affected shorelines. ",,rappler,2023-04-03

"He also urged the Marcos administration to declare a “national state of calamity” in response to the oil spill since the cleanup would take not just months but years, citing the 13 years it took to rehabilitate the areas in Guimaras Island affected by the oil spill from the sinking of the oil tanker MT Solar in 2006.

DSWD to go after scammers who target seniors,,rappler,2023-03-01
"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) said it would go after those who post disinformation online, or who send text messaging scams, deceiving unsuspecting senior citizens.",,rappler,2023-03-01

"“That’s the marching order of the secretary. Secretary Rex Gatchalian made it clear to us, the officials and employees of the DSWD, that we will go after these individuals,” Lopez said. ",,rappler,2023-03-01
"“That’s why we’re warning them, we’ve been coordinating with other agencies such as the PNP, NBI and DICT  up with a plan to counter this. And of course, to pinpoint those responsible for this modus operandi,” he added. “We want to catch them. We want to file a case against them. So that we stop the proliferation of these kinds of activities,” the DSWD spokesperson said. ",,rappler,2023-03-01
Lopez was reacting to a February 28 statement of the National Commission on Senior Citizens (NCSC) correcting disinformation over the distribution of social pension benefits for indigent  senior citizens.,,rappler,2023-03-01

"“There are three points we want to clarify and disabuse in the minds of senior citizens. First, it is not true that non-pensioners will also receive P1k a month, because Republic Act 9994 (Expanded Senior Citizens Act of 2010) which provides or gives senior citizens social pensions only to indigent senior citizens is not yet amended,” NCSC Commissioner Reymar Mansilungan said in a video statement posted on their website. ",,rappler,2023-03-01
"They clarified that it was also not true that the assistance would be increased to P1,000 a month just yet. ",,rappler,2023-03-01
"Although there is an amendment to the law passed in 2022, Republic Act 11916 (An Act Increasing the Social Pension of Indigent Senior Citizens),  that increased the amount to P1,000, the law only took effect after the 2023 budget was already submitted to Congress. ",,rappler,2023-03-01

"“This will be a process, where I can discuss this with the President, that I am now ready to be appointed, if and when that would be his decision.

Marcos defends cost of foreign trips: It’s about return on investment,,rappler,2023-01-24
"MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday, January 23, defended his frequent travels, telling a panel of television journalists and presenters to “look at [the expenses] as ROI (return on investment).”",,rappler,2023-01-24
"“In terms of the cost, you know, the way I see it, you have to look at it as ROI. Do we bring something back or do we not?” said Marcos in an interview with several select media personalities in Malacañang Palace.",,rappler,2023-01-24
"Marcos was asked if his administration would publicize how much his many trips – to Indonesia, Singapore, the United States, Singapore again, Cambodia, Thailand, and Brussels in 2022, and China and Switzerland in 2023 – cost Filipino taxpayers.",,rappler,2023-01-24
"Initially, the Philippine president said he did not have the figures ready. When pressed if they would eventually be “revealed,” Marcos said it would, “once we’ve calculated everything.”",,rappler,2023-01-24
"Of his trips, three are state visits while the rest were made to attend international and regional gatherings.",,rappler,2023-01-24
"In defending his trip, Marcos highlighted the pledges or promises his administration got from governments and private businesses.",,rappler,2023-01-24
"“Now, the measure of success will be, you know, cost-benefit, very simple. How much effort did you put into it? It’s not just the money. It’s the time that you put into it. It’s the time and the effort that goes into it is really… That’s what I was trying to explain earlier. The reason that we have everyone on the delegation,” he said.",,rappler,2023-01-24
"Pledges, however, don’t always turn into anything concrete. Marcos highlighted the over $22 billion pledged to the Philippines during his January 2023 state visit to China – but did not mention that China pledged almost just as much during his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte’s time without most of them materializing.",,rappler,2023-01-24
What exactly would “ROI” mean in the context of his trips abroad?,,rappler,2023-01-24
"The President’s answer was long and indirect: “So again, the way I approach this is ROI. How much did you spend? How much did you get? And again, as I’m saying, if we get just one of the MOUs, isa lang, napakahina naman natin if isa lang ang makuha natin. Hindi namin ginagawa trabaho namin kung isa lang makukuha natin. But sabihin na lang natin, isa lang ang makuha natin. Bawi na lahat nung trip ko.”",,rappler,2023-01-24
"(…just one, that’s really  of us if we only get one. That means we aren’t doing our jobs right if we only get one. But say we do get one? That makes up for all my trips.)",,rappler,2023-01-24
"Marcos also defended his delegation size, saying it was just select Cabinet, their staff, and security. What he didn’t mention, however, are the people who tag along who are not staff or security – his sons who aren’t in government, for instance, or the spouses of top officials.",,rappler,2023-01-24
"Marcos vowed “accountability and transparency in everything that we do,” when pressed by CNN Philippines’ Rico Hizon on the release of details about his trips.",,rappler,2023-01-24
"But the President disagreed with the TV anchor, who said it was hard to invite investors if “there’s a lack of transparency, accountability.”",,rappler,2023-01-24
"“This has not been an issue that the private businesses bring up. They bring up ease of doing business. They bring up the cost of energy. They bring up the problems of legislative guarantees,” said Marcos.",,rappler,2023-01-24
He added: “So the critics will have their say. But those who are actually contemplating putting good money into the Philippines have other issues and that is not… accountability and transparency is not an issue.”,,rappler,2023-01-24
"The Palace has yet to release expense reports on Marcos’ visits. It has also not officially made delegation lists public, despite repeated requests from the media.",,rappler,2023-01-24
"In all of Marcos’ visits around the world, both he and the Palace have highlighted the importance of selling the Philippines to the world, particularly in the economic aftermath of COVID-19.",,rappler,2023-01-24
"Marcos himself said the results won’t be instant. “Proseso ‘yan….Pagka hindi tayo bumiyahe at nagpakita diyan sa mga conference na ‘yan, hindi tayo iniisip. Wala sa isip nila ang Pilipinas (It’s a process. If we do not travel and attend those conferences, we won’t be top of mind. The Philippines won’t even be considered),” he said.",,rappler,2023-01-24
"But the President said part of it is also about introducing himself. “I’m the new kid on the block. Nobody knows who I am. Kailangan kong magpakilala (I need to introduce myself),” said Marcos, whose father was president and later, dictator, for over two decades.",,rappler,2023-01-24
"“That’s important also na magkaroon ng personal, halimbawa personal sa mga lider na kaya ko ngayon – hindi ko kayang gawin ‘yun dati. Ngayon kaya kong buhatin ang telepono, tumawag diyan sa lahat, tatanggapin naman ang tawag ko at mayroon na kaming mapapag-usapan, and that’s very, very important,” he added.",,rappler,2023-01-24

Former socioeconomic planning secretary Solita “Winnie” Monsod shared her assessment of Marcos’ Davos trip in her January 23 blog.,,rappler,2023-01-24
"“Generally, a cost-benefit analysis is done before an activity is undertaken, and only if the perceived benefits exceed the costs of the activity will it be undertaken. Obviously this was not done with respect to the President’s Davos trip. If this is an indication of how decisions are made by the President, it does not augur very well for the country,” Monsod said.",,rappler,2023-01-24
"Monsod said that one of the goals of the WEF trip was for the soft launch of the proposed Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF). Judging by the video footage of this event, she said, there were only  “13 anonymous people out of a possible 2,500 WEF participants” who showed interest by attending the soft launch.",,rappler,2023-01-24

"She also said that based on a “very understated cost of travel, food and  the Swiss trip bill would “come up to P65.35 million.”",,rappler,2023-01-24
"“A trip costing at least P65 million results in expressions of interest about the MIF/SWF from, at most, 13 nameless attendees of the WEF, if we assume that all who attended the country dialogue were impressed,” she said.",,rappler,2023-01-24

So it is again – we are always…. If you have been listening to the ASEAN pronouncements, it is always to the rule of law, it is always UNCLOS that we talk about.”",,rappler,2023-01-21

"Marcos flies to Davos as Philippine inflation hits a 14-year high, driven mostly by the rising cost of goods. The President has said the problem is our dependence on imports and that improving local production is important in solving the rise in food prices. Marcos is concurrently agriculture chief, meaning keeping production in check and food prices down is primarily his job, too. ",,rappler,2023-01-17

Cayetano wants faster aid dole-outs through LGUs while cutting admin costs,,rappler,2022-11-10

"“If we simply directly help them, cut out all of the administrative cost, katulad ng ginawa natin sa Bayanihan 1 and 2, idiretso sa LGU, idiretso sa pamilya, nakatipid na tayo ng 10% of P200 billion, which is P20 billion. Masisigurado pang hindi doble, masisigurado pang lahat mabibigyan, at masisigurado pang madali nilang makuha,” said Cayetano.",,rappler,2022-11-10
"(If we simply directly help them, cut out all of the administrative costs, just like what we did with Bayanihan 1 and 2, we can give the funds straight to the LGUs and to the different families.

We can ensure that nobody gets aid twice, we can ensure that everyone is a recipient, and we can ensure that they can get it with ease.)",,rappler,2022-11-10
"The P200 billion Cayetano was referring to was the P200 billion in subsidies and aid that are spread throughout the 2023 GAB.  his proposal to the Singapore government’s recent SGD $1.5-billion initiative (P62.53 billion), which aimed at helping Singaporeans cope with the rising cost of living.",,rappler,2022-11-10

"“Hindi ba natin pinapahirapan ang buhay natin sa gobyerno by putting [subsidies] in different agencies, at hindi ba natin pinapahirapan ang buhay ng nga Pilipino na kanya-kanya silang nag-a-apply sa iba’t-ibang ahensya?” Cayetano asked.",,rappler,2022-11-10
"(Aren’t we making our lives in the government difficult by putting subsidies in different agencies, and aren’t we making Filipinos’ lives difficult by making them apply on their own with different agencies?",,rappler,2022-11-10

Bersamin circular expands powers of Marcos administration OICs,,rappler,2022-10-26

"The WJP said in its media release that the Philippines’ overall rule of law score increased 1.4% in the 2022 index, with an overall score of 0.47 out of 1. ",,rappler,2022-10-26
"The Philippines is now ranked 97th out of 140 countries worldwide, rising five positions since 2021. But it remains one of the worst in the region – 13th out of 15th in East Asia and the Pacific, with the last two places held by Myanmar and Cambodia, where there was a coup and civil unrest, respectively, in recent years.",,rappler,2022-10-26
"While the WJP found that adherence to the rule of law fell in 61% of countries in 2022, the Philippines emerged “among the minority of countries to see its Rule of Law Index score increase this year.”",,rappler,2022-10-26

"Worldwide, the index data showed that authoritarian trends from before the COVID-19 pandemic – such as “weaker checks on executive power and increased attacks on the media” – continued to weaken the rule of law.",,rappler,2022-10-26
"However, the WJP noted that declines are less widespread and extreme than in 2021, when COVID-19 restrictions were higher and disrupted justice systems. Governments also exercised emergency powers that “curtailed civic freedoms and bypassed transparency mechanisms.”",,rappler,2022-10-26
"The WJP Rule of Law Index is a leading source for rule of law data. The 2022 index covers 140 countries and relies on surveys of more than 150,000 households and 3,600 legal practitioners and experts.",,rappler,2022-10-26
The WJP reported that the Philippines had an improvement in the factor measuring “order and security.” This measures “how well a society ensures the security of persons and property.”,,rappler,2022-10-26
The country’s order and security score rose by 0.04 to 0.66 out of 1 in 2022. This was relatively the most significant increase – the Philippines also improved in upholding fundamental rights (0.40) and in criminal justice (0.32) but the score for these two rose by only 0.01.,,rappler,2022-10-26
"Meanwhile, the score for upholding civil justice (0.45) dropped by 0.01.",,rappler,2022-10-26
"All other factors in the Philippines’ rule of law stayed stagnant from the previous year – constraints on government powers (0.48), absence of corruption (0.44), open government (0.50), and regulatory enforcement (0.48). This means that the country did not improve nor worsen in these aspects.",,rappler,2022-10-26

"It was Dela Rosa and Cascolan – both members of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) Class of 1986 – who created Oplan Double Barrel, the supposed manual for Duterte’s campaign against illegal drugs.",,rappler,2022-10-24
"The “war on drugs” was famously Duterte’s key campaign promise in 2016.

"Aside from his stint in Davao de Oro, a province close to Davao City, Cascolan held several posts in the Davao Region Police Office, including a stint as the chief of directorial staff.

"The DepEd has been under scrutiny after the Commission on Audit (COA), in its 2021 report, flagged the purchase of “pricey” and “outdated” entry-level laptops for teachers priced at P58,300 ($990.04) each. ",,rappler,2022-10-21
"Purchased through the Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM), the DepEd’s Intel Celeron laptops ended up more expensive than the MacBook Air with the advanced M1 chip, whose price starts at P57,990 ($984.83). ",,rappler,2022-10-21
"During the Senate hearings, a DepEd official revealed that the memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the DepEd and PS-DBM was only signed on May 28, 2021 – contrary to earlier statements of other education officials that it  on February 16, 2021. ",,rappler,2022-10-21
"Senators had said that because of this, it was possible the deal between the DepEd and PS-DBM on the purchase of laptops was flawed.",,rappler,2022-10-21
One of the biggest questions during Thursday’s hearing was why there was a discrepancy in the date of the MOA. ,,rappler,2022-10-21
"“It got  because you saw how, in the beginning, they fought over the dates, but it was proven that until May, the MOA wasn’t finished,” said Tolentino, chair of the ",,rappler,2022-10-21
"“They had a MOA that was dated February 16, 2021. It was definitely planned. The conspiracy angle is there,” he added.",,rappler,2022-10-21
"The eight-hour hearing tried to identify who was responsible for the allegedly antedated MOA, prompting DepEd officials to point fingers at each other.",,rappler,2022-10-21
"Former DepEd procurement officer Mark Bragado questioned the MOA, which he said was  until May 2021 – shortly before the laptops were purchased – but was dated February of the same year. ",,rappler,2022-10-21
He said the antedated memo came from DepEd Undersecretary for Finance Anne Sevilla and her staff. Sevilla denied Bragado’s allegation.,,rappler,2022-10-21
"“Contrary to what Atty. Bragado is saying, the date in the MOA did  from us. It is from him [Bragado],” Sevilla said.",,rappler,2022-10-21
Neither Sevilla nor Bragado admitted who was responsible for the February date in the MOA.,,rappler,2022-10-21
"The Senate panel highlighted, however, a message from Sevilla in a group chat, asking Bragado to explain the delay in the MOA when the P2.4 billion was already obligated – or included in the budget – as early as February 2021.",,rappler,2022-10-21
Bragado said an agreement was reached on April 30 that year that a separate MOA needed to be made for the P2.4-billion purchase. He maintained his claim that the February 16 MOA was antedated.,,rappler,2022-10-21
Another question raised during the hearing was why former budget secretary Wendell Avisado allowed funds meant to purchase data load for students to be used for the procurement of the allegedly overpriced laptops. ,,rappler,2022-10-21
"Pressed by Tolentino, Avisado said he could not remember if he even approved it or not.",,rappler,2022-10-21
"“Really, I cannot recall, Mr. Chairman. I will accept any responsibility if I have approved, and then now, I am saying I cannot recall because that is the truth. I cannot recall,” Avisado told the  ",,rappler,2022-10-21
The blue  investigation showed that Avisado approved a request from the DepEd to use P2.4 billion from its maintenance and other operating expenses fund for the laptop deal.,,rappler,2022-10-21
The fund was intended to provide students with data load at a time when the DepEd implemented a remote learning setup because of the COVID-19 pandemic.,,rappler,2022-10-21
State auditor Job Aguirre presented to  his findings on the quality of the laptops purchased.  ,,rappler,2022-10-21
"One of the government-purchased Dell laptops with an Intel Celeron processor took almost a minute to boot up, something that an HP laptop with an i5 processor and a price range of P50,000 to P60,000 ($848.89 to $1,018.67) took only less than 30 seconds to do.",,rappler,2022-10-21
"COA checked price in retail stores and online. The laptops procured by DepEd for about P60,000 are available on Amazon for about P20,000 and in retail stores for about P22,490. COA considers prices about 10% above market value as ""excessive."" ",,rappler,2022-10-21
"It also took 15 seconds to load Microsoft Excel on the government-bought Dell laptop, while the same process only lasted for 2.15 seconds using the HP laptop.",,rappler,2022-10-21
"For Zoom’s web conferencing app, it took 22.18 seconds on Dell, while it took 2.96 seconds on HP.",,rappler,2022-10-21

"The COA said that out of the 2,378 laptops that DepEd received so far, at least 1,678 remain in storage. ",,rappler,2022-10-21

"CEBU CITY, Philippines – The Philippines’ Department of Health (DOH) reported detecting its first cases of the COVID-19 Omicron subvariant XBB and the XBC variant on Tuesday, October 18.",,rappler,2022-10-20
"At least 81 cases of XBB were detected in two regions in the country, while 193 XBC cases were detected in 11 regions.",,rappler,2022-10-20
Here’s what we know so far about the XBB subvariant and the XBC variant.,,rappler,2022-10-20
"The XBB, another subvariant of the more transmissible Omicron variant, reportedly has been behind the increase in cases in Singapore in recent weeks. ",,rappler,2022-10-20
"The country had already lifted almost all COVID-19 restrictions on August 28, only requiring masks in public transit and hospital settings.",,rappler,2022-10-20
"According to the Singapore Ministry of Health, the country reported a 7,916 seven-day moving average of local cases as of Thursday, October 20. The week-on-week infection ratio was at 1.09. An infection ratio of 1 indicates that the spread of the virus is slowing down.",,rappler,2022-10-20
"While the XBB appears to evade vaccine immunity and is even more transmissible than the BA.5 subvariant, Singapore health authorities said there was no evidence that the variant has caused more severe illness in patients who have been infected so far. ",,rappler,2022-10-20
Most infections reported mild symptoms similar to previous Omicron infections. ,,rappler,2022-10-20
"“There has been no evidence of XBB subvariant causing more severe illness than previous variants. In fact, our local data in the last two weeks shows that XBB cases are estimated to have a 30% lower risk of  to Omicron BA.5 variant cases,” the Singaporean government said in a statement published online on October 14.",,rappler,2022-10-20
"Singapore’s health minister Ong Ye Kung said the recent spike in cases would be a “short and sharp” curve, expecting it to end by mid-November. He didn’t see the need to reimpose COVID-19 restrictions in the country. ",,rappler,2022-10-20
Health experts say those who are updated with their vaccinations and boosters or have been recently infected within the past three months have better protection against new variants and subvariants.,,rappler,2022-10-20
"In the Philippines, health authorities also do not see a need to tighten restrictions despite the detection of the first XBB cases.",,rappler,2022-10-20
DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said in Filipino on Tuesday that “the life cycle of a virus includes mutations and new variants. The system is ready for these new cases.”,,rappler,2022-10-20
"The Philippines, which recorded 1,379 new cases on Wednesday, October 19, currently has 23,347 active cases",,rappler,2022-10-20
"The current positivity rate nationwide is at about 13.8%, above the World Health Organization standard of 5%.",,rappler,2022-10-20
"Given XBB’s immune evasiveness as well as Singapore’s experience, a spike or surge in the Philippines is possible. But a surge does not necessarily equate to an increase in hospitalizations as long as enough of the population is fully vaccinated and if a high number of the country’s eligible population are boosted.",,rappler,2022-10-20

There is still little data available on the XBC variant.,,rappler,2022-10-20
"The XBC, which is said to be a  of Delta and BA.2, is currently under monitoring and investigation, according to the DOH. Current vaccines are still effective against the Delta variant. ",,rappler,2022-10-20
"The Philippines is currently working on procuring bivalent boosters that target the Omicron variant specifically, as well as the original COVID-19 strain. Bivalent vaccines are shots that target two different strains of a virus. ",,rappler,2022-10-20

"“According to the Singapore Ministry of Health, there is no evidence that proves that this new subvariant causes more severe illness,” Vergeire said in Filipino.",,rappler,2022-10-18

"COA said that the BCDA paid P85.945 million in 2020, and P83.044 million in 2021, to contractors and suppliers for utilities and maintenance of the National Government Administrative Center (NGAC) Buildings and the New Clark City Athlete’s Village that were used as quarantine facilities.",,rappler,2022-09-13
"The COA noted that the BCDA, in its memorandum of agreement with the DOH and Clark Development Corporation (CDC), failed to seek reimbursement  for operating and maintaining the temporary quarantine facilities, and included only medical manpower expenses and meals.",,rappler,2022-09-13

"MANILA, Philippines – Several programs of the Department of Health (DOH) – among them pandemic response, healthcare support for cancer patients, and COVID-19 allowance for healthcare workers – face budget cuts in the National Expenditure Program (NEP). ",,rappler,2022-09-13
"This was revealed during the budget deliberations at the House of Representatives on Monday, September 12, where DOH Officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire appealed to lawmakers for more funds so the agency could sustain the affected programs and benefits. ",,rappler,2022-09-13
"Vergeire said the DOH proposed P95 billion for the COVID-19 response, but the budget allocated in the NEP was slashed to P24.49 billion. She said that though infections are declining, more funds will be needed to procure the next generation of COVID-19 vaccines. ",,rappler,2022-09-13
"Iloilo Representative Janette Garin, a former health secretary, also noticed that budget for the prevention and control  diseases was also cut. ",,rappler,2022-09-13
"“If you look at  of the 2022 budget vis-a-vis the 2023 proposed budget, there is a reduction of 71.21%.

",,rappler,2022-09-13
But Vergeire said that the current fund for that line item would be sufficient since the DOH wouldn’t be needing to procure personal protective equipment sets and GeneXpert catridges used for COVID-19 testing because the agency has enough stocks for 2023. ,,rappler,2022-09-13

Bagong Henerasyon Party-list Representative Bernadette Herrera asked Vergeire about funding assistance for cancer patients. ,,rappler,2022-09-13
"On September 8, Deputy Speaker and Batangas Representative Ralph Recto clarified that the “mother funds” that covered the Cancer Control Program and the Cancer Assistance Fund “did not suffer any cuts in the proposed 2023 national budget,” and in fact about to get an increase. What was removed from the NEP were the “earmarks specifying the amounts that will go to cancer control and cancer assistance.”",,rappler,2022-09-13
"“What the House should do is not to merely restore the earmarks, but to increase the funding for both cancer control and cancer assistance, and make them distinct and separate programs,” Recto said. ",,rappler,2022-09-13
"Pressed if the assistance funds for 2022 were used, Vergeire said Republic Act No. 11215 or the National Integrated Cancer Control Act was not fully implemented in 2022 due to “contradicting provisions” in the General Appropriations Act (GAA).",,rappler,2022-09-13
"However, Vergeire said that the DOH crafted a joint memorandum circular together with the DBM in August to implement the cancer assistance fund. ",,rappler,2022-09-13
"“There were these contradicting provisions within the GAA of 2022 versus the specific IRR (implementing rules and regulations) and the law that we have, which is why we need to clarify how funds would be used,” Vergeire added. ",,rappler,2022-09-13
"In February 2019, then-president Rodrigo Duterte signed the law to provide affordable and accessible medical treatment for cancer patients.",,rappler,2022-09-13
"During the deliberations, it was also bared that COVID-19 benefits and allowances of healthcare workers under the proposed 2023 budget will only last until the first quarter. ",,rappler,2022-09-13
"“We have submitted a total of P76 billion for us to be able to sustain the provision of these benefits and allowances to our healthcare workers, but we were only provided around three months of this P76 billion,” Vergeire said. The approved amount under the NEP was only P19 billion. Health workers have been protesting over delays in the provision of benefits amid the pandemic.",,rappler,2022-09-13

"Solante, who is also part of the country’s vaccine expert panel, reiterated his earlier position that “face mask should be the last to go” in terms of pandemic health protocols.",,rappler,2022-09-12

"But there was something out of the ordinary during those four in-person events held at the Ateneo Gym that long weekend. Amid the usual pomp that went with  ceremonies was the presence of a shoemaker’s table, or as they say in Filipino, “ang puwesto ni manong sapatero.” ",,rappler,2022-09-10

"To break its series of online graduations ceremonies forced by the pandemic lockdowns, ADMU-LS lined up  rites on the three-day long weekend this year. The first of the four events was for half of the graduating Class of 2022. Sunday had recognition rites for Batch 2021 in the morning, and 2020 in the afternoon. The other half of the Class of 2022 had their turn on Monday, the Araw ng Kagitingan holiday.",,rappler,2022-09-10

"For the anxious graduate, the excited parent, and the proud faculty member wearing their best outfits or even full academic regalia, a broken heel or a damaged sole could be hell. In fact, this scary situation has happened once too many in the post-lockdown era.",,rappler,2022-09-10

"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines’ top medical experts said on Thursday, September 8, they are against easing the face mask requirement when outdoors, saying that it would send a wrong message to the public that they “should not be afraid of COVID-19 anymore.”",,rappler,2022-09-08
"“If you relax the requirement for the use of the face mask then it basically gives the impression to a lot of Filipinos that there’s no need…. ‘You should not be afraid of COVID-19 anymore and there’s no even need to vaccinate,'” said Dr. Maricar Limpin, past president of the Philippine College of Physicians (PCP), during a roundtable discussion on COVID-19 vaccination at the New World Hotel in Makati. ",,rappler,2022-09-08
"“So paano na ang mangyayari sa ating (What would happen to our) booster vaccination program? That would weaken our campaign,” she added. ",,rappler,2022-09-08
Limpin was answering questions from the media regarding the Philippine government’s plan to relax the requirement to wear face masks outdoors after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. “verbally” approved the coronavirus task force’s  The Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Disease (IATF)  of health experts and economic managers of the country. ,,rappler,2022-09-08
Department of Health (DOH) officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said that an executive order is needed for the new rules to take effect.,,rappler,2022-09-08
"In a statement sent to reporters on Thursday, DOH director  Dr. Albert Domingo said that the agency’s position has always been for the public “to continue on masking, but there were several data that were presented also that led to this decision.”",,rappler,2022-09-08
"“We needed to balance between health and the economy, and what we  would be, this will be done among low-risk individuals and in low-risk settings. This means that optional masking will only be done outdoors, in settings where it is not crowded, in settings where there is good ventilation, and this will be done among low-risk individuals – meaning, not the senior citizens, not those  not the children, and definitely not those having COVID-19 symptoms,” Domingo said.

"Press Secretary Trixie Cruz Angeles said on Wednesday, September 7, that the new rules will have pilot implementation in the last quarter of 2022, provided that the COVID-19 booster coverage improves.",,rappler,2022-09-08
"On the sidelines of the roundtable discussion on Thursday, infectious diseases specialist Dr. Rontgene Solante said the implementation of the new rules on masking would be challenging. ",,rappler,2022-09-08
"“We know by history, it’s difficult in terms of implementation but it’s important for us, medical societies, even media, to again reiterate the importance and inform the population at risk that the risk will still be there even if in an outdoor [setting], and if they will not be wearing face masks. So  and specific messaging will really be important when we implement this policy,” he said. ",,rappler,2022-09-08
"Solante, who is also part of the country’s vaccine expert panel, reiterated his earlier position that “face mask should be the last to go” in terms of pandemic health protocols. ",,rappler,2022-09-08
This development on the easing of face mask requirements came after Cebu City’s local order making face masks outdoors optional. ,,rappler,2022-09-08
"Reacting to critics who said that the Philippines is among the few countries that continue to have a masking mandate, Solante said that it is not right to “benchmark” the policies with others since each has a different context and situation. ",,rappler,2022-09-08
"“Magkakaiba ‘yung healthcare system natin. Magkaiba ‘yung priority ng mga bansa…. For me, benchmarking dahil generalized na ‘uy Singapore gumawa na nito, Vietnam, gumawa na nito, eh tayo sasama din tayo.’ No,” Solante said, adding that government also needs to consider other factors, such as health systems, manpower, and availability of treatment. ",,rappler,2022-09-08
"(Each country has a different healthcare system. Each country has different priorities…. For me, benchmarking just because Singapore and Vietnam have already eased theirs, we will follow suit. No.)",,rappler,2022-09-08
"“I think these are an important part when we consider a decision. Our anti-virals. When you say Thailand, Singapore – their government have good healthcare support for their vulnerable sectors,” he added. ",,rappler,2022-09-08
"A number of countries, including those in Europe and the United States, have already dropped their mandatory wearing of face masks in most public places, although this is still  in some indoor places.

(Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this story cited the PopCom’s figure of a 71% increase in virus-related deaths. This has been corrected.)",,rappler,2022-09-08
"The PSA’s figure for COVID-19 deaths in 2021 is much higher than the Department of Health’s death toll, which is pegged at 62,167 as of Wednesday, September 7. The DOH’s tally includes deaths from 2020, the pandemic’s first year.",,rappler,2022-09-08
"The PopCom explained that the PSA has a different set of records from the DOH. According to PopCom Executive Director Juan Antonio Perez III, the PSA follows the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on reporting COVID-19 deaths, which were endorsed by the DOH in 2020.",,rappler,2022-09-08
"The WHO guidelines provide that COVID-19 may be declared as the cause of death in cases where COVID-19 was confirmed by a test, and in cases where no test confirmed the disease but a doctor clinically diagnosed the patient with COVID-19.",,rappler,2022-09-08
"“DOH reports only laboratory-confirmed deaths that have entered their surveillance system, thus the smaller number,” Perez said, adding that the DOH figure was therefore ",,rappler,2022-09-08
"For 2022, the PSA recorded 10,226 coronavirus-related deaths as of May 21, placing the total death toll from the start of the pandemic to May 2022 at around 146,137. COVID-19 is one of the leading causes of death in the country, according to data from the PSA as of April 2022.",,rappler,2022-09-08
"The 2021 PSA death toll was 265,493 more than 2020’s 613,936. It represents a 43% increase – a vast difference from the rise in number of deaths averaging around 1% to 5% during “normal years,” the PopCom said.",,rappler,2022-09-08
"The crude death rate (CDR) in 2021 – or the ratio of the number of deaths occurring within one year to the mid-year population expressed per 1,000 population – was estimated at 8.02 per thousand Filipinos. This is a sharp rise from the rate of 5.6 per thousand in 2020, the PopCom reported. The PopCom said the last time a CDR was around this high was in 1958, when it was at 8.4.",,rappler,2022-09-08
"The deadliest month in 2021 was September, when 119,758 Filipinos died. While this number represents all causes of death in September, at this time, the Philippines faced a record-breaking surge in COVID-19 cases driven by the Delta variant.",,rappler,2022-09-08
"Meanwhile, thousands of lives were claimed by other diseases in 2021. These included ischemic heart disease or heart attacks, which were up by 29.7%; cerebrovascular disease or strokes, which were up by 15.3%; diabetes mellitus, up by 21%; and hypertension, up by 31.5%.",,rappler,2022-09-08
"Deaths due to malnutrition increased by 47%. Meanwhile, deaths from various forms of cancers were down by 10.3%.",,rappler,2022-09-08
"“Many of the diseases that caused increased mortality are preventable at the primary level of care, but the health system was not flexible enough to treat and care for both COVID and non-COVID patients,” Perez said.",,rappler,2022-09-08
"“On the other hand, the decrease in cancer-related deaths was most likely due to the lack of tertiary level of diagnostic and therapeutic care, as COVID cases crowded out actual and undiagnosed cancer patients,” he added.",,rappler,2022-09-08
Perez called for more resources for the Philippine health system as it was “severely challenged” in 2021.,,rappler,2022-09-08

COA: PhilHealth pays P782M for RT-PCR tests despite improper documents,,rappler,2022-08-23
The Commission on Audit (COA) is looking deeper into why the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) paid nearly P800 million for Reverse Transcription – Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests done by a contractor which submitted improper documents.,,rappler,2022-08-23
State auditors said all documents it reviewed regarding these transactions at the early part of the pandemic were either “partially or not fully filled out.”,,rappler,2022-08-23
The COA report was referring to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between PhilHealth and a contractor which said a cash advance of P100 million was released as seed fund to pay for RT-PCR tests. Later this would be subject to replenishment as the required documents are submitted.,,rappler,2022-08-23
"Because of the prevailing pandemic and immediate need for COVID-19 tests, COA said processes for liquidating payments and other documentary needs were simplified to a bare minimum. The purpose of the streamlining was to hasten payments and avoid delays in RT-PCR testing.",,rappler,2022-08-23
"In the agreement, additional funds will only be released upon the submission of fully  case investigation forms (CIFs) duly signed by the person tested, and a summary of test results certified by the contractor’s pathologist submitted to the Department of Health (DOH) and the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.",,rappler,2022-08-23
"However, the auditor said: “Review of the sampled CIFs (case investigation forms) showed 100 percent remain either partially or not fully filled out. In the absence of the duly  CIFs, the Audit Team has no point of reference to verify the consistency of data provided in the CIF and line list.” ",,rappler,2022-08-23
"So far PhilHealth has paid the contractor P782.282 million for 265,490 RT-PCR tests administered from January 2020 to September 2021. The auditors said there were no duly  CIFs nor signed documents by the persons tested during this period.",,rappler,2022-08-23
"In its finding COA said: “It appears that both parties have fallen short in fulfilling their obligations over these claims as the Contractor submitted improperly  and unsigned CIFs, which PhilHealth willingly accepted despite their impropriety.” ",,rappler,2022-08-23
COA has tapped a special audit team to look into these transactions. This team will file a separate report. COA has also asked the Fraud Audit Office (FAO) to do  “a more in-depth investigation.”,,rappler,2022-08-23
"Because of the lack of documents, the auditors were stymied from determining the following: 1. If those tested were properly evaluated; 2. If indeed RT-PCR tests were performed; 3. If the persons tested were eligible according to the criteria set by the DOH; and 4, if these individuals consented to undergo the tests.",,rappler,2022-08-23
"Informed of the COA findings, PhilHealth said it sent a letter to the contractor last May 23, telling it  with the requirements by  CIFs. ",,rappler,2022-08-23

DOH expands 2nd COVID-19 booster shot to adults aged 50 and up,,rappler,2022-07-27
"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) has allowed adults aged 50 and above, and those  aged 18 to 49, to get their second COVID-19 booster shot.",,rappler,2022-07-27
"In a statement on Tuesday, July 26, the DOH said that the move is based on the  of the Health Technology Assessment Council to the agency. It added that only Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be used for them, and will be given fourth months after their first booster or third dose of the vaccine. ",,rappler,2022-07-27
"“As vaccine immunity wanes over time, we are dedicated to helping our people remain protected against COVID-19. We are making it easier for as many of our people to avail of the primary series and boosters – including second boosters,” DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said. ",,rappler,2022-07-27
The DOH said that eligible individuals can check the schedule of vaccine deployment with their local government units and private service providers.,,rappler,2022-07-27
"“As part of the preparation for the administration of second booster doses to the above-mentioned populations, orientations for local government units and vaccination centers are already scheduled,” the DOH said. ",,rappler,2022-07-27
"Prior to this development, the second booster shot was only limited to healthcare workers, senior citizens, and  individuals with specific medical conditions. ",,rappler,2022-07-27
The DOH said that eligible individuals need to bring their vaccination card and a valid ID. ,,rappler,2022-07-27
"“A medical certificate is not required, even for those  The medical screener or doctor at the vaccination site is authorized to assess and make the determination,” the agency added. ",,rappler,2022-07-27
The DOH decided to administer a second booster shot to the age groups as the country deals with a new surge in cases driven by Omicron offshoots. ,,rappler,2022-07-27

The promise – and limits – of Marcos’ SONA push to write off agrarian reform beneficiaries’ debt,,rappler,2022-07-26
"MANILA, Philippines – One of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s first legislative asks from Congress in his first State of the Nation Address (SONA) is a law that would free from debt farmers awarded lands by the government.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"Progressive groups  the policy direction, saying it should have been done long ago, but they also pointed out the limits of Marcos’ agrarian reform declarations. ",,rappler,2022-07-26
"Without a ban on land conversion, would the policy hasten the shrinking of agricultural lands by making it easier for agrarian reform beneficiaries to sell their land to entities who want to use the land  residential, or industrial purposes?",,rappler,2022-07-26
"“Congress must also pass a law that will emancipate the agrarian reform beneficiaries from the agrarian reform debt burden, thereby amending Section 26 of Republic Act 6657,” said Marcos on Monday, July 25, referring to the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"“In this law, the loans of agrarian reform beneficiaries with unpaid amortization and interest shall be condoned,” he added.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"As for agrarian reform beneficiaries who are yet to receive land under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), they will also be given the land sans any obligation to pay amortization, said the President. This amounts to free land distribution, something that progressive farmers’ groups have been asking for for decades.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"The condonation of the loans would involve P58 billion and benefit 654,000 agrarian reform beneficiaries, said Marcos. It would cover 1.18 million hectares of awarded lands.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"His eldest sister, Senator Imee Marcos, had also called for the writing off of unpaid loans in 2020 as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. She said back then that doing so would help farmers gain access to better loans, thus helping them make their lands more productive.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"“Condoning unpaid loans will give farmers fresh access to other government lending programs that will help them maintain, if not increase, their productivity amid the pandemic,” she said then.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"But while Congress is yet to pass the wish list law, President Marcos said he would go ahead and impose a one-year moratorium on agrarian reform beneficiaries’ payments of land amortization and interest.",,rappler,2022-07-26
Such a moratorium had been implemented by the Duterte administration in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and was one poverty-alleviating measure included in the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.,,rappler,2022-07-26
"“A moratorium will give the farmers the ability to channel their resources in developing their farms, maximizing their capacity to produce, and propel the growth of our economy,” said Marcos.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"The progressive group Kilusang Mambubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP), led by Duterte-time agrarian reform secretary Rafael Mariano, said the push for a debt condonation law and free land distribution was “long overdue.” But passing such a law is not enough.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"Free land distribution would cover only lands already acquired by the government from private entities, or government lands intended for or suitable for agriculture under a Duterte executive order. Because the CARP expired in 2014, the government no longer has the mandate to cover additional agricultural lands still in private hands.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"“The intent to distribute lands free of charge is ineffective at best and duplicitous at worst, in the absence of a new agrarian reform law that will allow the coverage of new private agricultural lands for distribution after CARP’s mandate to do so expired in 2014,” said Mariano.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"To KMP, Marcos is “absolving” private entities that would be free to acquire lands from agrarian reform beneficiaries, whether by buying it from them or taking the land by force.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"If Marcos was sincere in giving more lands to landless farmers, said Mariano, he would push for a new law that would extend government’s mandate to acquire more privately held agricultural lands and would impose a moratorium on land conversion.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"This halt in land conversion would address the problem of agrarian reform beneficiaries giving their land to private firms, which would then turn the agricultural land into subdivisions  developments.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"“The non-recognition of the problem of land use conversion defeats any declared support for agrarian reform. Without this, any farmer awarded any land faces the danger of eviction and conversion,” said Mariano.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"Jobert Pahilga, a lawyer with paralegal group Sentra, hopes Marcos “will be true to his words.”",,rappler,2022-07-26
But he echoed Mariano that there are more problems with the agrarian reform program that Marcos left unmentioned.,,rappler,2022-07-26
"“Condonation of debt would not be enough. The government should make an inventory of the lands awarded through [Presidential Decree] 27 and CARP as, at present, the farmer-beneficiaries are not in control and possession of the lands like in the case of Hacienda Tinang. The land awarded to farmers should be given back to them,” he said. ",,rappler,2022-07-26
"In Hacienda Tinang in Tarlac, farmer-beneficiaries of land have still not been able to possess and benefit from the awarded land because of contestations and disputes with another group, which includes Concepcion, Tarlac Mayor Noel Villanueva.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"However, debt condonation could also be a policy that makes it easier for agrarian reform beneficiaries to sell their awarded land. According to the law, a land beneficiary can sell their landholding after 10 years.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"Economist Raul Fabella, in a Business World column, had seen debt condonation as a type of economic stimulus measure. It would mean farmers would finally fully own the land and would be able to sell or lease their land for industrial-scale farming.",,rappler,2022-07-26
Fabella pointed to studies showing that consolidated tracts of agricultural land are much more productive and  than if they were tilled piecemeal by smallholder farmers with limited capital.,,rappler,2022-07-26
"“The beneficiaries  renters on top of having more stable employment in large farms,” said Fabella.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"But if farmers can easily sell their land to any private entity, there’s little stopping that private entity from converting the supposedly agricultural land for other purposes – unless Marcos also imposes a ban on land conversion. This would ensure that the landholding would be used for agricultural purposes. Without this ban, and with farmers free to sell their land, the country could see a shrinking of lands planted with crops, which is a threat to food security.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"This would be ironic, given Marcos’ repeated promises to prioritize food security and food affordability.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"But Marcos’ call on Congress to finally pass a National Land Use Act could be related. Versions of this measure, which has been languishing in the legislative chambers for two decades, intend to create a National Land Use Plan that would set aside specific areas in the country for agriculture and fisheries, conservation, residential development, and infrastructure.",,rappler,2022-07-26
But Mariano worries about versions of the National Land Use Act that would exclude agricultural lands.,,rappler,2022-07-26
"Under CARP, the government targeted to acquire and distribute 5.4 million hectares of land for landless farmers and farm workers. Of this, around 4.9 million hectares have been distributed.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"This means a balance of over 540,000 undistributed lands as of the end of the Duterte administration, according to former agrarian reform secretary John Castriciones in an August 2021 briefing with Duterte. Distributing land to landless farmers is a government policy aimed at social justice and empowering farmers who, as new land owners, would have the chance to independently make their own living from the land rather than be at the mercy of landowners.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"But without support, farmers lacking money have often been unable to put up the capital needed to make their land productive and end up selling their land or giving its control back to previous landowners. This is why, as Marcos himself acknowledged in his SONA, agrarian reform programs must also provide production support to the beneficiaries in the form of fertilizer, machines, pesticides and herbicides, and more.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"In 2019, then president Rodrigo Duterte issued an executive order hoping to add certain government lands to lands for distribution – government lands that have been devoted to or are suitable for agriculture and have not been used for the purpose they were bought.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"According to Marcos, there are 52,000 hectares of such land that he aims to distribute to landless war veterans, landless surviving spouse and orphans of war veterans, and landless military and police retirees.",,rappler,2022-07-26
These lands will also be given to landless persons with college degrees in agriculture.,,rappler,2022-07-26
"“The call of the times is for the infusion of fresh and new blood in the agricultural sector. We need a new breed of farmers equipped with modern agricultural technology able to engage in sustained scientific farming that will not only increase farm yields but also resilience in the face of climate change,” said Marcos in his SONA. ",,rappler,2022-07-26
The policy promises to address one long-festering problem in the country’s agriculture: the aging of farmers and a dearth of young people willing to work in the sector.,,rappler,2022-07-26
"By giving land to young people interested in agriculture, Marcos appears bent on giving them a leg-up so they won’t need to start from scratch.",,rappler,2022-07-26
"Many will no doubt be waiting for how and when Marcos will operationalize the directive. How can agriculture graduates sign up for free land? What conditions or qualifications apart from the degree will be imposed, if any? ",,rappler,2022-07-26
Ironies abound in Marcos’ debut State of the Nation Address,,rappler,2022-07-25
"MANILA, Philippines – In between the numerous plans and targets listed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in his debut State of the Nation Address, ironies concerning his family and his administration made these enumeration seem less attainable..",,rappler,2022-07-25
"During the panel discussion after the SONA, Rappler editor-at-large Marites Vitug pointed out the ironies or contradictions in Marcos’ speech, which was delivered on Monday, July 25.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"First, one of Marcos’ 19 priority bills is a National Government Rightsizing Program. But Vitug pointed out that he was also pushing for the creation of new offices.",,rappler,2022-07-25
Some of his priority bills include the establishment of a Medical Reserve Corps under the Health and Emergency Management Bureau of the Department of Health (DOH). He also wants to create a National Disease Prevention Management Authority attached to the DOH. ,,rappler,2022-07-25
"To add, Marcos also wants to establish the Virology Science and Technology Institute, attached to the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), and a Department of Water Resources as well.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Vitug also said that though Marcos talked about healthcare,  he did not mention the “very low” vaccination rates for boosters, and the nursing crisis in the Philippines.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Marcos said he has directed the DOH and the Department of the Interior and Local Government to “undertake another rollout of booster shots,” as preparation for the resumption of face-to-face classes.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"He earlier said wearing of masks would be optional if the COVID-19 booster rollout  “successful.” However, booster uptake remained low as of July 11, only at 21% of those fully vaccinated.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Vitug also said the President stressed the importance of science-based research, for sectors such as agriculture.  But to date he has not appointed secretaries yet for the Department of Science and Technology and the Department of Health. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"For one, Marcos said “investment in science and technology is imperative” so we can improve our natural disaster resiliency.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"“Maganda naman na nalatag niya itong priorities pero dapat meron nang (It’s nice that he laid down these priorities but there should be), somebody who will hit the ground running. I think it’s different when you’re just an acting officer-in-charge,” she said.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"So far, Maria Rosario Vergeire has been named officer-in-charge of the health department.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Finally, Vitug recalled the still-unresolved issue of Marcos’ P203-billion estate tax liability.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Marcos wants to adjust the tax system, including the imposition of value-added tax on digital service providers, and simplifying  procedures.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"“There’s an irony here, you know, improving the tax system, making it simple, but you know there’s this big question of our president not having paid the estate taxes of his family as well, which is amounting to billions of pesos,” Vitug said. ",,rappler,2022-07-25

"A moratorium will give the farmers the ability to channel their resources in developing their farms, maximizing their capacity to produce, and propel the growth of our economy.  [applause]",,rappler,2022-07-25
The civil society organizations also support this because it will unburden the farmers of their dues and be able to focus on improving farm productivity.,,rappler,2022-07-25

"Napakinabangan natin nang husto ang malalaking specialty hospitals gaya ng Heart Center, Lung Center, Children’s Hospital at National Kidney and Transplant Institute.

"We must ensure that our classrooms are safe for teachers, for students, and the entire  when they return to face-to-face classes.",,rappler,2022-07-25
We continue to encourage everyone to get their booster shots in preparation for the resumption of in-person classes. [applause],,rappler,2022-07-25
This is one of the reasons I have directed the Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to undertake another rollout of booster shots. [applause],,rappler,2022-07-25
"The condition and availability of school rooms for our students must also be addressed, again, in coordination with the Department of Public Works and Highways.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Though  have arisen over the question of repair of school buildings in relation to the Mandanas-Garcia ruling, this will be ironed out.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"We have been in discussion with local government leaders, Governors and Mayors, in the last few weeks to determine, with the LGUs, what is actually practicable, what functions belong to the LGUs and what belong to the National Government.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"There have also been lengthy discussions on the continuation and viability of the K to 12 school system. We are giving this a careful review, and all necessary inputs and points of view are now being considered.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"In the longer term, we are instituting a program of refresher courses and re-trainings for our teachers so they can stay abreast of the rapid growth in technology, especially in this post-pandemic world. [applause]",,rappler,2022-07-25
As for the ‘horror’ stories that we have heard about  the poor quality of educational materials and supplies that are being given to our schools – this must end! [applause],,rappler,2022-07-25
Our children must always be equipped with the best that we can provide.,,rappler,2022-07-25

"We must do better in the international rankings especially when  to the so-called STEM subjects:  Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
These skills and this knowledge are necessary for our young people to be able  in a highly technological  world.,,rappler,2022-07-25
The raw talent is there in our young people.  It is up to our educational system to develop and to refine that great pool of talent. [applause] ,,rappler,2022-07-25
Foreign employers have always favored Filipino employees because of  of the English language.  This is an advantage that we must continue to enjoy. ,,rappler,2022-07-25
"The internet has now  the global marketplace. Not only for goods services but also for ideas, even extending to our own personal interactions. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
The language of the internet – for better or for worse – is English. ,,rappler,2022-07-25

"On a related subject, we are entering an age of exponential adoption of technology. It is the Fourth Industrial Revolution. ",,rappler,2022-07-25

The scale and the speed at which these innovations are introduced universally into our everyday lives and activities is unprecedented in our recorded history. ,,rappler,2022-07-25
We cannot stand idly by. ,,rappler,2022-07-25
The mission of our Department of Information and Communications Technology is to identify and utilize these innovations to improve governance.,,rappler,2022-07-25
"It has the daunting task now of transforming our government into an agile bureaucracy that is responsive to the needs of the public, provide good and solid data to ensure informed decision-making, as well as allow secure and seamless access to public services. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
The voluminous records stored in the government warehouses and archives have to be digitized.  Those that are already stored in various inventories of data should be harmonized and shared across departments and agencies.,,rappler,2022-07-25
"Needless to say, these have to be kept in large data centers that are secure yet accessible.",,rappler,2022-07-25
The National ID will play an important part in this digital transformation. [applause],,rappler,2022-07-25
"For citizens to be able to seamlessly transact with government, their identity must be easily verifiable.",,rappler,2022-07-25
We expect to issue 30-million physical IDs and 20-million digital IDs by the end of this year.  [applause] The target is to  the issuance of about 92-million IDs by the middle of next year. ,,rappler,2022-07-25
"As the world moves into rapid digitalization, the digital divide will  more pronounced. The depth and breadth at which these technologies will be transformative in our lives is fully expected.",,rappler,2022-07-25

"Hence, universal connectivity will be a  in order to ensure that no citizen is left behind. [applause]",,rappler,2022-07-25
"I have therefore tasked the DICT to deploy digital connectivity across our various islands.

"The planned expansion of infrastructure projects, I believe, would be possible if we continue to encourage the participation of the private sector in the development of our programs.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Public Private Partnerships or PPPs hold great potential for that expansion, [applause] for infrastructure development and for innovation.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Our infrastructure development is of primary importance as it is a necessary element to improve many other sectors — to include agriculture, tourism, general economic activity, and even to governance. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
It is my belief also that we have missed some great opportunities to develop our rail transport system. ,,rappler,2022-07-25
It is clear in my mind that railways offer great potential as it continues to be the cheapest way of transporting goods and passengers.,,rappler,2022-07-25
We can build upon already existing lines by modernizing these old railway systems.,,rappler,2022-07-25
"There are dozens of railway projects – on the ground, above the ground, below ground, not just in Manila, but in other regions – at various stages of implementation, and with  cost of 1.9 trillion pesos. [applause]",,rappler,2022-07-25

A key sector in our transformation plans is that of energy.,,rappler,2022-07-25
"Another fundamental requirement for growth and increased employment will be the availability of cheap, reliable energy. This  under the category of “ease of doing business”.  If we are to attract investors, both local and foreign, to set up shop here in the Philippines.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"At present, our demand for energy far exceeds our reliable supply.  We must increase the level of energy production.  We must look at every possible option that would be appropriate for the Philippine situation. There is some room to expand our present power supply through existing power sources, but this is only to a very limited extent. We must build new power plants. [applause]  We must take advantage of all the best technology that is now available, especially in the areas of renewable energy. [applause]",,rappler,2022-07-25
Our search for new power sources should always be with an eye to improving the mix of the energy supply between traditional and renewable sources.,,rappler,2022-07-25
The technology on renewable energy is progressing rapidly. And many of these technologies are appropriate for the Philippines. We have already begun windmill power. We are now expanding very quickly our solar power production. ,,rappler,2022-07-25
"For both offshore and on-shore wind turbines, for example, the World Bank has calculated that there is the potential of 255 gigawatts  by the year of 2030. [applause]",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Solar power has steadily increased its efficiency in converting sunlight to electrical power, which is particularly attractive for the Philippines. Because unlike wind power, solar power is practical almost everywhere  in the Philippines all year round.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"In the move to lowering our carbon footprint caused by energy production, our advancement to renewables will have a lead time. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"In the interim, natural gas will hold the key. We will provide investment incentives by clarifying the uncertain policy in upstream gas, particularly  in the area close to Malampaya.",,rappler,2022-07-25
This requires clarification of the processes and review of service contracts policy.,,rappler,2022-07-25
I believe that it is time also to re-examine our strategy towards building nuclear power plants in the Philippines. [applause],,rappler,2022-07-25
"We  of course with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regulations for nuclear power plants as they have been strengthened after Fukushima.  In the area of nuclear power, there have been new technologies developed that allow smaller scale modular nuclear plants and other derivations thereof.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Once again, PPPs will play a part in support as funding in this period is limited.  [applause]",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Furthermore, we must examine the entire system  of transmission and distribution for the purpose of finding ways to lower the price of energy to the consumer and to industry.",,rappler,2022-07-25
We must expand the network of our transmission lines while examining schemes to improve the operation of our electrical cooperatives. All this in aid of reducing energy cost especially but not limited to households.  [applause],,rappler,2022-07-25
"All this impetus for development and growth, we undertake within the context of accelerating climate change and extreme weather conditions.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Though we are a minor contributor to climate change globally, we have the unfortunate distinction of being one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"For the welfare of our people, it is incumbent upon us to alleviate the effects of that vulnerability.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"The use of renewable energy is at the top of our climate agenda.  We will increase our use of renewable energy sources such as hydropower, geothermal power, solar, and wind. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Geographically, we are a disaster-prone country. Capacity building for our natural disaster resiliency is therefore a must.  Investment in science and technology is imperative to enable us to have accurate weather forecasts and on-time disaster alerts.",,rappler,2022-07-25
Studies show that already now many areas in the Philippines are at high risk from the rise in sea levels brought about by the increase in global temperature. We must adapt to this phenomenon with disaster-proof planning of  ,,rappler,2022-07-25
"We will also look into the precarious fresh water supply situation in the country, especially in our urban areas.  Many of our water supply systems date back to the 1950’s, and they must now be rehabilitated and improved.",,rappler,2022-07-25
"I have instructed the DENR together with the DPWH, to explore possible partnerships with the private sector to address this crucial situation. ",,rappler,2022-07-25

It is my belief also that we have missed some great opportunities to develop our rail transport system. ,,rappler,2022-07-25
It is clear in my mind that railways offer great potential as it continues to be the cheapest way of transporting goods and passengers.,,rappler,2022-07-25
We can build upon already existing lines by modernizing these old railway systems.,,rappler,2022-07-25

"At present, our demand for energy far exceeds our reliable supply.  We must increase the level of energy production.  We must look at every possible option that would be appropriate for the Philippine situation.

"In the move to lowering our carbon footprint caused by energy production, our advancement to renewables will have a lead time. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"In the interim, natural gas will hold the key. We will provide investment incentives by clarifying the uncertain policy in upstream gas, particularly  in the area close to Malampaya.",,rappler,2022-07-25
This requires clarification of the processes and review of service contracts policy.,,rappler,2022-07-25

"What you should know about Marcos’ first SONA: ‘Traditional,’ but protests at a distance",,rappler,2022-07-25
"MANILA, Philippines – When he spoke for the first time as president, Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. made a bold promise to the nation: “You will not be disappointed. So do not be afraid.”",,rappler,2022-07-25
"It was a heavy  from the second Marcos president, who entered Malacañang both with the promise of the first post-EDSA majority-win and the baggage and legacy of his father, who held the same post before him. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"A little over a month since Marcos took his oath, he addresses the nation again on Monday, July 25, this time with the 19th Congress as his primary audience. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"The 2022 State of the Nation Address (SONA) is not only Marcos’ first as president, it’ll also be the first time for Philippine legislators to gather in person at the Batasang Pambansa for a full face-to-face event since the pandemic began. The last two SONAs of former president Rodrigo Duterte were hybrid events, with only a small portion of legislators physically present. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"More importantly Marcos will, for the first time, expound on his plans for the country. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Despite a landslide win in the May 9, 2022 elections, Marcos and his Uniteam running mate Vice President Sara Duterte were generally sparse in the details of their platform and proposed programs. Their main campaign promise – as their coalition name suggests – was “unity.” ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"And while neither Marcos nor top officials in Malacañang have gone into the details of Marcos’ speech, the President’s first three Cabinet meetings and sole media conference have made it clear that at least three things are top of mind: food security, the economy, and the return to face-to-face classes, according to Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"At least two of the three priorities are directly under the supervision of the winning Uniteam tandem. Marcos, citing the need to “urgently address the looming food crisis,” is himself the agriculture chief. Vice President Duterte, daughter of the former president, will head the education department in its plan for the country to return to full face-to-face classes by November 2022. Earlier in July, Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno said the administration’s “Medium-Term Fiscal Framework” would be unveiled in full during the SONA. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
There are other major issues Marcos is expected – and needs – to address. The country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic is among the most urgent. ,,rappler,2022-07-25
"“With the face-to-face opening of  school year, it’s all about COVID response. And when we speak of COVID response, it’s not only about health. It goes all the way to the entire cycle of economy, not just health, you go to economy, you go into education, and so on and so forth,” said Rodriguez. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Health department officer-in-charge (OIC) Maria Rosario Vergeire had earlier announced a plan to change the structure of the country’s current pandemic task force, the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases. Vergeire, an undersecretary who also acted as spokesperson for the health department during the Duterte administration,  in as interim chief just as the World Health Organization declared monkeypox an “urgent global health emergency.” ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"The administration has also yet to expound its plans on other top issues in the country, such as the ongoing transition to the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, and the country’s plans for the environment and climate change. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
Marcos has also yet to explicitly say where his administration will go on the issue of his predecessor’s bloodiest legacies: the so-called “war on drugs.” ,,rappler,2022-07-25
"Speaking to media the Friday before the SONA, Rodriguez – who early on was the subject of resignation rumors – said Marcos himself will be writing his speech. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"“This [Friday] afternoon, he has devoted it, until the weekend, until morning of Monday (June 25) to finalize his SONA message,” said Rodriguez in an interview with select Palace reporters. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
Rodriguez also said that Marcos wants a “digitalized governance and digitalized PBBM administration.” “Rightsizing” has been another major buzzword in the first few weeks of the Marcos administration. ,,rappler,2022-07-25
"More than 1,300 guests are expected to attend the SONA in person, barring the off chance that they test positive for COVID-19. Former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, a member of Marcos’ administration coalition, is among those who will be skipping the event after testing positive for COVID weeks after she was first diagnosed. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Continuing a new practice that his predecessor started, Marcos’ SONA will be directed by an entertainment figure: director Paul Soriano, First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos’ nephew.",,rappler,2022-07-25
House Secretary General Mark Llandro Mendoza earlier said that the SONA would be “simple and very traditional.” ,,rappler,2022-07-25
"Tradition and history hang heavy in most of Marcos’ first engagements as president. His inauguration was held at the building that once housed the country’s legislature and where he, as a young boy, would wait for his father, the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos, to finish work. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"The tradition of delivering the SONA during the opening session of Congress on the fourth Monday of July started under the first president Marcos. He did so on June 12, 1978, according to the Official Gazette. That SONA was delivered six years after the older Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law on September 23, 1972. Months later, the late dictator padlocked Congress as it was due to begin session on January 22, 1973 – or when that year’s SONA was originally scheduled.  ",,rappler,2022-07-25
But this year’s SONA deviates in other ways from the ones that came before it. ,,rappler,2022-07-25
"For starters, over 20,000 police personnel will be deployed to secure both the immediate area surrounding the Batasang  in Quezon City, as well as Commonwealth Avenue, the road that leads to  ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"In contrast, only 10,000 police were deployed to secure the late president Benigno Aquino III’s first SONA. Marcos’ immediate predecessor Duterte deployed even less during his first SONA – only 6,720 police personnel manned the area. Activists have called the 2022 SONA deployment “overkill.” ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Officials have also deployed a “mobile jail” for “rowdy” protesters, according to an article posted on the government’s official site for the SONA. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Police had also barred protests along Commonwealth Avenue, although Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte later said the protesters will be allowed along Commonwealth Avenue (eastbound) up to the corner of Tandang Sora Avenue. This area still puts protesters a considerable distance away from the Batasang Pambansa. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"The strangest among the deviations, perhaps, is the House’s decision to not allow “wearing of clothes with political messages.” While some use the SONA as a chance to flaunt their tastes in fashion, progressive lawmakers usually show up making literal statements on major political and societal issues. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"Kabataan Representative Raoul Manuel said in a tweet: “This is the first time in recent history that an explicit prohibition is issued. Bawal ang protesta, bawal din ang mensahe sa damit kasi takot na takot sa art? Martial Law yaaarn?” ",,rappler,2022-07-25
(Protests aren’t allowed. Statements on clothing aren’t allowed because they are afraid of art? Is this Martial Law?) ,,rappler,2022-07-25
"In the morning, both chambers of Congress will open the first regular session of the19th Congress at the Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively. When session begins, each chamber will elect its new set of leaders. ",,rappler,2022-07-25
"In the Senate, Uniteam slate member Senator Juan Miguel Zubiri is set to be elected Senate President while in the House, Marcos’ cousin and Vice President Duterte’s co-campaign manager Leyte 1st District Representative Martin Romualdez is set to be House Speaker.",,rappler,2022-07-25
The President himself is expected to arrive at the Batasang Pambansa at 4 pm then deliver his SONA shortly after. The administration then has 30 days after SONA to submit its proposed budget for  year before Congress. ,,rappler,2022-07-25
"CHED chief De Vera, 3 other gov’t officials keep posts under Marcos",,rappler,2022-07-23
"MANILA, Philippines – Prospero de Vera III is keeping his post as chairperson of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. appointed him to the same role. ",,rappler,2022-07-23

"De Vera was appointed by former president Rodrigo Duterte in October 2018. Before that, he was CHED officer-in-charge for nearly nine months. ",,rappler,2022-07-23
He was designated as  in September 2016. ,,rappler,2022-07-23
"During his term under the Duterte administration, he had been criticized for his views on “flexible learning,” which was brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. ",,rappler,2022-07-23
"Among other controversies, he also traded barbs with the University of the Philippines over the removal of allegedly subversive materials from state university libraries.",,rappler,2022-07-23

Angeles also announced that Raphael “Popo” Lotilla had been appointed secretary of the Department of Energy (DOE) following a review of his eligibility for the post. ,,rappler,2022-07-23
"Lotilla is an independent director of Aboitiz Power and ENEXOR. According to the DOE charter, “no officer, external auditor, accountant, or legal counsel of any  or enterprise primarily engaged in energy industry shall be eligible for appointment as secretary within two years from retirement, resignation, or separation.”",,rappler,2022-07-23
"But the Department of Justice backed Lotilla’s nomination, saying an “independent director” is a novel concept not contemplated by the DOE charter. It deemed that an independent director is sui generis – or class of its own – in character.",,rappler,2022-07-23
"Meanwhile, Benny Antiporda has been chosen as acting administrator of the National Irrigation Administration. He will also be a member of its Board of Directors. Antiporda previously served as undersecretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.",,rappler,2022-07-23

"MANILA, Philippines – All eyes are on President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. as he is set to deliver his first State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday, July 25. ",,rappler,2022-07-22
"In his inaugural speech, Marcos said he hoped to build the country back from the pandemic by improving the public health system and attaining food sufficiency, among others. ",,rappler,2022-07-22
"Since entering Malacañang, the President has made headlines for delays in his Cabinet picks, parties at the Palace, and testing positive for COVID-19. ",,rappler,2022-07-22
"With preparations underway for this year’s SONA, Filipinos on social media shared their hopes and concerns ahead of the event. ",,rappler,2022-07-22
Rappler also asked social media users about the policies or issues they think President Marcos should prioritize in his first SONA.,,rappler,2022-07-22
"Many netizens said Marcos should talk about his economic plans, especially after the Philippines’ inflation rate jumped to 6.1% in June – the highest level since November 2018.",,rappler,2022-07-22
“Tapatin ang mga Pilipino. Ano ba talaga ang tunay na lagay ng [ekonomiya]? Paano haharapin ang [mamahalin na] pagkain?” one Facebook user said.,,rappler,2022-07-22
(Be honest to the Filipinos. What’s the true state of the economy? How will we face rising food prices?) ,,rappler,2022-07-22
Some users even hoped that Marcos would have a plan to fulfill his campaign promise of lowering the price of rice to P20 per kilo.,,rappler,2022-07-22
"Facebook user James T. Balbis said, “Sana ipatupad kasi sa [mga] katulad namin na mahihirap, malaking bagay ‘yung makakabili ka ng mura.”",,rappler,2022-07-22
"(I hope it would be implemented because for people like us who are poor, it would mean a lot to buy goods at a cheap price.)",,rappler,2022-07-22
German Aguirre said Marcos should focus on lowering fuel prices as it would create a “domino effect” on inflation and the prices of basic goods.,,rappler,2022-07-22
"According to data from the Department of Energy, as of Tuesday, July 19, local prices of gasoline and diesel have increased by P19.30 and P34.80 per liter, respectively, year-to-date. ",,rappler,2022-07-22
Others hoped that the President would also focus on bringing more jobs to Filipinos. The country’s unemployment rate went up to 6% in May. ,,rappler,2022-07-22
One user hoped Marcos would regularize contract of service employees in the government. ,,rappler,2022-07-22
These sentiments are consistent with the findings of a recent Pulse Asia survey that showed economic issues such as controlling inflation and reducing poverty were the most urgent concerns that should be prioritized by the Marcos administration.,,rappler,2022-07-22

Netizens also wished that Marcos would have plans to tackle the longstanding problem of corruption in the government.,,rappler,2022-07-22

"Meanwhile, Gloria Wilhelm said that if Marcos mentions unity in his SONA speech, he should prioritize freeing prisoners such as detained former senator Leila de Lima. ",,rappler,2022-07-22
"If he mentions 'unity' again, I expect him, to free Leila De Lima.",,rappler,2022-07-22
De Lima said in a separate tweet that Marcos should not forget the issue of human rights and criminal justice reform in his SONA speech. She also mentioned the problem of jail congestion as an issue that “calls out for urgent attention and action.”,,rappler,2022-07-22
"Huwag sanang kalimutan sa SONA ang usapin ng human rights and criminal justice reform, including prison reform. The sorry state of most of our jails and correctional facilities calls out for urgent attention and action.",,rappler,2022-07-22

"Some social media users, meanwhile, had something to say about the preparations for Marcos’ first SONA. ",,rappler,2022-07-22
"After the news broke that Paul Soriano would direct the SONA, some netizens questioned whether there was a need for a film director to direct the event. ",,rappler,2022-07-22

Why for Christ’s sake do we need a film director in a SONA? So it’s just for a show where everything is scripted. One thing for sure even the applause of the 31 M ghosts are orchestrated. It’s a proof that bbm’s goal and his family is just to enhance their lost image. ,,rappler,2022-07-22

"Do you know our strongest proof to say that Marcos Jr's mandate is a lie? Deploying 21,000 policemen and other officers on his 1st SONA. Not even Duterte did that. Not even his father (before martial law). THAT is how insecure of his power he really is. That is how afraid he is.",,rappler,2022-07-22

Rappler Talk: What Omicron BA.5 means for PH’s pandemic response,,rappler,
"MANILA, Philippines – COVID-19 cases in the Philippines are on the rise again. ",,rappler,
"Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire attributed the current increase in cases to the entry of Omicron subvariants, increased patterns of mobility, and the waning immunity due to the slow uptake of boosters. ",,rappler,
"The country has detected cases of BA.2.12, BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5. All of these Omicron offshoots are causing alarm due to a spike in cases worldwide. But of these subvariants, BA.5 is the most dominant subvariant in several regions.",,rappler,

DOH to shake up pandemic task force amid abolition calls,,rappler,2022-07-19
"MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) is set to shake up the structure of the Philippines’ pandemic task force, the IATF-EID, in the face of calls to abolish it even before President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took office.",,rappler,2022-07-19
"The DOH said it would be “reconstituting” the member agencies of the IATF-EID, or the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, to only retain those with “relevant and intended functions.” ",,rappler,2022-07-19
"The plan to reorganize the IATF was discussed by DOH officer-in-charge (OIC) Maria Rosario Vergeire during their Cabinet meeting with Marcos on Monday, July 18. ",,rappler,2022-07-19
"Experts have long called for the abolition of the IATF-EID, criticizing its disjointed structure. During the time of then-president Rodrigo Duterte, for example, the task force regularly consulted with mayors, businessmen, and doctors to produce a set of  only for Duterte to overturn them almost at whim.",,rappler,2022-07-19
"In 2021, lawmakers already urged Duterte to remove the members of the IATF and replace them with public health experts and business leaders. Duterte did not act on their appeals. ",,rappler,2022-07-19
"Vergeire said the DOH will also eventually replace the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF), the group in charge of implementing  by the IATF-EID. She said they will instead use as “platform” the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), the Philippines’ 12-year-old disaster agency.",,rappler,2022-07-19

Marcos also agreed to retain the COVID-19 alert level system for now even as he sought to reclassify restrictions that  with the current milder variants that infect patients.   ,,rappler,2022-07-19
"“To avoid confusion, we will retain the alert level system for now. We are however thinking, we are studying very closely, and  to a decision very soon as to decoupling the restrictions from the alert levels,” Vergeire said. ",,rappler,2022-07-19
Vaccination not required when schools shift to in-person classes,,rappler,2022-07-14
"MANILA, Philippines – In her first order as concurrent education secretary, Vice President Sara Duterte issued a strong order of mandating all schools in the country to return to face-to-face classes beginning November 2.",,rappler,2022-07-14
"There were no preconditions set for the return of students to the traditional mode of learning. They do not need to be vaccinated against the deadly virus that has so far infected over 3.7 million and killed 60,000 individuals in the Philippines. “There should be no segregation, no discrimination for the unvaccinated learners because vaccination is not mandatory and we don’t see any problem with co-mingling of students inside classroom. Because when outside, in their respective houses, in malls, in churches, and in public transportation, students are co-mingling whether vaccinated or not,” Duterte told reporters in an ambush interview on Thursday, July 14, in a mix of English and Filipino. ",,rappler,2022-07-14
"While the Philippines’ vaccination coverage reached over 60% of its 110-million population, only 9.6 million adolescents along with 3.7 million children have already been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. There were some 28 million basic education students enrolled in the recently concluded school year 2021 to 2022. ",,rappler,2022-07-14
"Aside from a no-vaccination requirement, there was also no class size set for each classroom. Duterte said that physical distancing will be implemented “whenever possible.”",,rappler,2022-07-14
"“Hindi po kami naglagay ng exact size ng class dahil iba-iba po ‘yung situation ng lahat ng mga schools natin. There are no schools na pare-pareho sila exactly sa kanilang classrooms and sa kanilang teacher,” she said. ",,rappler,2022-07-14
(We didn’t put the exact class size because every school is different. There are no the same schools in terms of classroom facility and number of teachers.),,rappler,2022-07-14
"Classroom shortages have been a problem even before the pandemic. A class of 50 to 60 students were packed into one classroom supposedly meant for a class of only 40. To make up for the lack of classrooms, class shifting had been implemented to  enrollees every year. (READ: Classroom shortages greet teachers, students in opening of classes)",,rappler,2022-07-14
"Though physical distancing will not enforced, Duterte said that the government would build more classrooms to address overcrowded classrooms. Asked how many classrooms they are targetting to build, Duterte said her office would look into it and release the data to the media later. ",,rappler,2022-07-14
"“Overpopulation naman is a matter of classroom construction. There is a backlog of classroom construction and gumagawa kami ngayon ng department order na, magstre-streamline ng requests ng construction ng classroom para naiiwasan natin ‘yung paglalagay ng projects na unimplementable (we’re drafting a department order that would streamline requests for classroom construction so we could prevent unimplementable projects),” the Vice President said. ",,rappler,2022-07-14
"Exemption from attending in-person classes can be given to “unwell” students or those diagnosed with COVID-19. “If the learner feels unwell, the learner can do blended mode of delivery,” Duterte said. ",,rappler,2022-07-14
"Duterte said that it was high time to resume to in-person classes because COVID-19 vaccines are already widely available. In February, the government began vaccinating kids aged 5 to 11. ",,rappler,2022-07-14
"“So wala na po tayong hihintayin (we’re not waiting for anything) with regard to this pandemic dahil ang sinabi po ng mga public health experts noon (because what public health experts said before was), ‘we need a vaccine.’ The vaccine is already here. Ang sabi po nila (They said), ‘we need the medicince.’ The medicine is already here,” she added. ",,rappler,2022-07-14
"Over two years into the pandemic, the Philippines is among the few countries in the world where schools have not fully opened for in-person classes. As of April 22, there were about 25,786 schools holding in-person classes.",,rappler,2022-07-14
"There are an estimated 60,000 public and private schools in the country.",,rappler,2022-07-14
There have been studies that showed students are “learning less” under the distance learning setup. Experts and lawmakers were alarmed by the learning losses brought by the pandemic. ,,rappler,2022-07-14
"Data from the World Bank said that the Philippines’ learning-adjusted years of school (LAYS) would be pushed back from 7.5 years pre-pandemic to 5.9 to 6.5 years, depending on the length of further school closures and the effectiveness of the remote learning setup.",,rappler,2022-07-14
"This means that while the Philippine basic education system offers 12 years of instruction, Filipino students show proficiency equivalent to only around six years spent in school.",,rappler,2022-07-14
"While it is high time for the Philippine schools to return to face-to-face classes, Duterte’s order drew criticism for supposedly lack of health protocols in place. ",,rappler,2022-07-14
"But for the Vice President, Filipinos are more than prepared now since it has been over two years since the pandemic began.",,rappler,2022-07-14
"“Kung makita ninyo ang difference sa ngayon is that mas madali na po and accepted na sa mga tao na magsuot ng mask. And alam na po nila ‘yung basic health protocols. Memorize na po natin lahat dahil two years po inulit ulit sa atin ang mga basic health protocols,” she said.

Why few Filipinos are taking COVID-19 booster shots,,rappler,2022-07-11
"MANILA, Philippines – In his first week as the chief executive of the country, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said that wearing of masks would be optional if the rollout of COVID-19 booster  “successful” and if the pandemic situation in the country is “good.”",,rappler,2022-07-11
"Marcos, who has yet to name his secretary of health, made this remark on Saturday, July 9, as he encouraged local government units to ramp up their vaccination targeting eligible students so they could safely return to school for in-person classes. (READ: Distance learning in the Philippines: A year of hits and misses) ",,rappler,2022-07-11
"While the Philippines’ vaccination coverage reached 91% of the target eligible population, booster uptake remained low at 21% of those fully vaccinated. ",,rappler,2022-07-11
"Before ramping up vaccination and booster uptake, the government must first address why there is a slow acceptance of booster shots in the country. ",,rappler,2022-07-11
"In a text message to Rappler on Monday, July 11, infectious disease specialist Dr. Rontgene Solante said that there was  among the public because relatively cases were going down in the past months, after the first Omicron surge in January. ",,rappler,2022-07-11
Solante said that people also tend to not fear COVID-19 due to the fact that Omicron variant is known to not cause severe infection. ,,rappler,2022-07-11
"“People believed that despite current increase in cases, getting the primary vaccine series is enough for them not to get the severe infection. And most of their experiences among they’ve known who got the infection and vaccinated, remained to have mild symptoms,” Solante added. ",,rappler,2022-07-11
"The same view was shared by Dr. John Wong of Epimetrics. He said that there was a high demand for vaccination late 2021 during the Delta wave. “The demand was driven by fear. The perception that they were susceptible and the disease was severe,” he said. ",,rappler,2022-07-11
"“Since mid-February 2022, when the first Omicron surge ended, demand has fallen because of the reverse perception. People’s fears of the vaccine’s side effects are now greater than their fear of the virus,” Wong said. ",,rappler,2022-07-11
Epimetrics is a public health research institution that helps the government make sense of the pandemic.,,rappler,2022-07-11
"But the issue on slow assimilation of boosters is not unique to the Philippines. In the United States, health officials and experts already raised the alarm of stalling booster vaccination as early as February. ",,rappler,2022-07-11
Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Professor Andy Pekosz in a CNN International article said that it seemed that most Americans considered boosters as “optional” or “something extra.”,,rappler,2022-07-11
"“It seems like people consider it something extra or something optional, as opposed to, it really is almost critical when  to Omicron infections,” he said. ",,rappler,2022-07-11
"Canadians also share the same experience as authorities mulled for a fourth shot of the vaccine. A local health news publication in Ontario, quoting a Canadian health official, said that the word booster is a “double-edged sword” and “mislead people to think it’s not necessary.”",,rappler,2022-07-11
"“We’re basically in a situation where people either don’t have the appetite for third doses anymore,” said another Canadian health official Peter Juni. ",,rappler,2022-07-11
"In the Philippines, Solante urged the government to make booster shots “mandatory” to increase protection among population. He explained that making it mandatory in such a way that the “third dose or booster dose is part of an updated vaccination status due to the mutations which affected effectiveness of vaccines.” (READ: EXPLAINER: Can PH government make COVID-19 vaccine mandatory?) ",,rappler,2022-07-11
"“So I think it’s high time that we need to mandate the booster vaccination to the general population. Kailangang mandatory na siguro para lang ma-increase natin ang (This needs to be mandatory so we could increase) protection, especially now we are preparing for the face to face classes in November and the workplaces are also open now,” Solante said at a televised press briefing on Monday. ",,rappler,2022-07-11
Solante said that low booster uptake could also be attributed to pandemic and vaccine fatigue. ,,rappler,2022-07-11
"“It’s Filipino nature that we lack that discipline to follow  especially about vaccinations, like with pneumococcal and flu vaccine, we have a very low uptake for years,” he said. ",,rappler,2022-07-11
"The move to endorse an additional shot for most adults had first been met with skepticism in early 2021, until more data emerged showing its need for certain high-risk populations. As Omircron offshoots are once again triggering surge in infections, boosters have gained urgency to prevent impact on the healthcare system and to keep infections at manageable level.  ",,rappler,2022-07-11
"“With the arrival of BA.4 and BA.5  and the waning immunity, surge is inevitable. That’s why we are here now. We are still low risk at the moment but we need to ramp up boosting so we can have face-to-face classes and speed up economic recovery,” former national task force adviser and health reform advocate Tony Leachon told Rappler. ",,rappler,2022-07-11
But how can the Philippines encourage more Filipinos to get their booster shots? Experts said it’s through proper and effective information drive. ,,rappler,2022-07-11
"Week one: The negatives, positives of President Marcos",,rappler,2022-07-10
"MANILA, Philippines – In his first speech as the 17th President of the Republic, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. made a promise: He’d “get it done.” ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"Touching – but not expounding on – his father, the late strongman Ferdinand Marcos’ memory, the second Marcos president added: “I once knew a man who saw what little had been achieved since independence, in a land of people with the greatest potential for achievement; and yet they were poor. But he got it done; sometimes with the needed support; sometimes without. So will it be with his son. You will get no excuses from me.”",,rappler,2022-07-10
"There is a lot on the line for President Marcos, the first majority-elected President in the post-EDSA Revolution era. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"First, the huge mandate for his win also means great expectations from a majority of Filipinos. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"Second, Marcos inherited a Philippines wildly different from his predecessor culturally but more urgently, economically. While the pandemic situation is not as dire as it was in 2020, the effects of over a year of lockdowns and other external factors – Russia’s war on Ukraine, among other things – has meant the economic crisis is top of mind for all Filipinos. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"Finally, there’s the legacy that’s both been a boon and bane for one Bongbong Marcos Jr. That he enters Malacañang as the son of the late dictator means he’s always had a steady army of loyalists but also that there’s a chunk of a population who – and rightly so – despair and reject the second rise of the Marcos name. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
How did the new president do in his first week? ,,rappler,2022-07-10
"Even as the pomp and pageantry of the inauguration grabbed most headlines on June 30, there were things that were glaringly not as well-ironed out. Upon assuming the post as the new president of the Philippines, Marcos was without key officials in his Cabinet: a foreign affairs secretary at a time when the global order continues to shift, a health secretary in the middle of a pandemic, an energy chief during an oil crisis, and chiefs of the science and technology, housing, and environment portfolios.",,rappler,2022-07-10
It would not be until July 1 when the Palace would announce that Marcos had finally picked a new Secretary of Foreign Affairs: the veteran diplomat Enrique Manalo. He was considered among Marcos’ best picks in his Cabinet. ,,rappler,2022-07-10
"Rappler news editor Paterno Esmaquel III noted that Manalo’s appointed was “significant” because “career diplomats, who underwent grueling exams and mastered diplomacy –  field that requires knowledge of history, politics, and international relations – have always wanted one of their own to lead the foreign service.” More recent picks to be the country’s chief diplomat alongside the President included businessmen and politicians. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"Marcos also did not convene his Cabinet until Tuesday, July 5 – and still, without heads of the health, energy, science and technology, environment, and housing portfolios, among others.  ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"Quick too was Marcos in restructuring the bureaucracy as he deemed fit. Executive Orders 1 and 2 focused on abolishing certain agencies, rearranging  structure, and streamlining staff support systems in the Palace. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"Most notable was his decision to abolish the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission, a (re)creation of former president Rodrigo Duterte. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"“[The PACC] is not in line with streamlining. First of all, its nature is investigative, which can also be conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman,” Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles would go on to explain in a press briefing on July 8, or more than a week after those EOs were released.  ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"Missing officials aside, the Marcos administration was clear on its priorities, even ahead of its first Cabinet meeting. The President himself had chosen to take over the agriculture portfolio – a risky and bold choice on his part, especially because of the gut issue that is hunger. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
Food insecurity has always been an issue in the Philippines and rising food costs have exacerbated that problem. The President and concurrent agriculture chief simplified his department’s mission: “But it really is just to ensure food supply in the Philippines at a price that is actually affordable.” ,,rappler,2022-07-10
"The first Cabinet meeting also spelled out his administration’s main priorities: getting the economy back on track, streamlining government, and going back to in-person classes. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"In his first Cabinet meeting on July 5, the first few minutes of which streamed on public broadcaster RTVM, Marcos declared that the economic team was going to brief the entire Cabinet before anything else. In a press conference the same day, Marcos said next to the economy and streamlining, they tackled the long-awaited return to face-to-face classes, an effort that would be spearheaded by the Education department under Vice President Sara Duterte. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
Most of Marcos’ discussion on the pandemic and on transportation – two other major issues in the Philippines – revolved around the eventual return to in-person classes. ,,rappler,2022-07-10
"Absent a health chief, Marcos met with officials of the health department, the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, and Philhealth to discuss vaccination plans. He also met with energy officials and the “Private Sector Advisory Council” for agriculture. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"On July 6, Marcos received China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi at Malacañang – the first official visit under the Marcos administration. The new president had earlier met with top diplomats and different countries’ heads of delegation for his inauguration. Wang  ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"On July 8, Malacañang hosted a gathering of mayors and governors to discuss the administration’s vaccine roll out plan in connection with the education department’s plans. Marcos himself was not able to attend that gathering in person, but we’ll get into that a little later. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"If by Monday and Tuesday, government programs and proposals were at top-of-mind, the weekend prior, it was images of at least two parties in Malacañang Palace that captivated social media. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"Images and details from the Inaugural Ball made their way to social media – videos of guests dancing and celebrating in Malacañang, and a souvenir medallion that bore the image of Ferdinand Romauldez Marcos Jr – stirred controversy online. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"It did not help that on July 2, the Palace again played host to the birthday of former first lady Imelda Marcos, the President’s mother and half of the so-called conjugal dictatorship during the first Marcos presidency. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles downplayed criticism of the Inaugural Ball, calling it “a joyful but simple and traditional occasion.” Senator Imee Marcos, the eldest sister of the President, said their gathering for Imelda Marcos was merely a “very simple merienda with a small recital of old friends and scholars.” ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"Addressing concerns that public funds would be used in private family functions, Angeles added: “We assure you that the President will adhere to law and so that is the presumption. We will… The President does – no directive in excess of anything that is written in the law.”",,rappler,2022-07-10
"That Marcos had to skip the Malacañang-hosted gathering of local chief executives wasn’t a matter of choice but government protocol. Early on July 8, Friday, Angeles announced that the Chief Executive had tested positive for COVID-19 during an antigen test. A subsequent RT-PCR examination confirmed that he had been reinfected with the coronavirus. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"All week, Marcos had been meeting with officials, administering oaths, and engaging in events, sans mask in several instances. His son, newbie Ilocos Norte 1st District Representative Ferdinand Alexander Marcos, had tested negative for COVID-19. The rest of the First Family – wife Liza and sons Simon and Vincent – were out of town, and had not been exposed to the President, according to Angeles. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
Testing positive for COVID-19 also meant Marcos had to skip at least one major event: the US embassy in the Philippines’ Independence Day celebration. ,,rappler,2022-07-10
"On Sunday, July 10, the Palace, quoting the President’s physician, said Marcos “is doing well and very much in stable condition.” Marcos has been isolating since testing positive for COVID-19, following protocols set by the health department. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"But even as he was isolating due to COVID-19, the President opened up the possibility of making mask-wearing optional should the conditions be ideal. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"“So let us return to the idea of what we did last year na magkaroon ulit ng vaccine rollout. Gawin na natin ito para makatiyak na tayo. At pagka maging matagumpay ang ating booster rollout ay makikita naman natin siguro puwede na nating ibaba ang mga alert level, puwede na nating gawing optional ang mask,” he said via teleconference during the July 8 meeting with local chief executives. ",,rappler,2022-07-10
"(So let us return to the idea of what we did last year, having a vaccine rollout. Let’s do this so we’re sure. If our booster rollout is successful, we can consider lowering alert levels and making masking optional.) ",,rappler,2022-07-10
President Marcos tests positive for COVID-19,,rappler,2022-07-08
"MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has tested positive for COVID-19, Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles said in a media briefing on Friday, July 8. ",,rappler,2022-07-08
"The President tested positive via an antigen test, said Angeles. ",,rappler,2022-07-08
"“The President has tested positive in an antigen test for COVID-19. He has a slight fever but he is otherwise okay,” said Angeles. ",,rappler,2022-07-08
"According to health department protocols, he is not required to take a confirmatory RT-PCR test but will instead need to isolate for seven days. ",,rappler,2022-07-08
"After seven days, should he be symptom-free, he can resume face-to-face activities, according to Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire. ",,rappler,2022-07-08
This is the second time Marcos has tested positive for COVID-19. ,,rappler,2022-07-08
"Ilocos Norte 1st District Representative Ferdinand Alexander “Sandro” Marcos, the President’s eldest son, tested negative via antigen test. The rest of the First Family – First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos and their two sons – are out of town and have not been exposed to the President, said Angeles. ",,rappler,2022-07-08
"Since Marcos tested positive, Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez attended morning briefings “on matters of security” instead. The President will also be skipping a US Embassy event to celebrate US independence but will virtually attend and address a leagues of governors and mayors meeting. ",,rappler,2022-07-08
"The entire week, Marcos has been attending meetings, briefings, and oath-takings of his appointees. Officials who’ve been working closely with the President – including Rodriguez and Angeles – tested negative for COVID-19 but will be monitoring any symptoms should they arise.",,rappler,2022-07-08
"“The President encourages the public to get their vaccine series and boosters,” said Angeles. ",,rappler,2022-07-08
‘It’s too controversial’: Charter change not a Senate priority for now,,rappler,2022-07-06
"MANILA, Philippines – Senators in the 19th Congress are not keen on tackling proposals to amend the 1987 Constitution, with  Senate president Juan Miguel Zubiri saying the chamber would rather focus on economic and health bills in the next 12 months. ",,rappler,2022-07-06
"Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, July 6, Zubiri said it was still too early to discuss charter change (Cha-Cha) at this point of the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ",,rappler,2022-07-06
He was reacting to the resolution filed by Pampanga 3rd District Representative Aurelio Gonzales Jr. in the House of Representatives which would amend the Constitution so that the Philippine president would have a five-year term and be allowed to be reelected once. ,,rappler,2022-07-06
The President is currently serving a six-year term with no reelection.,,rappler,2022-07-06
"“‘Wag na muna natin pag-usapan yung charter change, na kabago-bago pa lang ng administration. I think it’s too controversial,” said Zubiri, an ally of Marcos.",,rappler,2022-07-06
(Let’s not talk about charter change when the new administration has just started. I think it’s too controversial.),,rappler,2022-07-06
The presumptive Senate president said he’d rather the chamber focus on bills aiming to address the coronavirus pandemic and its impacts on the economy. ,,rappler,2022-07-06
"“‘Yun na muna yung pag-usapan natin kasi galing tayong pandemya, madaming nahihirapan na mga kababayan natin. Hindi pa tapos ang COVID-19, so we have to support the President in his, of course, health program sa darating na mga buwan…. I would say right now that’s (charter change) not our priority,” said Zubiri.",,rappler,2022-07-06
"(Let’s talk about these things first because  from a pandemic and many of our countrymen are still suffering. COVID-19 isn’t over yet, so we have to support the President in his, of course, health program in  months… I would say right now that’s not our priority.)",,rappler,2022-07-06
Other senators were also cold to the proposal to change the term limits for the sitting president. ,,rappler,2022-07-06
Senator Win Gatchalian has filed measures seeking to amend the economic provisions in the Constitution and to propose tandem voting for president and the vice president. ,,rappler,2022-07-06
"But he conceded now is not the time to talk about charter change, noting such an undertaking would eat up a lot of time in Senate and in the House. ",,rappler,2022-07-06
"“Right now my personal views on charter change is timing. With what is happening in our. Country in regards to inflation, in regards to the increasing prices of oil, may food security issue tayo – we should focus on these issues at hand,” Gatchalian told reporters. ",,rappler,2022-07-06
Senator Jinggoy Estrada said he is against “any and all moves to amend the term limits provision of the Constitution.”,,rappler,2022-07-06
"“While I have yet to read Cong. Gonzales’ proposed measure, I am sure that many will agree with me that not only is it premature, it is likely to be misconstrued as self-serving,” Estrada said in a statement. ",,rappler,2022-07-06
"Senator Aquilino Pimentel III, who is set to be the next minority leader, also rejected charter change for now. ",,rappler,2022-07-06
"“Hinay-hinay po tayo sa (Let’s slow down on) constitutional amendments. The problems we are facing as a people and as a society are not caused by the length of the terms of elective officials… Do not rush but start or re-start the discussion,” Pimentel said. ",,rappler,2022-07-06
This isn’t the first time for the Senate not to support charter change efforts led by their counterparts in the House.,,rappler,2022-07-06
"In the previous 17th and 18th Congress under the Duterte government, administration allies tried several times to change the Constitution –  overhauling it to shift to federalism, to just amending the economic provisions to ease restrictions on foreign investments. ",,rappler,2022-07-06
But senators were strongly opposed to changing the Constitution. They have repeatedly questioned the timing of the proposals and even said it could be “one big step into a quicksand.” ,,rappler,2022-07-06
Duterte ended his term as president in June 30 without fulfilling his campaign promise to shift to a federal system of government. ,,rappler,2022-07-06
"WATCH: Still no DOH chief, Marcos wants to  strengthen vaccination drive vs COVID-19",,rappler,2022-07-05
"MANILA, Philippines – In his first press briefing since he assumed office, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Tuesday, July 5, that he would “reinstitute” COVID-19 vaccination to fight Omicron offshoots that have been causing a surge in infections in the country. ",,rappler,2022-07-05
"“From the original variants, it was okay to have two shots but with Omicron, apparently we need a third dose, which is a booster dose. We will be encouraging that, especially for younger people because again, we have to be concerned about their return to school,” Marcos said.",,rappler,2022-07-05
"“That’s the general policy. We will reinstitute again the vaccination drive so we would be safer when the children go back to school,” he added. ",,rappler,2022-07-05

"“If we look at where we started, we still have the capability to handle the new COVID-19 cases, we should not look at the number of cases the same way we looked at them in 2020 and 2021, because this is Omicron. Omicron is very different. It is a little contagious but it doesn’t hit us very hard. In fact, the general experience is that people are down for like two to three days and that’s like flu,” Marcos said. ",,rappler,2022-07-05

"Below is Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s inaugural speech delivered on Thursday, June 30.",,rappler,2022-06-30
"His Excellency David Hurley, Governor-General of Australia, and First Lady Linda Hurley; their Excellencies, Special Envoys and Heads of Delegations; His Excellency Most Reverend Charles John Brown and the esteemed members of the Diplomatic Corps; Vice President Sara Duterte ; President Fidel Ramos; President Joseph Ejercito Estrada; President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo; Senate President Vicente Sotto III and the honorable members of the Philippine Senate; House Speaker Lord Allan Jay Velasco and the honorable members of the House of Representatives; Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo and the honorable justices of the Supreme Court; of course, First Lady Liza Araneta  and my children: Alexander, Sandro; Simon and Vincent ; I cannot proceed without a special greeting of course to the former First Lady Imelda Romualdez-Marcos; other distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemen; my friends; ang aking minamahal na mga kababayan; magandang tanghali po sa inyong lahat.",,rappler,2022-06-30
"This is a historic moment for us all. I feel it deep within me. You, the people, have spoken, and it is resounding. When my call for unity started to resonate with you, it did so because it echoed your yearnings, mirrored your sentiments, and expressed your hopes for family, for country, and for a better future. That is why it reverberated and amplified as it did, to deliver the biggest electoral mandate in the history of Philippine democracy. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"By your vote, you rejected the politics of division. I offended none of my rivals in this campaign.  I listened instead to what they were saying and I saw little  with my own ideas: about jobs, fair wages, personal safety; and national strength; and ending want in a land of plenty. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"I believe that if we but focus on the work at hand, and the work that  to hand, we will go very far under my watch. You believed that, too.  At pinakinggan ko ang tinig ninyo na ang sinisigaw ay “Pagkakaisa… Pagkakaisa… Pagkakaisa!” ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"We will go farther together, than against each other; pushing forward, not pulling each other back — out of fear, out of a misplaced sense of weakness. But we are the farthest from weak. The Filipino diaspora flourishes even in the most inhospitable climes, where they’re valued for their quality. The changes we seek will benefit all and will shortchange no one. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"I was not the instrument of change. You were that; you made it happen.  I am now. You picked me to be your servant, to enable changes to benefit all. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"I fully understand the gravity of the responsibility that you’ve put on my shoulders. I do not take it lightly but I am ready for the task.  I will need your help; I want to rely on it. But rest assured, I do not predicate success on the wide cooperation that’s needed. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"I will get it done. I once knew a man who saw what little had been achieved since independence, in a land of people with the greatest potential for achievement; and yet they were poor. But he got it done; sometimes with the needed support; sometimes without. So will it be with his son. You will get no excuses from me. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"I am here not to talk about the past; I am here to tell you about our future.  A future of sufficiency even plenty; of readily available ways and means to get done what needs doing — by you, by me. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
We do not look back but ahead; up the road that we must take to a place better than the one we lost in the pandemic: gains made and lost; opportunities missed; well-laid plans superseded by the pandemic. ,,rappler,2022-06-30
"Indeed, ours was the fastest-growing economy in ASEAN by ways now outdated. We shall be again by radical change in a way the world must now work to recover what we have lost in the fire. And move on from there.",,rappler,2022-06-30
"We face prospects of the spread of the war abroad, of which we are totally blameless. We seek friendship with all. But countries like ours will bear the brunt of it. And if the great powers draw the wrong lessons from the ongoing tragedy in Ukraine, the same dark prospect of conflict will spread to our part of the world. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"Yet there is more out there, like going forward by new ways of doing the pandemic forced us to adopt. A stronger resilience, quicker adaptability, they are our best prevention, they are our best protection. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"Quiet reflection in a rough and tumble campaign — of a breadth and intensity never experienced, revealed some of them. Such as a willingness to listen despite the noise; the hesitation to quarrel over differences; and to never, ever give up hope of reconciliation. These gave me the peace to ponder deeper. There are hints of a road not taken that could get us out of here quicker, to something better, something less fragile. There is also what you, the people did to cope. But this time empowered by new techniques and more resources. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"You got by; getting some of what you needed with a massive government help. And for this, I thank my predecessor for the courage of his hard decisions. But there is a way to put more means and choices in your hands. I trust the Filipino.   ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"Imagine how much more you’d achieve if government backstops instead of dictating your decisions. Always there to pick you up when you fall; giving what you need to get past a problem. Imagine if it invested in your self-empowerment to bring it closer to taking on whatever  Imagine, a country that, in almost every sense, is you. Now imagine what you and government can achieve together.",,rappler,2022-06-30
"We did it in the pandemic. We will do it again. But again, I will not predicate my promise to you on your cooperation. You have your own lives to live, your work to do — and there too I will help. Government will get as much done alone without requiring more from you. That is what government and public officials are for. No excuses; just deliver. It was like that, once upon a time. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"I did not talk much in this campaign; I did not bother to think of rebutting my rivals. Instead, I searched for promising approaches better than the usual solutions. I listened to you. I did not lecture you who has the biggest stake in our success. And the  State of the Nation will tell you exactly how we shall get this done. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"In this fresh chapter of our history, I extend my hand to all Filipinos. Come, let us put our shoulders to the wheel; and give that wheel a faster turn — to repair and to rebuild; and to address challenges in new ways; to provide what all Filipinos need; to be all that we can. We are here to repair a house divided; to make it whole and to stand strong again in the Bayanihan way, expressive of our nature as Filipinos.",,rappler,2022-06-30
"We shall seek, not scorn dialogue; listen respectfully to contrary views; be open to  from hard thinking and unsparing judgment. But always from us Filipinos. We can trust no one else when  to what is best for us. Past history has often proven that. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"Solutions from outside divided us; none deepened our understanding; they were always at our expense. Never forget we are Filipinos, one nation, one republic indivisible.  We resisted and never failed to defeat foreign attempts to break up our country in my father’s watch. His strongest critics have conceded that.",,rappler,2022-06-30
"So let us all be part of the solution that we choose; in that lies the power to get it done.  Always be open to differing views but ever united in our chosen goal. Never hesitating to change it, should it prove wanting. That is how agile, resilient republics are made. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"Our future we decide today. Yesterday cannot make that decision anymore, nor can tomorrow delay it. The sooner we start, the surer and quicker the prospect of achieving our future. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
These are troubling times; what’s happening to others can happen to us; but it will not. We see what’s happening. We are witness to how it is being stopped. And we have seen the glory that crowns struggle against all odds. Giving up is not an option. We’ve been through times of bitter division; but united we came through to this when it shall begin again. But better.,,rappler,2022-06-30
The campaigns I’ve run have taken me here where I stand today. I listened to you; and this is what I have heard. ,,rappler,2022-06-30
"We all want peace in our land. You and your children want a good chance at a better life; in a safer, more prosperous country. All that is within reach of a hardworking, warm, and giving race. Your dreams are mine; pangarap ‘nyo ay pangarap ko.  How can we make  true? How can we do it together? ",,rappler,2022-06-30
But I will take it as far as anyone with the same faith  can – as if it depended entirely on himself. ,,rappler,2022-06-30
"Sa pangarap na maging mapayapa ang ating bansa! Ang pangarap ‘nyo ay pangarap ko!  Sa pangarap na maging maunlad ang ating bansa! Ang pangarap ‘nyo ay pangarap ko!  At sa pangarap na maging mas masinang ang kinabukasan natin at ng ating mga anak, ang pangarap ‘nyo ay pangarap ko! ",,rappler,2022-06-30
We are presently drawing up  all-inclusive plan for economic transformation. We will build back better by doing things in the light of the experiences that we have had; both good and bad. It doesn’t matter. No looking back in anger or nostalgia. ,,rappler,2022-06-30
"In the road ahead, the immediate months will be rough; but I will walk that road with you. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
The pandemic ravaged bigger economies and ours. The virus is not the only thing to blame. What had been well built was torn down. We will build it back better.,,rappler,2022-06-30
"The role of agriculture cries for the urgent attention that its neglect and misdirection now demands. Food self-sufficiency has been the key promise of every administration. None but one delivered. There were inherent defects in the old ways and in recent ways, too. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"The trade policy  advantage made the case: that when  to food sufficiency, a country should not produce but import what other countries make more of and sell cheapest. Then came Ukraine. The most vulnerable when  to food are the countries farthest away from the conflict; those bearing no blame for provoking it. Yet they face the biggest risk of starvation. If financial aid is poured into them – though it never is, there is nothing to buy.",,rappler,2022-06-30
"Food is not just a  Without it, people weaken and die;  apart. It is more than a livelihood; it is an existential imperative and a moral one. An agriculture damaged and diminished by  will have a harder time, or will have no prospects at all, of recovering.",,rappler,2022-06-30
"Food sufficiency must get the preferential treatment the riches, free trade countries always gave their agricultural sectors. Their policy boils down to: don’t do as we do, do what we tell you to. I am giving that policy the most serious thought if it doesn’t change or make more allowances for emergencies with long term effects. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"There is a parallel problem in our energy supply; sufficient fossil fuel-free technology for whole economies has yet to be invented. And it is not seriously tried by rich countries. Again, consider the response of the richest countries to the war in Ukraine. But surely a Free World awash with oil can assure supplies. Or we will find a way. We are not far from oil and gas reserves that have already been developed.",,rappler,2022-06-30
"What we teach in our schools, the materials used, must be rethought. I am not talking about history. I’m talking about the basics, the sciences, sharpening theoretical aptitude and imparting vocational skills such as in the German example. Alongside the National Language; with equal emphasis and facility in a global language; which we had and lost. Let us give OFWs all the advantages we can for them to survive and to thrive.  ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"Our teachers from elementary up are our heroes fighting ignorance with poor paper weapons. We are condemning the future of our race to menial occupations abroad. Then they are exploited by traffickers. Once we had an education system that  generations for more and better jobs. There is hope for  Vice President and soon-to-be Secretary of Education, Sara Duterte-Carpio, will fit that mission to a T. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"We won’t be caught unprepared, under-equipped, and understaffed to fight the next pandemic. To start with, we never got over the pandemic of poor if any free public health. The last major upgrade of a public health system, exemplified by the resources poured into PGH, predates the current shambles by three generations.",,rappler,2022-06-30
"Our nurses are the best in the world. They acquitted themselves with the highest distinction abroad, having suffered even the highest casualties. With the same exemplary dedication at home they just got by. They are out there because we cannot pay them for the same risk and workload that we have back here. There will be changes starting tomorrow. I am confident because I have an Ople in my Cabinet.  There were  in the COVID response; we will fix them – out in the open. No more secrets in public health. Remember, I speak from experience, I was among the first to get COVID; it was not a walk in the park.",,rappler,2022-06-30
"My father built more and better roads, produced more rice than all administrations before his. President Rodrigo Roa Duterte built more and better than all the administrations succeeding my father’s.  ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"Much has been built and so well, that the economic dogma of dispersing industry to develop the least likely places has been upturned; development was brought to them. Investors are now setting up industries along the promising routes built. And yet the potential of this country is not exhausted. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"Following these giant steps, we will continue to build. I  on schedule the projects that have been started. I am not interested in taking credit; I want to build on success that’s already happening. We will be presenting the public with  infrastructure plan. Six years could be just about enough time. No part of our country will be neglected. Progress will be made wherever there are Filipinos, so no investment is wasted. The recovery of Philippine tourism, with its emphasis on accessing nature’s beauty, I am sure, will exceed expectations.",,rappler,2022-06-30
"And bigger is not always better; but there is something to be said for economies of scale. And yet the country invites investments in fast rising industries with quick returns – and inflicts irreparable damage for future generations. We have yet to see large-scale practical solutions to pollution. Though some are beginning to emerge. But there are tried and proven new ways of mitigation. Blades have been turning over the sand dunes of Ilocos Norte, harnessing a power all around but unseen, long before this day. I built them. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"The rich world talks a great deal but does a lot less about it than those with much less, but who suffer more death and destruction from climate change and lack of adaptation.",,rappler,2022-06-30
"We will look to our partners and friends to help the Philippines, who, despite having a very small carbon footprint, is at the highest risk. First, spare victims; then help them recover; and move on to lessen the harmful impact of climate change. We too have our part to play; we are the third biggest plastics polluter in the world. But we won’t shirk from that responsibility; we will clean up.",,rappler,2022-06-30
You will not be disappointed. So do not be afraid. ,,rappler,2022-06-30
"With every difficult decision that I must make, I will keep foremost in my heart and in my mind, the debt of gratitude I owe you for the honor and responsibility that you have conferred on me. ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"Whatever is in a person to make changes for the better of others, I lay before you now in  I will try to spare you; you have your other responsibilities to carry. But I will not spare myself – from shedding the last bead of sweat or giving the last ounce of courage and sacrifice.  ",,rappler,2022-06-30
"And if you ask me why I am so confident of the future, I will answer you, simply that I have 110 million reasons to start with. Such is my faith in the Filipino.  Believe, have hope: the sun also rises like it did today; and as it will tomorrow. And as surely as that, we will achieve the country all Filipinos deserve. God bless the Philippines, God bless our work. ",,rappler,2022-06-30

"“[I feel] happy! Siya man jud ang amohang gusto nga mahimog vice president (She’s who we wanted to be vice president),” Nanette said. The sentiment is echoed in other parts of the city – glee over their mayor and their vice president finally taking her oath. ",,rappler,2022-06-19
"Bangkerohan is just a few blocks away from San Pedro Square, where Duterte, the vice president-elect, took her oath of office. While Nanette did not attend the event itself – she had fruits to sell and a stall to keep watch over – its significance certainly wasn’t lost on her.",,rappler,2022-06-19
"It was the first inauguration to be held outside Luzon since 2004, when former president and Duterte ally Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo took her oath in Cebu province, which turned out big for her in the presidential race. Arroyo’s Cebu inauguration was the first ever to take place outside Luzon, where the country’s capital is located. ",,rappler,2022-06-19

Duterte was reportedly disappointed at his daughter’s decision to settle for vice president. Sara was always coy when asked about her relationship with her father during the campaign. Their rocky relationship was no secret.",,rappler,2022-06-19

"In the Philippine launch of the 2022 State of World Population (SWOP) report, the PopCom mentioned a 2020 report from the University of the Philippines Population Institute (UPPI) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) that anticipated an increase in unintended pregnancies by 751,000 in 2020 if there were no family planning services available during a total lockdown in the country for 9.5 months.",,rappler,2022-06-08

Still, the case took two years, and the San Roque 21 endured trial even when other similar cases were being junked by different courts and prosecutors because of the law being broad.",,rappler,2022-06-07

A young law, passed by Duterte only in 2018 to authorize the health secretary to declare epidemics, RA 11332 was used for various protocol lapses under the clause “non-cooperation.” Cases eventually failed as in the case of Senator Koko Pimentel who went to the hospital to  his wife even while still awaiting the results of his COVID-19 test. He later learned he was positive while he was already inside the hospital.",,rappler,2022-06-07
"For the San Roque 21, the judge said: “While others simply lined up in groceries and supermarkets to get food during Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ), the accused in these cases, unfortunately were constrained to publicly plea and beg for food. Clearly, the accused’s attempt and effort to secure food at the start of the ECQ is not covered by Section 9(e) of RA 11332.”",,rappler,2022-06-07

Marcos to take oath as president in National Museum,,rappler,2022-06-02
"MANILA, Philippines – Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. will take his oath as the 17th president of the Philippines at the National Museum premises on June 30, his camp said Thursday, June 2. ",,rappler,2022-06-02
"It’s unclear whether the oath-taking will be held indoors or outdoors, but according to  Presidential Management Staff Secretary Naida Angping, “the building and its surrounding areas match our requirements for President-elect Marcos’ inauguration.”",,rappler,2022-06-02
"“Preparations are already in full swing to ensure that it will be ready by then,” said Angping.",,rappler,2022-06-02
"Marcos was elected by 31 million people or an overwhelming 58% of the votes, the first majority president to be elected in the country.",,rappler,2022-06-02
"The National Museum, located in the heart of Manila, has a picturesque white neoclassical facade with a flagpole at the center. The driveway and entrance to the museum is elevated.",,rappler,2022-06-02
The Marcos camp in a press release called it as a “historic venue.”,,rappler,2022-06-02
"“Formerly known as the Old Legislative Building, it has served as the venue for the inauguration of former Presidents Manuel L. Quezon (1935), Jose P. Laurel (1943), and Manuel Roxas (1946),” said the Marcos press release.",,rappler,2022-06-02
"Bongbong Marcos’ father, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, presided over the Senate as Senate president in the same building.",,rappler,2022-06-02
"But when the elder Marcos won a second presidential term in 1969, it’s also where protesters trooped to oppose his leadership, marking the start of the First Quarter Storm or a period of civil unrest in the country.",,rappler,2022-06-02
"A massive student rally surrounded the old legislative building on January 26, 1970, the same facade which could see the son take his oath on June 30.",,rappler,2022-06-02
"The National Museum, the old Legislative Building, was the venue of a massive protest in 1970 led by the likes of Edgar Jopson triggering the First Quarter Storm and led to the proclamation of martial law in 1972.Photo from Benjamin Pimentel’s “Life and Struggle of Edgar Jopson” ",,rappler,2022-06-02
"The First Quarter Storm eventually led to Marcos proclaiming Martial Law in 1972, a dark era for the Philippines, but which the family had tried to rebrand as a golden age as part of a campaign to return to power. He abolished Congress through the 1973 Constitution, a railroaded charter that was upheld by the Supreme Court in a decision still blamed today for enabling the repressive dictatorship.",,rappler,2022-06-02
"If Marcos Jr. were to be inaugurated in the old session hall indoors, it would still be in the shadow of its history being padlocked in 1973 when his father abolished Congress.",,rappler,2022-06-02
"When Marcos Sr passed 1973 Constitution, opposition went to Congress – now National Museum – & found it locked. Two months later, Supreme Court in Javellana vs ES upheld 1973 Consti, blamed until today for enabling the repressive rule.📸 Official Gazette ",,rappler,2022-06-02
"The first plan was for Marcos to take his oath at the Quirino Grandstand, the same venue as the dictator’s inauguration. But the area still houses several COVID-19 field hospitals.",,rappler,2022-06-02
"“The safety and welfare of our people are paramount. As such, we chose to avoid disrupting the medical care being given to the COVID-19 patients housed there. That’s why we opted for the National Museum as the venue,” Angping said.",,rappler,2022-06-02
"Usually, Supreme Court justices administer the oath of presidents –  Bienvenido Reyes for Rodrigo Duterte, Conchita Carpio Morales for Benigno “Noynoy” Aquino III, Hilario Davide for Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo post-EDSA II.",,rappler,2022-06-02

Our Senate as the other half of the Congress of the Philippines began to exist in 1916, such that not many years ago we celebrated our centenary. By the way, there is only one family name that existed in the 1916 Senate and the 2016 Senate: Sotto, my grand uncle Filemon Sotto in 1916 and yours truly, Vicente Sotto, in 2016. The first Senate President was the late great President of the Commonwealth Manuel Luis Quezon, who so dominated the political era and is today remembered as a province and a city, that his memory never fades from our people’s consciousness. He was followed by more than 20 others whose names evoke memories of political astuteness, brilliance of mind and urbanity of behavior. I do not claim nor aspire for the same accolades. It is enough for me to have been your friend these many years, a builder of consensus if arguments stand in the way, a harmonizer should there be discordant notes.

Gordon takes jab at senators for refusing to sign draft report on Pharmally probe,,rappler,2022-06-01
"MANILA, Philippines – Senate blue  chairman Richard Goordon took a swipe against his colleagues for refusing to sign the draft panel report on the anomalies hounding the multibillion-peso pandemic contracts of President Rodrigo Duterte’s government.",,rappler,2022-06-01
"Gordon delivered a privilege speech late Tuesday night, May 31, in what is seen as his last-ditch effort to get more  blue  members to sign the draft report on the Senate panel’s probe into the deals cornered by the notorious Pharmally Pharmaceutical Corporation during the coronavirus pandemic. ",,rappler,2022-06-01
Gordon told his colleagues that they “cannot shirk from our responsibilities” by refusing to sign the  report.,,rappler,2022-06-01
"“The Senate’s full disclosure of the Pharmally plunder controversy achieves closure for our people. I am doing this as a chairman in a quandary. I respect my fellow members. I do not try to antagonize them or badmouth them. I respect the Filipino people,”  said Gordon.",,rappler,2022-06-01
"“The people of this country should not be denied the judgement or at least a debate whether there was malfeasance, misfeasance or nonfeasance…. The acts done in Pharmally were done with impunity,” he added. ",,rappler,2022-06-01

The blue  members who have signed the draft report are the following:,,rappler,2022-06-01

The other senators who have yet to affix their signature include:,,rappler,2022-06-01

"“It is not certainly a waste of time because even if  report will be supported by the majority, then we exposed the anomalies, which I am sure has put people on notice that these should not be repeated,” Drilon said. ",,rappler,2022-06-01
"Drilon said that in case the Senate adjourns session on Wednesday without  report on the Pharmally probe being filed, a senator in the next Congress may file a new resolution seeking a probe into the issue, then the new batch of senators may choose to adopt the same findings.",,rappler,2022-06-01
"The Senate blue  hearings uncovered that Pharmally cornered P10 billion in pandemic deals between 2020 and 2021 even if it was a small, newly created firm that lacked the funds, track record, and credibility to handle big-ticket government procurement. ",,rappler,2022-06-01

The report also questioned Nueva Ecija’s  procurement of P18.205 million worth of self-learning modules (SLM) for the first quarter of school year 2021-2022 for Grades 4 to 12 learners. The modules were only delivered near the end of the academic period.,,rappler,2022-05-30

"Like his performance in the CNN Philippines debate on February 26, Pangilinan stayed on-brand and consistent as he occasionally circled back to his top advocacy: agriculture and the rights of farmers and fisherfolk.",,rappler,2022-03-20
"“Tututukan natin ang tulong at suporta sa ating mga magsasaka at mangingisda dahil kapag…ang tulong ay buo, dadami ang kanilang ani, dadami ang huli, dadami na rin ang suplay ng pagkain sa ating mga merkado. Bababa na ang presyo ng pagkain at mawawala na ang matinding gutom,” Pangilinan said as he explained his expertise he believes would aid the president should he win.",,rappler,2022-03-20
"(We will focus on the help and support for our farmers and fisherfolk because if we help them fully, their harvest and catch will increase, and there will be more food supply in the market. Food prices will go down, and extreme hunger will be eradicated.)",,rappler,2022-03-20
"“Nawa’y (May) the last man standing [be] a farmer,” Pangilinan said in his final word, an apparent reference to Robredo’s closing statement in the Comelec presidential debate the day before: “The best man for the job is a woman.”",,rappler,2022-03-20
"Several questions asked at the Comelec debate required the candidates’ understanding of the role and mandate of the vice president. Asked whether the 1987 Constitution should be amended to enhance the responsibilities of the position, Pangilinan said the Constitution was sufficient when  to the powers it gives to the vice president.",,rappler,2022-03-20

"Like what Robredo did in her own debates, Pangilinan cited the Office of the Vice President’s (OVP) various COVID-19 projects, such as the production of personal protective equipment sets, a free shuttle service for health frontliners, and a teleconsult service called Bayanihan E-Konsulta. Robredo’s OVP was able to execute these despite its limited mandate and budget.",,rappler,2022-03-20

"The senator claimed that the Department of Health’s (DOH) budget was scrapped of P10 billion in 2019, which is why the country was “unprepared” when the virus struck. What he didn’t mention, however, was how this was eventually increased in the approved 2020 General Appropriations Act or the national budget after deliberations in Congress.",,rappler,2022-03-20
"Pangilinan also claimed that the Senate asked for higher budgets in Bayanihan 1 and 2, but these were not granted because the executive department did not know where to get the funds for it.",,rappler,2022-03-20
"Then, in August 2021, the COA found that the DOH failed to spend P59 billion of its 2020 budget.",,rappler,2022-03-20
"“At nakita naman natin [sa] huli, hindi rin pala nagastos. So talagang ayaw nilang malaki, pero ‘yong meron, hindi rin nagastos. So talagang in the end, dapat good governance…. Hindi  ang in charge,” he said. (And we saw in the end that it was not even spent. They did not want a large allocation, but even the funds given to them were not spent. So really, in the end, there must be good governance. We shouldn’t let  people be in charge.)",,rappler,2022-03-20
"In 2020, Pangilinan was one of the senators who called for the resignation of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III over lapses in his handling of the pandemic response. This was also the reason why Pangilinan became the only dissenting senator to the passage of Bayanihan 2 – because he did not want to pour more funds into the DOH without a change in leadership.",,rappler,2022-03-20
"During the debate, Pangilinan also showed off figures from his senatorial work that he  to memory. When candidates were asked about their thoughts on the P200 monthly subsidy for poor households amid fuel price hikes, Pangilinan first said that he was for suspending excise taxes on fuel and then called on the government to release the P500-million fuel subsidy for farmers and fisherfolk.",,rappler,2022-03-20
He also called for the release of an additional P6-billion fuel subsidy in unprogrammed funds.,,rappler,2022-03-20

Socialist professor Walden Bello challenged Pangilinan on no less than his advocacy for farmers because of his abstention on the rice tariffication law.,,rappler,2022-03-20
"“How can you say that you are an advocate of the farmers when you abstained on the biggest law that would affect the farmers of the decade, ‘yung (the) Rice Tariffication Act. He abstained. Did you go to the CR when that happened?” asked Bello.",,rappler,2022-03-20
"Pangilinan remained calm as he explained he made the abstention due to “reservations.” He said that the law had since been amended to give cash subsidies to rice farmers. He added that the law’s  the Senate to later push for the Sagip Saka Act, which allowed the government to directly buy agricultural and fisheries products from local farmer and fisherfolk enterprises.",,rappler,2022-03-20
"“That’s precisely why we pushed for that because we knew all the impact of the rice tariffication measure. So I beg to disagree with his view that we are crazy or we do not know or we’re not aware of the implications of the rice tariffication measure,” Pangilinan said.",,rappler,2022-03-20
"Unconvinced, Bello said Pangilinan should have opposed it, as it was “imposed” by the World Trade Organization. Pangilinan responded by saying, “Let us learn to agree to disagree with respect.”",,rappler,2022-03-20
Pangilinan joined his fellow candidates in criticizing the absence of Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte in Sunday’s debate and her standard-bearer Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s general snubbing of debates and fora of legitimate media.,,rappler,2022-03-20
"The senator likened the campaign to a courtship. “Alam mo, kaming mga kandidato, lumiligaw kami. Nililigawan namin ang botante. Pagka lumiligaw, dapat humaharap,” he said. (Candidates are like suitors. We are courting the voters. Suitors must show up.)",,rappler,2022-03-20

"“Kapag kayo ay binato, pinahiya, binatikos, cinancel, binoycott dahil tumulong kayo, sumuporta kayo, nangampanya kayo, at nagpakita kayo ng pagmamahal sa pamilyang Duterte, sabi ng Bibliya ay…batuhin ng burger. Maging mabait tayo sa mga tao na hindi sumusuporta sa atin.

"The “burger story” is one that Sara’s been turning to in the second month of the campaign. It usually caps her stump speech and begins with her referencing the Bible and the saying that if someone throws a stone at you, you must retaliate by throwing bread. The line is actually not from the Bible but is a popular Filipino saying or salawikain: “Kapag binato ka ng bato, batuhin mo ng tinapay.”",,rappler,2022-03-16
"But ironically, critics of the Dutertes, especially those of Sara’s father, President Rodrigo Duterte, are seldom recipients of kindness – if any at all. Critics – in politics, civil society, and media – have been harassed or attacked in the past. ",,rappler,2022-03-16
"Sara’s campaign speeches aren’t typically long, running for a maximum of 15 minutes most of the time. In her speech, she usually lays out what she says are the Filipinos’ main concerns: job creation following the COVID-19 pandemic, education, and peace and security. Duterte has said lockdowns should no longer be implemented and alert levels should be removed since the country already has a steady supply of masks and vaccines, and because anti-virals like molnupiravir are already available. ",,rappler,2022-03-16

"The government’s coronavirus task force set the bar for placing areas under Alert Level 1 by setting thresholds in the number of infections, hospital beds occupied, as well as vaccination coverage among the general population and vulnerable groups like the elderly.

Some experts have raised concerns over the potential shift to Alert Level 1.

"MANILA, Philippines – Seeking to usher in a “new normal,” government coronavirus task force officials directed local government units to ensure that at least 80% of senior citizens and 70% of the general population in  had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, citing the metrics among thresholds that need to be met to deescalate an area to Alert Level 1. ",,rappler,2022-02-22
"Health secretary Francisco Duque III and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. announced the government’s additional requirements to further relax quarantine measures in a televised meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte aired on Monday night, February 21. ",,rappler,2022-02-22
"Duque said National Task Force Against COVID-19 deputy implementer Vince Dizon had suggested adding vaccination metrics specific to the elderly population, as well as persons  among parameters that should be considered when assessing whether an area is ready to transition to looser restrictions. ",,rappler,2022-02-22
"“Kung hindi po sila ay makarating diyan po sa panukatan na iyan ay hindi po natin sila puwedeng ibaba to Alert Level 1 (If they haven’t met these metrics yet, then they cannot go down to Alert Level 1),” Duque said. ",,rappler,2022-02-22
"Weeks before additional vaccination thresholds were announced, pandemic officials had only mentioned “high” vaccination rates, along with low bed occupancy levels in hospitals, and low transmission of the virus was needed to lower quarantine restrictions  ",,rappler,2022-02-22
"But vaccination thresholds set at 80% of the elderly population and at least 70% for the general population are not nearly enough to protect health systems against the weight of future surges, said epidemiologist Dr. John Wong of public health research firm EpiMetrics. ",,rappler,2022-02-22
"“Since herd immunity is no longer possible because of breakthrough infections, the target should be 100% to protect each Filipino, especially the elderly and persons  Wong told Rappler. ",,rappler,2022-02-22

"Galvez framed the government’s move to factor in vaccination levels for specific populations as a “way forward” in the country’s fight against COVID-19. Despite being among the the first groups to  eligible for vaccines in early 2021, vaccination rates among the elderly have been sluggish in recent months with only 65% of seniors protected as of February 2022. ",,rappler,2022-02-22

"Solante continued: “Being a heavily mutated variant, the protection we got with  two dose[s] is not enough to protect us against the omicron [variant]. Adding a booster dose retained our protection against Omicron, more so if it’s BA.2,” referring to the more contagious version of Omicron. ",,rappler,2022-02-22
"On Monday night, Galvez said the rollout of boosters have been slow since the general population became eligible in December 2021. Roughly 9.7 million Filipino adults have received boosters as of February 22, while the government is targeting to administer 72.16 million additional doses.",,rappler,2022-02-22

"MANILA, Philippines – When Nona Andaya first met Ferdinand Castillo, it was love at first sight – even if, at that time, neither of them would admit that it was. ",,rappler,2022-02-14
"It was 1982. Nona was graduating from university and Ferdinand had just shifted to another course. Apart from their studies, there was also another, bigger priority. ",,rappler,2022-02-14
"“We were also busy with helping topple a dictatorship, so love was not a priority at that time,” Nona told Rappler. ",,rappler,2022-02-14
Determined as they were — to topple a dictatorship and to resist romance — love managed to find a way. ,,rappler,2022-02-14
"Over 30 years later, their work is far from over. Ferdinand was arrested on February 12, 2017 for murder, frustrated murder, and illegal possession of firearms – charges which Nona, Ferdinand, and human rights defenders say are trumped up. The allegations against Ferdinand, branded a “high-ranking member” of the New People’s Army by police and military, are what many activists face upon arrest. ",,rappler,2022-02-14

"Still, Nona manages to find hope — that one day, they’d reunite to “spend their senior years in peace and health.” She wants nothing more than for her and Ferdinand, whom she credits for saving her life, to “do what [they] love best — to serve [their] country as true iskolar ng bayan (scholars of the nation).”",,rappler,2022-02-14

"We both admitted to each other that it was love at first sight much, much later. When we met, it was not easy to shake off our determination not to get into a relationship due to our personal circumstances (I was busy with my academic requirements because I was about to graduate from college, and he shifted to another course). We were also busy with helping topple a dictatorship, so love was not a priority at that time. ",,rappler,2022-02-14
RAPPLER: Was there a singular moment when you knew you’d be marrying Ferdinand? Or was it a realization that was built through time?,,rappler,2022-02-14
"I am always surrounded by nuns. I was raised in a religious Catholic family and since childhood, my godmother aunt who is my second mother inspired me to be a nun like her. I also spent my formative years in a Catholic school and dreamt of being one of the nuns like my teachers. So when we celebrated our second anniversary as sweethearts as well as his 25th birthday and he proposed to me, I turned down his proposal. I was only 22! I found myself too young to get into something as serious as marriage at that time. ",,rappler,2022-02-14
"We continued to work with the nuns and priests of the Diocese of Isabela’s Social Action Center for two more years. When some nuns who are members of the Rural Missionaries of the Philippines invited me to join their search-in (a process of recruiting young women into their congregation), that was the time that I realized that I already wanted to marry Ferdinand. The problem was, he never mentioned marriage again after that incident when I refused his proposal! He was afraid of another rejection. When we celebrated our fourth anniversary, I asked him when he was planning to get married. We immediately decided on a date in December 1986, but due to his father’s schedule as an OFW, we decided to marry in May 1987.",,rappler,2022-02-14
RAPPLER: Can you describe to us what was happening around you when Ferdinand first started dating?,,rappler,2022-02-14
Ferdinand founded a human rights organization in 1984 – an especially dangerous year for anyone working for democracy and human rights. ,,rappler,2022-02-14
RAPPLER: How did you human rights work affect your relationship?,,rappler,2022-02-14
"When one is young, “grim and determined,” the danger of our work did not deter us. Even if we get water-cannoned and tear-gassed in a rally, we still attend the next one, bringing more participants with us. We instituted several security measures like being on time when we meet each other, checking on each other’s situation, and sending letters through friends when he went to Cagayan Valley ahead of me. Mobile phones and email were not available but despite that limitation, we were able to keep in touch.",,rappler,2022-02-14
"We had to survive on meager allowance as student activists and later on as human rights defenders, so we were always short on money. We only dated once in a restaurant and usually ate at UP cafeterias with our fellow activists, or feast on banana (turon) and vegetable spring rolls. We only watched movies twice or thrice with  friends. Our usual dates were attending rallies and taking long walks along the UP Oval. He brought me home from my theater rehearsals and visited me during weekends and semestral breaks. Many times he had to walk for several kilometers because 24/7 transportation was not available from our house to his destination. I also went to his house and pretended to like Ilokano vegetables dishes that his mother prepared. Looking back, I teased him that he missed the opportunity of dating me at the UP Lagoon, a popular tryst of lovers. ",,rappler,2022-02-14
"In 1984, Ferdinand went back to his region to help form the Cagayan Valley Human Rights Organization. The situation there was briefly described in the fifth paragraph onwards in this article about Bishop Miguel Purruganan, the Diocesan Social Action Center and the different religious organizations in Isabela.",,rappler,2022-02-14
"After a year, I joined Ferdinand as a Lay Assistant of the Rural Missionaries of the Philippines. We also supported peasants in their fight against usury, low prices of agricultural produce and inputs, especially the farmers at Hacienda Santa Isabela and San Antonio. During the 1986 snap elections, we campaigned against massive electoral fraud in Isabela where the Diocese of Ilagan and other religious congregations bravely took the lead despite harassments of Marcos supporters.",,rappler,2022-02-14
"After EDSA, there were several rallies in different towns and it led to a Sakbayan, a caravan of peasants and their supporters to ensure that their issues will be tackled in the peace talks between the Cory Aquino government and the National Democratic Front. Sadly, many harassments still continued even after the Marcos downfall. ",,rappler,2022-02-14
RAPPLER: Can you describe your Bulacan wedding to us?,,rappler,2022-02-14
"There are many Filipino wedding superstitions and one of these beliefs is that the life of a couple who are about to get married is in constant danger. Our parents and other relatives were very worried that we were traveling long-distances as the wedding day drew near. Of course, if a couple had the courage to fight a dictator, myths like these didn’t mean anything to us.",,rappler,2022-02-14
We hardly had time to prepare for our wedding. We were very busy campaigning for Partido Ng Bayan for the 1987 election. We decided to have our wedding in Meycauayan Church but we had to be in Isabela for an extended period of time due to campaign activities. I didn’t even have time to finalize the design of my wedding dress and other important details of our wedding. I even got late because I had a problem with the car that took me to the church. We ended up harassed on the wedding day itself and I started to feel feverish during the wedding reception. But we took time in writing a missal and carefully wrote our vows to be loyal to each other as we continue to serve our people. We also chose nationalist songs for the mass sung by our friends. Our Baguio honeymoon was postponed because I was hospitalized for a week due to kidney infection.,,rappler,2022-02-14
RAPPLER: How do you think the Marcos years and your work in human rights helped shape how you grew as individuals and as a couple?,,rappler,2022-02-14
"In 1991, I decided to work with Plan International and other NGOs that are different in nature with  advocacy. I finally chose to dedicate my time to promote and protect maternal and child health in 1997. It became a problem not just with juggling of our schedules, but it diverged from our expectation of each other. I was hoping Ferdinand would choose to teach in UP after we went back to study and finished our degrees one after another in 1995 to 1997. Instead, Ferdinand chose to remain with the human rights advocacy and worked for Bagong Alyansang Makabayan-NCR, a staunch critic of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (PGMA), while I worked as her Presidential Consultant on Infant and Young Child Feeding. ",,rappler,2022-02-14
"But being human rights advocates, we are always conscious to respect our individual choices and to be proud of the niche we created in our own fields. He is also respectful of my choices and my stand on issues that I usually express with passion. We had our own share of heated arguments and during these occasions, he would smile and ask gently if I am quarreling with him. That never fails to douse my temperament. ",,rappler,2022-02-14
"RAPPLER: Nearly 30 years later, it’s still dangerous to be a human rights defender. What was going through your mind when Ferdinand was detained in 2017?",,rappler,2022-02-14
"Aside from the specter of long imprisonment or murder, I was scared that he might suffer that same fate similar to his six male first cousins who died of heart attacks in their 40s. I had to cut short my US trip and go back to our country to take care of his needs, put his diet and other health habits back on track. A well-respected cardiologist prescribed him with six medicines, but his blood pressure remained at a dangerous level. I had to consult a lifestyle medicine doctor and a vegan cardiologist to get him off his medicines because he suffered from bloody stools. His blood pressure remained stable but we have to ensure very strict health habits that can be challenging inside prison. The anxiety and rigors of buying and transporting his food and other needs took a toll on my health, too. I had a rotator cuff injury and suffered from over-fatigue with severe dehydration last 2109. ",,rappler,2022-02-14
"When Senator Leila de Lima was jailed 12 days after my husband’s arrest, I was devastated. If this administration can jail a senator for flimsy reasons, I know they can do that to ordinary citizens as well. He is now jailed for four years, despite the fact that he was not convicted of all the outrageous criminal cases, namely illegal possession of firearms and murder and attempted murder filed against him. In October of 2017, a fellow inmate was released after seven years in prison. All the false charges against him were dismissed. We were very happy for his fellow detainee but at the same time, a question lingers in our mind. Will he stay in jail longer?",,rappler,2022-02-14
RAPPLER: Have you been able  or visit him during the pandemic? Has his case moved before the courts at all since? (Note: This interview took place in early 2021),,rappler,2022-02-14
"We exchange letters and I send his needs through a drop-off point every week so he can sustain his plant-based diet inside the prison. The last time I visited him was March 15, 2020, that day that the lockdown was enforced. Since the lockdown, he already had two hearings on his case on the illegal possession of firearms but his lawyers’ motion to dismiss his murder and attempted murder cases are still pending in another court since May 2017.",,rappler,2022-02-14
"RAPPLER: You survived difficult times in the ’80s. You’ve had to survive another difficult period since 2017. For some, it might be impossible to imagine love when the world is crumbling around you. What made (and still makes) you believe in love despite difficult times?",,rappler,2022-02-14
"The desire to love and serve our country albeit in different ways binds us together and develops the value of simple living. Most importantly, we remain faithful to each other despite several instances that we are apart, like travels abroad or during conferences and training we attend around the country. We also make sure we spend time with our daughter especially during special occasions and year-end trips. ",,rappler,2022-02-14
"We both agreed at this point that he saved my life by teaching me how to eat vegetables, and I also saved his life because I got him into a vegan diet. We find very simple ways (many times cheap) ways on how to show our love for each other. We are hoping that we will be together soon, spending our senior years in peace and health while we continue to do what we love best – to serve our country as true iskolar ng bayan. ",,rappler,2022-02-14

"“Two years after the world first heard about COVID-19, the coronavirus pandemic has led to a huge extension of state power over people’s lives and the erosion of individual freedoms,” said the EIU.

EIU singled out how governments have “introduced a panoply of intrusive and coercive measures” and how “some governments in developed democracies are singling out vaccine refusers for punitive treatment.” ,,rappler,2022-02-11
"In the Philippines, the government introduced a policy disallowing unvaccinated individuals from using public transportation, barring a few exemptions. Officials have since clarified its policy, following backlash from its unclear rules and erratic implementation. ",,rappler,2022-02-11
"The EIU also warned that keeping restrictions in place despite advances such as vaccine rollouts, the development of better treatments, and a “decline in the severity of infection associated with the most recent Omicron variant” would result in lesser acceptance of restrictions from government. ",,rappler,2022-02-11

We know what happens when we don’t stand up for facts: people are misled, they get angry, especially now in the time of COVID, we don’t know who to trust,” she said",,rappler,2022-01-26
"“We know that it’s impossible to have integrity of elections when we don’t have integrity of facts. We demand better from the social media platforms that deliver the facts. We’ve seen the damage lies can do and it’s time for us to work together,” Ressa added. ",,rappler,2022-01-26
"Ressa, like Reyes, knows what it’s like to be on the frontlines of the battle against disinformation and the challenges to journalists. The Nobel laureate and Rappler face several court cases and have been the targets of harassment online.",,rappler,2022-01-26

‘Significant decliner’ PH drops two places in 2021 Corruption Perception Index,,rappler,2022-01-25
"MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines dropped two places in Transparency International’s 2021 Corruption Perception Index, its second under the coronavirus pandemic. ",,rappler,2022-01-25
"The country ranked 117 out of 180 countries and territories in the index, a drop of two places from its rank in 2020, during the first year of the pandemic. Its Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) was 33, a one point dip from the previous year. ",,rappler,2022-01-25
"Transparency International is a global organization with national chapters in more than 100 countries and a goal to “end the injustice of corruption” in all fields of life – from business to government. The last two editions of the index, said Transparency International “reveals that corruption levels remain at a standstill worldwide.” ",,rappler,2022-01-25
" on paper, 131 countries have made no significant progress against corruption over the last decade, and this year 27 countries are at a historic low in their CPI score. Meanwhile, human rights and democracy across the world are under assault,” said the organization. ",,rappler,2022-01-25
"“Ensuring basic rights and freedoms means there is less space for corruption to go unchallenged,” it added. ",,rappler,2022-01-25
"Right beside the Philippines in the list are Algeria, Egypt, Zambia, and Nepal, all with a 33/100 score in the index. Thirty-three is the Philippines’ lowest score on the index since 2012. ",,rappler,2022-01-25
"The CPI is used to measure how corrupt is a country’s public sector, based on experts and businesspeople. The data, in  from 3 data sources that draws from 13 different corruption surveys and assessments. “These data sources are collected by a variety of reputable institutions, including the World Bank and the World Economic Forum,” said Transparency International. ",,rappler,2022-01-25
"The higher your CPI, the better – 100 means a country is perceived to be clean while 0 means you’re seen as highly corrupt. As reference, Denmark, Finland, and New Zealand topped the rankings with a score of 88. South Sudan, in strife despite the signing of a 2018 peace deal, was at the bottom of the list with a score of 11. ",,rappler,2022-01-25
"The data they use to measure the CPI, said Transparency International, covers the following: ",,rappler,2022-01-25
"The Philippines, Transparency International noted, was a “significant decliner,” having gone down 5 points since 2014. ",,rappler,2022-01-25
"“Since the election of Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines has also seen a sharp decline in freedom of association and freedom of expression, making it harder to speak up about corruption. In 2020, it was the country with the second highest number of murdered human rights defenders, with a total of 25 deaths,” said the report. ",,rappler,2022-01-25
"Little has changed in the Asia Pacific region from the year prior, with countries getting an average score of 45 – the same as 2020. Asia Pacific is home to 3 countries that recorded among the lowest scores in the list: Cambodia (23), Afghanistan (16) and North Korea (16). The most populous countries or biggest economies – China (45), India (40), Indonesia (38), Pakistan (28), and Bangladesh (26) – also had low scores in the index. ",,rappler,2022-01-25
"‘A concerning trend across some of these nations is a weakening of anti-corruption institutions or, in some cases, absence of an agency to coordinate action against corruption,” the organization noted. ",,rappler,2022-01-25
"The report also noted that “little has changed” despite the rise of mass movements against corruption in Asia. “Public outrage has instead been co-opted by strongmen – in the form of populist leaders in democratic countries and authoritarians elsewhere,” the organization said. ",,rappler,2022-01-25
"“From India to the Philippines (33) to China, such leaders have been able to portray themselves as more effective than state institutions and win mandates to gain and stay in power. However, only a few of these countries have managed to make progress in controlling corruption and these gains remain fragile. Furthermore, in most countries, corruption is spreading through severe restrictions on the very civil liberties – like freedom of association and speech – which allowed people to take to the streets and call for action,” it added. ",,rappler,2022-01-25
"The pandemic has also “opened a door to corruption and repression,” said the organziation, higlighting the importance of checks and balances alongside the rollout of economic recovery plans. “Wrongdoing in emergency procurement has led to price inflating, the theft of medical supplies and sales of counterfeit medicines and materials. This left many citizens more vulnerable to COVID-19 – and almost certainly cost lives,” it said. ",,rappler,2022-01-25
"Pandemic protocols, said the report, have also been used as an “excuse” to quiet down criticism or even to adopt “authoritarian approaches,” such as in Papua New Guinea and Fiji, the report said.  ",,rappler,2022-01-25

Sara Duterte’s push for mandatory military service shows ‘true militarist nature’ – groups,,rappler,2022-01-22
"MANILA, Philippines – Groups have denounced the suggestion of vice presidential aspirant Sara Duterte to make military service mandatory for Filipinos once they turn 18 years old. ",,rappler,2022-01-22
"“Vice presidential candidate Mayor Sara Duterte really showed her true militarist nature to the voting public when she offered he proposal that the youth undergo mandatory military service if ever she gets elected,” said Save Our Schools Network in a statement on Thursday, January 21. ",,rappler,2022-01-22
"Save Our Schools Network is an alliance of academic, religious, and civil groups advocating for the resumption of Lumad education. ",,rappler,2022-01-22

"It can be recalled that her father, President Rodrigo Duterte, also made a bid to make Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) mandatory for all college students early in his presidency, but this plan fizzled out. ROTC is a voluntary college program designed to produce military reservists.",,rappler,2022-01-22

When you turn) 18 years old, you’ll be given a subsidy, you’ll be asked to serve our country, doon sa (there at the) AFP,” Sara said on Wednesday, January 19, during a “virtual caravan” that featured her running mate Bongbong Marcos Jr and several senatorial candidates endorsed by the tandem. ",,rappler,2022-01-22
Save Our Schools Network pointed out that the “issue of discipline cannot be answered by submitting our youth to a militarist training that is known to abuse and murder its own cadets through hazing and is known for human rights abuses which we have experienced.”,,rappler,2022-01-22
"“The issue of patriotism is not simply learned by marching on the ground and carrying a rifle. Patriotism is already provided by schools, especially our Lumad schools that taught us to defend of our ancestral land and environment.  But sadly our Lumad schools are shut down, and our ancestral land have been plundered no thanks to her father president who reopened our lands to large-scale mining, plantations and the Chinese military and multinational firms,” the group said.

"In a separate statement on Friday, January 21, youth group Samahan ng Progresibong Kabataan said that any candidate running for public office who continue to support and promote militarism should “only be assumed as brutal, oppressive, and in service of only the ruling class.”",,rappler,2022-01-22
"“There is something to be said about how, instead of addressing the issues facing everyday Filipinos, Duterte seems hellbent on just adding to them. Proposing mandatory military service does nothing to address the surge in COVID-19 cases, rampant corruption in the health sector, and the crippling lack of social aid; in fact, such a proposal would only further divert crucial funding from these issues,” the group said.",,rappler,2022-01-22
The group added that Sara’s push for mandatory military service sends a strong message that “any dissent will be met with force.”,,rappler,2022-01-22
