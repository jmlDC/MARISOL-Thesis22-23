"-- The reform to apply to all active personnel and new entrants. -- Removal of automatic indexation of pension to the salary of active personnel of single ranks.-- Military and uniformed personnel will receive their pension starting at 57 years old, not automatically after 20 years of service.-- Mandatory contributions will be required for active personnel and new entrance similar to the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) pensioners.",,pna,2023-03-28
Diokno cited issues in the current pension system such as how it is non-contributory which means retirement pensions and benefits are fully funded by the national government through annual appropriations despite having no contribution from the retirees.,,pna,2023-03-28
"Under the proposed new pension scheme, he said “all those who are in active service and the new recruits will have to pay.”",,pna,2023-03-28
