AFP says PH has right to hold drills within territory as 'intruder' delays Balikatan main event,,mb,2023-04-26
The Philippines has an “inherent and invaluable” right to conduct military exercises within its own territory.,,mb,2023-04-26

"This was stressed by Colonel Michael Logico, executive agent for the Philippine side of the Exercise Balikatan 2023, after the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the United States Armed Forces conducted  joint littoral live fire exercise in San Antonio, Zambales on Wednesday, April 26, which served as the main event of this year's Balikatan.",,mb,2023-04-26
"“We are exercising inside of our territorial waters and inside of our territorial airspace and that is our inherent and invaluable right to exercise within our territory,” Logico told reporters after the live fire drill. ",,mb,2023-04-26
"The exercise was highlighted by the sinking of former Philippine Navy corvette BRP Pangasinan (PS-31) at 12 nautical miles from the shoreline through the firing of rockets, artilleries, and other aviation weapons. ",,mb,2023-04-26
The location of the ship is well within the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Philippines. The exercise was also held at approximately 100 nautical miles from Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal which was seized by China from the Philippines in a tense standoff in 2012.,,mb,2023-04-26
"Logico said he would not want to anticipate China’s reaction to the AFP and US military’s joint drills near the Scarborough Shoal. “I cannot speak for them (China),” he said.",,mb,2023-04-26
But the Balikatan main event was marked by a surprising delay when the radars of the AFP and US military detected an aerial intruder flying within the operational area where the sinking exercise was being held. The interloper was later identified as a “a private unregistered single craft aircraft.”,,mb,2023-04-26
Logico said they had to delay the firing of the rockets to sink BRP Pangasinan since it could pose danger to the interloper.,,mb,2023-04-26
"“Safety is always a primary consideration when we conduct the exercise. Any interloper or any intrusion into the exercise that will endanger the lives of people, whether its intentional or accidental, is our primary consideration. As a general SOP [standard operating procedure] we lift fires every time that there is an interloper to our territory,” he said.",,mb,2023-04-26
It has yet to be determined whether the aircraft got inside the operational area by mere accident or intentionally as a form of sabotage.,,mb,2023-04-26
"“We are not sure if it was intentional or accidental so I will not need to jump for a conclusion,” Logico said.",,mb,2023-04-26
"Meanwhile, Col. Jackson Doan, from the US Marine Corps Forces Pacific, said the live fire exercise was meant to develop the interoperability of the forces from the Philippines and US militaries so they can work together in future scenarios.",,mb,2023-04-26
"“The message is not geared toward anything outside of the strong relationship and bond with the Philippines. The message is very simple,” Doan said.",,mb,2023-04-26

That key element of partnership and resolve is far stronger than any other measures and technical prowess, any other measure of exploding targets or any other measure of offensive and defensive capability,” he continued.",,mb,2023-04-26
"“The resolve in partnership is far stronger than any technical element that we have and that’s the true message of Balikatan, in translation shoulder to shoulder. That doesn’t mean weapon to weapon. It really means family,” he added.",,mb,2023-04-26

"P20-per-kilo rice attainable with ramped up 'Masagana' program, says solon",,mb,2023-03-28
"The potential revival of the Masagana 99 program should have a higher target yield of palay (unhusked rice) in order to fulfill President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.'s election campaign promise of P20-per-kilo rice.",,mb,2023-03-28
"Thus, said administration solon Camarines Sur 2nd district Rep. LRay Villafuerte, majority leader of the powerful Commission on Appointments.",,mb,2023-03-28
"“The DA’s (Department of Agriculture) new strategy to significantly boost palay yields and meet President Marcos’ goal of attaining rice self-sufficiency in two years’ time should clear the way to the revival of the Masagana 99 program, which our Chief Executive’s father launched in 1973 to address a then-nationwide rice shortage,"" Villafuerte said, referring to the late President Ferdinand Marcos Sr.",,mb,2023-03-28
"However, with the average yield of big producers like China reaching about 6.5 metric tons (MT) per hectare, Villafuerte said “The target of the proposed Masagana redux is to produce at least 129 cavans a hectare instead of 99 cavans.”",,mb,2023-03-28
"""Higher palay yields will boost domestic supply of the staple, eventually pulling down its market rate to possibly as low as P20 a kilo as hoped for by the President,"" noted the Bicolano, who recently hosted Marcos in the latter’s visit to Camarines Sur.",,mb,2023-03-28
"Last March 16, Marcos launched the Kadiwa ng Pangulo center, the first such retail outlet in Bicol. Marcos is the concurrent DA secretary.",,mb,2023-03-28
There are now over 500 Kadiwa outlets nationwide that sell cheaper basic goods--including rice at P25 a kilo--and at the same time provide direct market access to local farmers and producers.,,mb,2023-03-28
"Marcos Sr.'s Masagana 99 enabled the country to  rice self-sufficient by 1975 and to even export the crop over the 1977 to 1978 period, according to Villafuerte.",,mb,2023-03-28
"Masagana 99 managed to achieve that by promoting the use of the high-yielding “miracle rice’ variety developed by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) headquartered in Los Baños, Laguna. From 40 canvans per hectare, the palay production was raised to 99 cavans under the program.",,mb,2023-03-28
"“But given last month’s decision by...Marcos to adopt higher-yielding hybrid seeds as a better option to the certified or inbred varieties now being used for palay production, the government’s goal of self-sufficiency after two years could be attained should a Masagana redux program target a production yield of at least 129 cavans each hectare, which is almost the average of the world’s largest producer China,” Villafuerte said.",,mb,2023-03-28
"He also said that, to ensure an even better Masagana program this time around, “The DA should work on crafting a supervised credit program that would be affordable for the would-be farmer-beneficiaries and at the same time be sustainable for both the government and the new program’s creditor-institutions.”",,mb,2023-03-28

'Are they covering up?': Barbers slams slow PNP probe on Mayo,,mb,2023-03-26

"“Why is it that said PNP-SITG is foot-dragging or dilly-dallying on their probe?"" Barbers, chairman of House Committee on Dangerous Drugs, said in a statement Sunday, March 26.",,mb,2023-03-26
"""Are they covering up for something we don’t know or are they still trying to make up a different script about his arrest and involvement in 'shabu' stockpiling and possibly for recycling?” he further wondered.",,mb,2023-03-26
"Mayo, a PNP intelligence officer, was arrested and implicated in the storage of nearly a ton of shabu or methamphetamine hydrochloride worth P6.7 billion in October last year in Manila.",,mb,2023-03-26
"Barbers said that while Mayo has a right to due process of the law, he has not heard an update from the PNP about the status of his administrative or criminal cases except saying “the case is still under investigation”.",,mb,2023-03-26
"But it's been six months since the incident, the Mindanaoan noted.",,mb,2023-03-26
"“Alam naman natin na hindi makakagalaw si Mayo mag-isa sa kanyang illegal na gawain.

We also want to know if the confiscated shabu from Tondo was a cache from past anti-drug operations or a brand new delivery from China),” he said.",,mb,2023-03-26
"“Sgt. Mayo, for all we know, is an owner of a lending institution catering to police officers. This, despite receiving a monthly salary of only P34,079.00.

The US has so far allocated over $82 million towards infrastructure projects at these sites.",,mb,2023-03-25

"“The identified EDCA sites are Philippine bases which we want to develop based on the requirements for strategic basing and development of the AFP. These were not US-dictated but identified by our armed forces,” Año explained.",,mb,2023-03-25
