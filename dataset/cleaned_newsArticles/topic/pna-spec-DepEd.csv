Solon hits 'same-sex union' inclusion in DepEd’s draft curriculum,,pna,2023-05-02
"MANILA – CIBAC Party-list Rep. Bro. Eddie Villanueva on Tuesday expressed apprehension over the Department of Education’s (DepEd) inclusion and promotion of gender fluidity, same-sex union, and same-sex marriage in its draft curriculum for Kindergarten to Grade 10 pupils.",,pna,2023-05-02
"“We are shocked to discover that the promotion of gender ideology, same-sex union, and same-sex marriage is slowly creeping under our noses into the very curriculum of our basic education! What is more worrying is the slant towards promoting and condoning such practices in the minds of our young students,” Villanueva said in a statement.",,pna,2023-05-02
"“Not only is this anti-God but also clearly unconstitutional! Section 13, Article II of the Constitution mandates that the State shall promote the moral and spiritual well-being of our youth. I do not see that the introduction of these topics into our basic education curriculum is heading in the right direction.”",,pna,2023-05-02
DepEd has released its revised curriculum draft for Kindergarten to Grade 10 students through its Facebook page and has invited the public and interested stakeholders to review it and provide feedback until May 3.,,pna,2023-05-02
"In the proposed new curriculum under the subject Araling Panlipunan 10, among the topics included to be taught to the children are the different genders and the meaning and benefits of same-sex unions.",,pna,2023-05-02
"“Though this is still a draft and, hopefully, will still undergo revisions, it is just very disturbing that there are proponents of gender ideology inside DepEd that inject this advocacy into the education of our youth,” Villanueva said. “I am calling all stakeholders to be more vigilant on this issue because this is a primordial concern that will shape the moral fiber of our youth.”",,pna,2023-05-02

We have strengthened our child protection mechanism and launched the Learner Telesafe Contact Center national hotline where our learners can report cases of abuse, including online child sexual exploitation,” she added.  Duterte also recognized the support of civil society in helping victims of such online dangers.  “Allow me to acknowledge the support of our civil society partners who steadfastly provide psychosocial and legal support for victims of child abuse and human trafficking,” she said.  Duterte’s push for digital inclusivity is in line with the international goal with the United Nations’ (UN) theme DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality. This year, the UN called for global leaders to help realize four digital targets for women and girls which include the removal of all barriers to access the digital world; the education and training of girls in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); the provision of opportunity for women to create technology that meets their needs; and the elimination of online gender-based violence.  “Today, a persistent gender gap in digital access keeps women from unlocking technology’s full potential,” the UN said.  “Their underrepresentation in STEM education and careers remains a major barrier to their participation in tech design and governance. And the pervasive threat of online gender-based violence --coupled with a lack of legal recourse-- too often forces them out of the digital spaces they do occupy,” it added.  UN data further shows there is a gender gap in internet usage between men and women, reaching as much as 259 million. Meanwhile, Duterte said that like digital inclusivity, it is also important for teenage mothers to continue their education.  “DepEd is also making sure that teenage mothers who have dropped out of formal school to take care of their children are provided with a second chance to finish basic education and pursue their dreams through the Alternative Learning System (ALS) or pursue technical skills training through our TESDA (Technical Education and Skills Development Authority) programs,” she said.",,pna,2023-03-08
