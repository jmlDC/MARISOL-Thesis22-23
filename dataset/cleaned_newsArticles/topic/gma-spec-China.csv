However, the US, to secure its hegemony and selfish geopolitical interests and out of the cold-war mentality, keeps upgrading military cooperation with the Philippines by adding EDCA bases and military deployment in this country,” the Embassy said.",,gma,2023-03-12
" “Whereas the US claims that such cooperation is intended to help the disaster relief efforts of the Philippines and some Americans even tout the EDCA sites as a driver of the local economy, it is plain and simple that those moves are part of the US efforts to encircle and contain China through its military alliance with this country.”",,gma,2023-03-12
