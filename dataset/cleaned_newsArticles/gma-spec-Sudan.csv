"Jinggoy Estrada to DOLE, OWWA: Ensure alternative livelihood programs for displaced OFWs from Sudan",
 Senator Jinggoy Estrada on Wednesday called on the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) to provide alternative livelihoods to overseas Filipino workers who have been displaced by the ongoing conflict in Sudan.,
" “Asahan na natin na karamihan sa mga OFWs na napilitang umuwi ng wala sa oras dahil sa tumitinding kaguluhan sa Sudan ay walang ipon...  Makabubuti siguro na mabahagian sila ng tulong ng gobyerno. May nakalaan tayong pondo para sa mga katulad nilang distressed o displaced OFWs,” Estrada, chairman of the  on labor and employment, said in a statement.",
 (Let's assume that most of the OFWs who were forced to return to the country have no savings. It is better to give them assistance. We have allocations distressed or displaced OFWs.),

Sa ganitong paraan, hindi sila daragdag sa bilang ng mga unemployed nating mga kababayan,” Estrada said.",
" (The government has a program that can help OFWs who are displaced and it is better to give them this kind of assistance so they can provide for their families. With this, the displaced OFWs will not add up to the number of unemployed Filipinos in the country.)",
