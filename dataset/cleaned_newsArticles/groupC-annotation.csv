443,"MANILA – The Department of Agriculture (DA) on Monday underscored the importance of food safety to public health, as it seized around PHP120 million worth of smuggled agri-fishery products in Navotas City.  In a radio-TV interview, DA Assistant Secretary for Inspectorate and Enforcement James Layug said the DA, together with partner agencies, inspected and raided seven warehouses in Navotas on March 17.  “‘Yung isang pinasok po natin, talyer po e. Pero sa loob niya, mayroong dalawang ‘yung plug-in na tinatawag. May container van sa loob na refrigerated tapos nakasaksak lang sa kuryente. Tapos sa loob naman, talagang gumawa lang ng kwarto tapos nilagyan ng mga refrigerated section  (One raided area is an auto garage shop. But inside, it has two so-called plug-ins. It has a refrigerated container van inside, plugged in electricity. Then inside, they made a room with a refrigerated section  he said.  Among the confiscated products include frozen pompano, pangasius, shrimp, chicken, frozen beef, frozen boneless beef, frozen spare ribs, frozen pork parts, frozen pork aorta, frozen squid rings and frozen pacific saury. However, Layug said more than the avoidance of necessary taxes and permits, the risk of having smuggled goods on the table is a health concern.  “Mas importante ay ‘yung food safety issue. Hindi ito dumaan sa tamang proseso. Hindi ho na-inspect o nabigyan ng sanitary phytosanitary clearance. So ang problema po natin dito is ‘pag napunta po ito sa public market o mga hapagkainan, danger ng public health issue (The food safety issue is more important. This is not undergoing the right process. It’s not inspected nor given sanitary phytosanitary clearance so our problem here is if it reaches the public market or the tables, the danger is a public health issue),” he said.  Layug added that this is possible since consumers do not usually search for the supply source when in the public market.  “May deception din ito. Kasi hindi naman ilalagay ‘yung ano e, kasi mga expired po ‘yung iba e. Ire-rebox lang nila ito, kapag ibinenta sa palengke, mga talipapa. Kung ikaw consumer, hindi mo naman na titingnan saan galing ito, titingnan mo kung mura (There’s a deception here because they are not putting (the expiration date), some are even expired. Others are just reboxed, then sold to markets. If you’re the consumer, you will no longer check where it came from. You will just look for cheaper prices),” he said.  To date, the DA will still look into the sources of the confiscated smuggled agri-fishery products.  Moreover, the DA said it will investigate possible diversion or technical smuggling after the seizure.",

Véron also said the EU is exploring the possibility to create a network of Copernicus partners in the Asean of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region aside from other parts of the world. ""The uptake of innovative technologies such as Copernicus will trigger growth, jobs and modernization of digital infrastructures that can be used in many sectors in the Philippines,” he said.  Philippine Space Agency Director General Joel Marciano Jr.  the partnership with the EU, saying it would boost the domestic space value chain, particularly in processing and using satellite images and space data.  ""CopPhil is an integral part of our efforts to mobilize space data for societal benefit and value, for strengthening the country's domestic space value chain, and for positioning the Philippines as a hub for space data mobilization excellence in the region,"" he said. Marciano cited as an example that PhilSA has provided Copernicus Sentinel data to the Department of Agriculture for road network monitoring, movement of goods, hazard mapping and ship detection. The open data from Copernicus, he said, has also enabled access to crucial data such as volcanic emission monitoring, mapping of canopy heights, crops, among others. ",

During the Laging Handa public briefing, BPI spokesperson Jose Diego Roxas assured that the Department of Agriculture (DA) is on top of the situation and the agencies are preparing for the possible effects of drought.  “Huwag pong mag-alala ang ating taumbayan… kami naman po ay nagpaplano nang maayos para ho malutas ang maaaring maging epekto ng El Niño (The public should not worry… we are properly planning to resolve the effects of El Niño),” he said.  Roxas said the DA is yet to specify its concrete steps as the plans are being finalized, but he cited the prepositioned support to farmers considering the possible impacts on vegetable crops.  “Nandiyan din po ang production support na doon po sa lugar na malubhang maaapektuhan po ng El Niño, mayroon pong mga buffer stock po ng seeds para po sa replanting kung kinakailangan (We also have the production support for areas that will be greatly affected by the El Niño, we have a buffer stock of seeds for replanting if needed),” he said.  He added that agricultural areas that are more likely to be less affected by drought will be strengthened to increase production to cover for the possible yield decline in the vulnerable areas.  Roxas also underscored the need for efficient irrigation and farming.  “The bottom line is the efficient use of natural resources like water, fertilizer, chemicals and others. It’s better that our farming will be precise. This means the utilization of resources or input should be just enough, nothing more, nothing less,” he added.  He said farmers may likewise opt to plant climate-smart varieties during El Niño using breeders-developed vegetables, corn and palay that can survive even with less water allocation amid increased heat.  Meanwhile, Roxas also urged the public to take part in the preparation to help farmers and authorities.  “Bilang tulong na lang din po ‘no, tamang consumption po ng ating mga pagkain nang sa ganoon, mabawasan po natin iyong mga sayang dulot po ng labis po na pagkonsumo ng pagkain (To help, we should have proper consumption of food so that we can prevent wastage due to excessive food consumption),” he added.

2665,"MANILA – The Philippine Information Agency (PIA), in partnership with the National Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP) of the Department of National Defense (DND), has underscored the importance of disseminating government policies and programs  the spread of fake news and misinformation and uphold national security.  The two agencies insisted on the stance as a high delegation of the National Defense College of the United Arab Emirates (NDC-UAE) paid a courtesy visit to the country alongside an institutional briefing.  In an interview, PIA Director-General Ramon Cualoping III said national security risks are no longer limited to kinetic, but more of cognitive warfare. “Cognitive so dapat naiintindihan ang mga proyekto, polisiya, programa ng pamahalaan. Kung hindi naiintindihan, nagkakaroon ng mistrust o pag-agam-agam, pagdududa sa ating pamahalaan. At kapag ‘yan nangyari, magiging vulnerable ‘yung ating mga kababayan para sa mga bagay which can affect national security (Cognitive, so the projects, policies and programs should be understood. If it’s misunderstood, there’s a mistrust, hesitations or doubts in our government. And once that happens, Filipinos shall be vulnerable to threats that may affect the national security),” he said.  Cualoping said although the government cannot dictate its people, explaining the administration’s program and projects is vital to ensure public trust.  “Ngayon, cognitive na e. Meaning cerebral, kung paano mag-isip ang isang tao, kung ano ‘yung thought process ng isang tao. That’s why dito sa PIA, gusto nating maging thought leaders ‘yung mga kababayan natin (Nowadays it’s cognitive. Meaning cerebral, or how the people think, how a person has his thought process. That’s why here in PIA, we want our fellow Filipinos to be thought leaders),” he added.  On the other hand, the spread of inaccurate information may hinder the dissemination of administration’s programs that are supposedly beneficial for Filipinos.  “There’s Twitter, Facebook, Tiktok, everything is there. Everyone has  a content producer or a creator. But now, the role of the government is to safeguard the entire state and the entire citizenry. Which means, whatever the government releases, the people should understand. Because the government has no program that will harm the people,” he said in mixed English and Filipino.  Moreover, NDCP acting Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean Dr. Alan Lachica said fake news or misinformation can turn down a government system.",
