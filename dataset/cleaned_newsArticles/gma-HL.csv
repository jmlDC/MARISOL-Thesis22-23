Hence, it is imperative that concerns voiced by seafarers themselves, such as unreasonable fees, corruption in training and maritime schools, requirements, and others, be given greater consideration,” she said in a statement.   “It is also important to observe that the majority of negative findings were due to deficiencies in the education system. We call on the Commission on Higher Education and the MARINA (Maritime Industry Authority) to continue to remedy such deficiencies,” she added.   Hontiveros said she would continue to advocate for the passage of the Magna Carta of Seafarers to protect and advance the rights and well-being of seafarers.   Senator Grace Poe echoed the statement of Hontiveros, saying there should be continuous training to increase the viability of Filipino workers.   “The continued recognition by the European Union of the certificates for Filipino seafarers is a crucial decision that will keep them onboard ships. During this turbulent period of the global economy, we cannot afford job losses that will bring economic difficulties to millions of families,” Poe said in a separate statement.   “As Filipino seafarers remain the preferred choice in the EU region, we should embark on continuous skills training to increase the viability of our workers. The government and private sector should step up efforts to use the period allowed by the EU to boost training and seriously heed the issues raised by the European Maritime Safety Agency,” she added.   Poe said the quality of maritime education would ensure the safety of travelers and secure the future of Filipino seafarers’ families.   Senator Joel Villanueva said he trusted the country’s maritime authorities and that they will continue to enhance efforts to  with the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention).",
