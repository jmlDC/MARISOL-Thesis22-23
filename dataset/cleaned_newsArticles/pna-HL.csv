"DA upholds food safety, seizes P120-M smuggled agri-fishery goods",
"MANILA – The Department of Agriculture (DA) on Monday underscored the importance of food safety to public health, as it seized around PHP120 million worth of smuggled agri-fishery products in Navotas City.  In a radio-TV interview, DA Assistant Secretary for Inspectorate and Enforcement James Layug said the DA, together with partner agencies, inspected and raided seven warehouses in Navotas on March 17.  “‘Yung isang pinasok po natin, talyer po e. Pero sa loob niya, mayroong dalawang ‘yung plug-in na tinatawag. May container van sa loob na refrigerated tapos nakasaksak lang sa kuryente. Tapos sa loob naman, talagang gumawa lang ng kwarto tapos nilagyan ng mga refrigerated section  (One raided area is an auto garage shop. But inside, it has two so-called plug-ins. It has a refrigerated container van inside, plugged in electricity. Then inside, they made a room with a refrigerated section  he said.  Among the confiscated products include frozen pompano, pangasius, shrimp, chicken, frozen beef, frozen boneless beef, frozen spare ribs, frozen pork parts, frozen pork aorta, frozen squid rings and frozen pacific saury. However, Layug said more than the avoidance of necessary taxes and permits, the risk of having smuggled goods on the table is a health concern.  “Mas importante ay ‘yung food safety issue. Hindi ito dumaan sa tamang proseso. Hindi ho na-inspect o nabigyan ng sanitary phytosanitary clearance. So ang problema po natin dito is ‘pag napunta po ito sa public market o mga hapagkainan, danger ng public health issue (The food safety issue is more important. This is not undergoing the right process. It’s not inspected nor given sanitary phytosanitary clearance so our problem here is if it reaches the public market or the tables, the danger is a public health issue),” he said.  Layug added that this is possible since consumers do not usually search for the supply source when in the public market.  “May deception din ito. Kasi hindi naman ilalagay ‘yung ano e, kasi mga expired po ‘yung iba e. Ire-rebox lang nila ito, kapag ibinenta sa palengke, mga talipapa. Kung ikaw consumer, hindi mo naman na titingnan saan galing ito, titingnan mo kung mura (There’s a deception here because they are not putting (the expiration date), some are even expired. Others are just reboxed, then sold to markets. If you’re the consumer, you will no longer check where it came from. You will just look for cheaper prices),” he said.  To date, the DA will still look into the sources of the confiscated smuggled agri-fishery products.  Moreover, the DA said it will investigate possible diversion or technical smuggling after the seizure.",

In an interview, PIA Director-General Ramon Cualoping III said national security risks are no longer limited to kinetic, but more of cognitive warfare. “Cognitive so dapat naiintindihan ang mga proyekto, polisiya, programa ng pamahalaan. Kung hindi naiintindihan, nagkakaroon ng mistrust o pag-agam-agam, pagdududa sa ating pamahalaan. At kapag ‘yan nangyari, magiging vulnerable ‘yung ating mga kababayan para sa mga bagay which can affect national security (Cognitive, so the projects, policies and programs should be understood. If it’s misunderstood, there’s a mistrust, hesitations or doubts in our government. And once that happens, Filipinos shall be vulnerable to threats that may affect the national security),” he said.  Cualoping said although the government cannot dictate its people, explaining the administration’s program and projects is vital to ensure public trust.  “Ngayon, cognitive na e. Meaning cerebral, kung paano mag-isip ang isang tao, kung ano ‘yung thought process ng isang tao. That’s why dito sa PIA, gusto nating maging thought leaders ‘yung mga kababayan natin (Nowadays it’s cognitive. Meaning cerebral, or how the people think, how a person has his thought process. That’s why here in PIA, we want our fellow Filipinos to be thought leaders),” he added.  On the other hand, the spread of inaccurate information may hinder the dissemination of administration’s programs that are supposedly beneficial for Filipinos.  “There’s Twitter, Facebook, Tiktok, everything is there. Everyone has  a content producer or a creator. But now, the role of the government is to safeguard the entire state and the entire citizenry. Which means, whatever the government releases, the people should understand. Because the government has no program that will harm the people,” he said in mixed English and Filipino.  Moreover, NDCP acting Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean Dr. Alan Lachica said fake news or misinformation can turn down a government system.",

We have the technical capabilities and the experts,"" Phivolcs Director Teresito Bacolcol told the Philippine News Agency. Raymond Patrick Maximo, Phivolcs Science Research Specialist, said these equipment include Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy, X-ray Fluorescence, Fourier-transform Infrared Spectrometer, etc.  Bacolcol said the PNRI will place equipment on active faults to measure the radon gas. Phivolcs, on the other hand, will trace where these active faults are located.  He added that the partnership is essential also because the PNRI checks potential sites for nuclear power plants.  Meanwhile, according to Phivolcs, the two agencies will work on projects in the fields of geochemistry, isotopic techniques, volcanism, active faults, geothermal and volcano-hydrothermal. ""Isotopic techniques are ways to analyze isotopes. We would like to develop methods to measure isotopes in the substance. In the case of volcanoes, (we will) measure isotopes in volcanic deposits or rocks,"" Maximo told the PNA. Sulfur isotopes, for example, will tell whether there is new magma involved in a volcanic eruption, he said. Under the partnership, Phivolcs will provide technical support for fieldwork and sample collection. It will also facilitate data acquisition from local sources. Aside from coordinating with the PNRI for joint publication of study findings, the Phivolcs will also use the projects' output in future operations if isotopic techniques are proven accurate in identifying the movements of active faults.  The PNRI, on the other hand, will coordinate project activities with local officials and residents. The PNRI will regularly conduct radon and thoron measurements for monitoring the movements of active faults.  Among other activities, the PNRI will facilitate mineral chemistry, geochronological and geochemical analyses in partner institutions. ",
