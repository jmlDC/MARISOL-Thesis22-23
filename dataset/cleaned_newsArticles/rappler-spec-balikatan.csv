"US military: PH owns EDCA sites, can only be used by Americans when invited",
"MANILA, Philippines – A United States military officer reiterated that the Philippines has sole ownership of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) sites that will be built in the country. ",
"During his meeting with Manila’s acting Department of National Defense (DND) Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., US military  Admiral John Aquilino said that EDCA sites were “sovereign property of the Philippines and “they will be utilized jointly by the PH and US, and only upon the invitation of the Philippines.” The meeting was held on Friday, April 28. ",
"On February 2, Galvez and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the Philippines and the US had agreed on four new local military bases, where American troops would be allowed to build facilities and preposition military equipment. The longtime allies struck the deal nine years after they signed the EDCA, which further strengthened the relationship between the two countries.",
"The agreement on the establishment of EDCA sites was made less than a year into the term of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who was more open  and transacting with the US. Marcos’ predecessor Rodrigo Duterte was known for his tirades against the US and his threat to scrap the Visiting Forces Agreement. ",
"Not only that, Duterte also displayed his inclination toward China throughout his six-year term.",
"During the April 28 meeting, Galvez also suggested the finalization of the joint sails agreement and Joint Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Operations between the Philippine and US navies. ",
"In return, the US military  said they were ready to “conduct such Cooperative Deployments in order to protect the  freedom of navigation, and maintain a free, open, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.”",

It was also the first time the exercise featured live-fire exercises using new weapons such as the Javelin anti-tank missile and the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System. ",
"The exercise also focused mainly on naval  post, and cyber defense exercises. In his speech, Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff General Andres Centino also noted the importance of this year’s Balikatan. ",
"“The strong results of Balikatan Exercise 38-2023 and the robust relationship among like-minded allies are made more significant given the current security environment and the real threats that continue to evolve within the region. It is evident that all our exercise goals were met and achieved,” Centino said.",
"Galvez, meanwhile, said the participation of other observer nations in the exercise was an “explicit demonstration of solidarity for peace and stability in the region.” Manila’s acting defense chief said the attendance of those countries proved that the Philippines and US were not alone in ensuring security and peace. ",
"Among the observer nations were: Brunei, Canada, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. ",
"As regional tensions rise, PH eyes ‘bigger’ Balikatan in 2024",

As a simple ceremony on Friday, April 28, marked the close of the largest ever joint Balikatan exercises between the Philippines and the United States, the country’s coast guard revealed it was again bullied by Chinese vessels in the Ayungin Shoal.",
"And as the latest bullying in Philippine waters punctuated the Balikatan closing ceremony in Camp Aguinaldo, the chief of Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) said they were eyeing even bigger war games with the US for 2024.",

Cycle ito, pagkatapos nito (this is a cycle, after this), there is a whole year of preparation of what needs to be improved or refined,”  AFP chief General Andres Centino, told the press at the sidelines at the end of the 38th Balikatan exercises. ",
"“Kung nakita natin, if there’s a need, dagdagan natin (If we look at it, and there’s a need, let’s make it bigger). It would be better,” Centino said.",
"Although military officials previously said the expanded exercises were not targeted toward any country, the rising tension in the region did not go unnoticed at the conclusion of the exercises held at the general headquarters of the AFP. ",
"Prior to Friday’s closing of Balikatan, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) released information about an April 23 incident involving a near-crash between Chinese and Philippine vessels. The PCG also disclosed that it spotted nearly 100 alleged Chinese maritime vessels in the West Philippine Sea.",
"“In the past few years, we have seen more threats to the region than we have in the past few  These include challenges to the rules-based international order via provocations in the South China Sea, as well as global issues like climate change, environmental degradation, and water scarcity,” US Ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson said.",
"Retired general Carlito Galvez, the officer-in-charge of the Department of Defense, said that this was a Balikatan of many firsts.",
"“This was no ordinary iteration [of Balikatan]. Aside from being the largest exercise so far with 17,000 Filipino and American troops, with 111 Australian troops, it’s the first with live fire drills and the first where a president stayed,” Galvez said.",
He mentioned the last  to attend the Balikatan was the late president Benigno Aquino III. ,
"Aquino’s successor, Rodrigo Duterte, did not attend the Balikatan and had even threatened to cancel the war games. ",
Duterte’s disinterested attitude towards Balikatan was part of his China pivot during his administration.,
Galvez also said this was the first time participants had cyber defense training as well. ,
"The retired AFP chief also said said the two militaries boosted their ground, air, and maritime capabilities through the war games, which would continue through the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement and other agreements between the two countries. ",
"Centino said that aside from equipment and training, the US military also benefitted from the AFP sharing its experience.",
"“What I can say is that sa side natin – I can only speak for the AFP – maganda ang experience because it’s a top level quality training kasi siguro dehado [tayo] sa equipment ano, but marami tayong experience that we can share also,” Centino said. (The experience we had is good because it’s a top quality training and maybe because we are at a disadvantage with equipment, we have many experiences that we can share also) ",
"“But I think in the overall exchange, we benefited from these activities,” he said. ",
"Aside from military exercises, the Balikatan also held humanitarian assistance and disaster preparedness projects. ",

Marcos has said he would press his US counterpart to “make clear” the extent of  to protect the Philippines under the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty amid rising regional tensions.

Despite promising continuity of the Duterte administration’s policy, Marcos has been much warmer towards the US even as he’s made efforts to keep good ties with China.",
