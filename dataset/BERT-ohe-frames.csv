Kailangang may natutunan sa naging banta sa hanapbuhay ng ating seafarers (We must learn from this threat to the livelihood of our seafarers). Hence, it is imperative that concerns voiced by seafarers themselves, such as unreasonable fees, corruption in training and maritime schools, requirements, and others, be given greater consideration,” she said in a statement.   “It is also important to observe that the majority of negative findings were due to deficiencies in the education system. We call on the Commission on Higher Education and the MARINA (Maritime Industry Authority) to continue to remedy such deficiencies,” she added.   Hontiveros said she would continue to advocate for the passage of the Magna Carta of Seafarers to protect and advance the rights and well-being of seafarers.   Senator Grace Poe echoed the statement of Hontiveros, saying there should be continuous training to increase the viability of Filipino workers.   “The continued recognition by the European Union of the certificates for Filipino seafarers is a crucial decision that will keep them onboard ships. During this turbulent period of the global economy, we cannot afford job losses that will bring economic difficulties to millions of families,” Poe said in a separate statement.   “As Filipino seafarers remain the preferred choice in the EU region, we should embark on continuous skills training to increase the viability of our workers. The government and private sector should step up efforts to use the period allowed by the EU to boost training and seriously heed the issues raised by the European Maritime Safety Agency,” she added.   Poe said the quality of maritime education would ensure the safety of travelers and secure the future of Filipino seafarers’ families.   Senator Joel Villanueva said he trusted the country’s maritime authorities and that they will continue to enhance efforts to  with the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,GMA

It’s better that our farming will be precise. This means the utilization of resources or input should be just enough, nothing more, nothing less,” he added.  He said farmers may likewise opt to plant climate-smart varieties during El Niño using breeders-developed vegetables, corn and palay that can survive even with less water allocation amid increased heat.  Meanwhile, Roxas also urged the public to take part in the preparation to help farmers and authorities.  “Bilang tulong na lang din po ‘no, tamang consumption po ng ating mga pagkain nang sa ganoon, mabawasan po natin iyong mga sayang dulot po ng labis po na pagkonsumo ng pagkain (To help, we should have proper consumption of food so that we can prevent wastage due to excessive food consumption),” he added.

"MANILA – The Philippines and the European Union (EU) on Monday launched the Copernicus Capacity Support Action Programme for the Philippines (CopPhil), a first in the region space cooperation program worth PHP610 million. Copernicus is the EU's earth observation flagship program that provides free environment and climate data derived from a constellation of satellites – the Sentinels -- which monitor the earth and its many ecosystems 24 hours daily. CopPhil seeks to aid Philippine authorities develop national systems to make use of EU’s earth observation’s satellites data in disaster mitigation and climate change adaptation and food security strategies. ""To be most effective in reducing disaster risk, an integrated systems approach to governance, featuring strong coordination and cooperation across sectors and levels is needed,"" said Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Secretary Renato Solidum Jr. during the launch in Pasay City.He added that if the country could prevent hazards from  disasters, it could also futureproof its development and economic gains.  Solidum said the demand for innovative approaches that can create disaster resilience have  bigger. The Philippines, for instance, is constantly confronted with climate and disaster risks, and is vulnerable to its impacts, he pointed out. ""CoPhil will develop and leverage our own Space Science and Technology applications to strengthen the nation’s resilience to disasters and climate change,” he said. He added that the agency has been utilizing Sentinel datasets for land cover mapping, aquaculture monitoring, and forest and watershed management monitoring around the Philippines. Using the Copernicus data collection system would support the Philippine government's decision-making and policy implementation monitoring based on timely and accurate data, Solidum said. He also said the data would help the government gain an improved understanding of hazards and risks from the space perspective, identify challenges and identify analysis tools to support planning and decision-making. For his part, EU Ambassador to the Philippines Luc  that the cooperation program will lead to ""a stronger and more shock-resilient Filipino economy and society."" Véron also said the EU is exploring the possibility to create a network of Copernicus partners in the Asean of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region aside from other parts of the world. ""The uptake of innovative technologies such as Copernicus will trigger growth, jobs and modernization of digital infrastructures that can be used in many sectors in the Philippines,” he said.  Philippine Space Agency Director General Joel Marciano Jr.  the partnership with the EU, saying it would boost the domestic space value chain, particularly in processing and using satellite images and space data.  ""CopPhil is an integral part of our efforts to mobilize space data for societal benefit and value, for strengthening the country's domestic space value chain, and for positioning the Philippines as a hub for space data mobilization excellence in the region,"" he said. Marciano cited as an example that PhilSA has provided Copernicus Sentinel data to the Department of Agriculture for road network monitoring, movement of goods, hazard mapping and ship detection. The open data from Copernicus, he said, has also enabled access to crucial data such as volcanic emission monitoring, mapping of canopy heights, crops, among others.

"MANILA – The Department of Agriculture (DA) on Monday underscored the importance of food safety to public health, as it seized around PHP120 million worth of smuggled agri-fishery products in Navotas City.  In a radio-TV interview, DA Assistant Secretary for Inspectorate and Enforcement James Layug said the DA, together with partner agencies, inspected and raided seven warehouses in Navotas on March 17.  “‘Yung isang pinasok po natin, talyer po e. Pero sa loob niya, mayroong dalawang ‘yung plug-in na tinatawag. May container van sa loob na refrigerated tapos nakasaksak lang sa kuryente. Tapos sa loob naman, talagang gumawa lang ng kwarto tapos nilagyan ng mga refrigerated section  (One raided area is an auto garage shop. But inside, it has two so-called plug-ins. It has a refrigerated container van inside, plugged in electricity. Then inside, they made a room with a refrigerated section  he said.  Among the confiscated products include frozen pompano, pangasius, shrimp, chicken, frozen beef, frozen boneless beef, frozen spare ribs, frozen pork parts, frozen pork aorta, frozen squid rings and frozen pacific saury. However, Layug said more than the avoidance of necessary taxes and permits, the risk of having smuggled goods on the table is a health concern.  “Mas importante ay ‘yung food safety issue. Hindi ito dumaan sa tamang proseso. Hindi ho na-inspect o nabigyan ng sanitary phytosanitary clearance. So ang problema po natin dito is ‘pag napunta po ito sa public market o mga hapagkainan, danger ng public health issue (The food safety issue is more important. This is not undergoing the right process. It’s not inspected nor given sanitary phytosanitary clearance so our problem here is if it reaches the public market or the tables, the danger is a public health issue),” he said.  Layug added that this is possible since consumers do not usually search for the supply source when in the public market.  “May deception din ito. Kasi hindi naman ilalagay ‘yung ano e, kasi mga expired po ‘yung iba e. Ire-rebox lang nila ito, kapag ibinenta sa palengke, mga talipapa. Kung ikaw consumer, hindi mo naman na titingnan saan galing ito, titingnan mo kung mura (There’s a deception here because they are not putting (the expiration date), some are even expired. Others are just reboxed, then sold to markets. If you’re the consumer, you will no longer check where it came from. You will just look for cheaper prices),” he said.  To date, the DA will still look into the sources of the confiscated smuggled agri-fishery products.  Moreover, the DA said it will investigate possible diversion or technical smuggling after the seizure.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Philippine News Agency

"MANILA – The Philippine Information Agency (PIA), in partnership with the National Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP) of the Department of National Defense (DND), has underscored the importance of disseminating government policies and programs  the spread of fake news and misinformation and uphold national security.  The two agencies insisted on the stance as a high delegation of the National Defense College of the United Arab Emirates (NDC-UAE) paid a courtesy visit to the country alongside an institutional briefing.  In an interview, PIA Director-General Ramon Cualoping III said national security risks are no longer limited to kinetic, but more of cognitive warfare. “Cognitive so dapat naiintindihan ang mga proyekto, polisiya, programa ng pamahalaan. Kung hindi naiintindihan, nagkakaroon ng mistrust o pag-agam-agam, pagdududa sa ating pamahalaan. At kapag ‘yan nangyari, magiging vulnerable ‘yung ating mga kababayan para sa mga bagay which can affect national security (Cognitive, so the projects, policies and programs should be understood. If it’s misunderstood, there’s a mistrust, hesitations or doubts in our government. And once that happens, Filipinos shall be vulnerable to threats that may affect the national security),” he said.  Cualoping said although the government cannot dictate its people, explaining the administration’s program and projects is vital to ensure public trust.  “Ngayon, cognitive na e. Meaning cerebral, kung paano mag-isip ang isang tao, kung ano ‘yung thought process ng isang tao. That’s why dito sa PIA, gusto nating maging thought leaders ‘yung mga kababayan natin (Nowadays it’s cognitive. Meaning cerebral, or how the people think, how a person has his thought process. That’s why here in PIA, we want our fellow Filipinos to be thought leaders),” he added.  On the other hand, the spread of inaccurate information may hinder the dissemination of administration’s programs that are supposedly beneficial for Filipinos.  “There’s Twitter, Facebook, Tiktok, everything is there. Everyone has  a content producer or a creator. But now, the role of the government is to safeguard the entire state and the entire citizenry. Which means, whatever the government releases, the people should understand. Because the government has no program that will harm the people,” he said in mixed English and Filipino.

""PNRI has the equipment. We need their help because they know how to run these equipment. We have the technical capabilities and the experts,"" Phivolcs Director Teresito Bacolcol told the Philippine News Agency. Raymond Patrick Maximo, Phivolcs Science Research Specialist, said these equipment include Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy, X-ray Fluorescence, Fourier-transform Infrared Spectrometer, etc.  Bacolcol said the PNRI will place equipment on active faults to measure the radon gas. Phivolcs, on the other hand, will trace where these active faults are located.  He added that the partnership is essential also because the PNRI checks potential sites for nuclear power plants.  Meanwhile, according to Phivolcs, the two agencies will work on projects in the fields of geochemistry, isotopic techniques, volcanism, active faults, geothermal and volcano-hydrothermal. ""Isotopic techniques are ways to analyze isotopes. We would like to develop methods to measure isotopes in the substance. In the case of volcanoes, (we will) measure isotopes in volcanic deposits or rocks,"" Maximo told the PNA.
