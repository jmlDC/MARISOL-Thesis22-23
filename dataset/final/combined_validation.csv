13,"The contrast between the Senate and the House of Representatives has rarely been so stark.

On Thursday, the House had two and a half hours of crisp debate on whether to ban semiautomatic assault weapons. Almost every seat was filled. Most representatives spoke for a minute or two. No one spoke for more than five.

Then, before 5 P.M., they voted. The excitement built as the running tally was registered on the electronic scoreboard overhead. After 15 minutes, the opponents of the ban were ahead, 214 to 213. Then a Congressman switched, and the proponents were ahead. Two more voted yes. One voted no. And that was it. The bill was approved by the narrowest of margins, 216 to 214, and the House went on to other matters.

In the Senate, meanwhile, the business was a bill that would prohibit members of Congress from accepting gifts and meals and expense-paid trips to fancy resorts. Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who was the bill's floor manager, explained why it was needed. A recent poll that he cited time and again had asked this question: Which do you think really controls the Federal Government in Washington? These choices were the President, Congress or special interests. The responses, Senator Levin kept saying with a flourish, were these: The President, 7 percent; Congress, 22 percent; special interests, 50 percent.

An upward price trend continued Friday for the Eastern Belt. Volume remained heavy and no major change was reported in quality. Loan receipts increased slightly, but were still relatively light.

Auctions for the week totaled 30,161,252 gross pounds and averaged $179.16. Season-to-date figures reached 164,533,151 pounds, averaging $177.45 per hundred.

About six out of every ten bid averages recorded increases this week. Leaf offerings were steady to $2 higher, while cutters and lugs gained $2 to $3. The few losses that did occur, some as much as $9, were mainly centered on nondescript tobacco. A range of $176 to $184 per hundred covered most of the heavy volume marketings.

Producers delivered 1.4 percent of this week's sales to the Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corp., raising the season figure to 0.4 percent.

Markets on the Old Belt also saw improvements. A good majority of the bid averages reported small gains this week. Volume was moderate to heavy at most points, and loan receipts were up slightly.

This week's auctions totaled 20,146,772 gross pounds, averaging $176.15 per hundred. Season totals are 112.4 million pounds, at $178.89 per hundred.

For the week, about two-thirds of the bid averages were unchanged to higher, while one-third declined. Gains were mainly $1 to $2 and were centered on cutters, ripe lugs, and primings. Losses were $1 to $3, appearing for most leaf and unripe lug grades. The bulk of bid averages were between $172 and $179 this week. Leaf grades were brought from $180 to $184 per hundred.

Majorities viewed easy-going moderation and comforting compromise as the religious path that counted as ""just right.""

Conservative Judaism -- the ""middle branch"" of the ancient faith -- always exemplified the ""Goldilocks"" orientation with its emphasis on the ""sweet spot"" between stringencies of Orthodox observance and the anything-goes adaptability of Reform. But just before Passover, the Conservative movement's  flagship institution, The Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS), announced a controversial decision highlighting the painful contradictions of middle way religions.

Following the findings  of an expert panel filed last December, JTS signaled its intention to accept openly gay candidates for the rabbinate and to raise no objection to their involvement in same-sex commitment ceremonies.  For a movement that still stresses time-honored standards of Sabbath observance and kosher food, this represents a stunning break with tradition. A spiritual leader proudly, publicly promoting consumption of pork would never fit in with the Conservative rabbinate, but this same denomination now will sanction rabbis who call unblushing communal attention to their personal practice of sexual relations that the Torah describes as ""abomination.""

This language was put into the Constitution due to a court striking down a law banning concealed weapons.

The district expected from 60 to 100 employees to apply.

Participation usually is low because most public employers don't subsidize domestic partner benefits. But what sets the school district apart is that the district's 12,000 teachers aren't eligible.

Unlike Broward and Miami-Dade school districts, where all employees can buy coverage, only school administrators and certain non-union secretaries - about 1,500 people - can qualify in Palm Beach County.

School board member Monroe Benaim, who pushed for domestic-partner benefits as a way to stay competitive with neighboring school districts, hopes the pilot is a stopgap measure until a more comprehensive program is approved.

Paek and co-author Albert Gunther from the University of Wisconsin-Madison examined surveys from 1,700 middle school students about their exposure to anti-smoking ads and their intention to smoke. The study will be published in the August issue of the journal Communication Research.

The study is the latest in a string of research showing that anti-smoking campaigns often have little to no impact on teens. In 2002, a study commissioned by an anti-smoking foundation found tobacco manufacturer Philip Morris' youth anti-smoking campaign was making students more likely to smoke.

Paek said the data showed middle school students are more likely to be influenced by the perception of what their friends are doing, and that anti-smoking campaigns should be more focused on peer relations.

""Rather than saying, 'Don't smoke,' it is better to say, 'Your friends are listening to this message and not smoking,'"" she said. ""It doesn't really matter what their peers are actually doing.""",10

""Everyone says you can't be elected in Pennsylvania if you are in favor of gun control of any kind,"" Katz told them.

""I said, 'It's time for the Republican Party to show some leadership on this issue. We're smart people. We're surrounded by smart people. Smart people can figure out which weapons are legitimate hunting and self-protection weapons. And the ones that are not, let's get them off the streets.'

""Then I turned to Ridge and said, 'For someone who professes so much concern about violence in the schools, it would have been good if you had shown a little courage and voted for the Brady bill.' He said nothing. There was a hush in the room.""

Katz told how his 8-year-old son had been held up at gunpoint by a kid who wanted his jacket. ""I said, 'When I'm governor of Pennsylvania, I will ban the sale of assault weapons, and I'll find a way to get rid of the Saturday night specials.""",12

1,"Prices continued to improve on North Carolina's three flue-cured tobacco markets at the close of the sixth week of sales, the Federal-State Tobacco Market News Service reported.

An upward price trend continued Friday for the Eastern Belt. Volume remained heavy and no major change was reported in quality. Loan receipts increased slightly, but were still relatively light.

Auctions for the week totaled 30,161,252 gross pounds and averaged $179.16. Season-to-date figures reached 164,533,151 pounds, averaging $177.45 per hundred.

About six out of every ten bid averages recorded increases this week. Leaf offerings were steady to $2 higher, while cutters and lugs gained $2 to $3. The few losses that did occur, some as much as $9, were mainly centered on nondescript tobacco. A range of $176 to $184 per hundred covered most of the heavy volume marketings.

Producers delivered 1.4 percent of this week's sales to the Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corp., raising the season figure to 0.4 percent.

Markets on the Old Belt also saw improvements. A good majority of the bid averages reported small gains this week. Volume was moderate to heavy at most points, and loan receipts were up slightly.

This week's auctions totaled 20,146,772 gross pounds, averaging $176.15 per hundred. Season totals are 112.4 million pounds, at $178.89 per hundred.

For the week, about two-thirds of the bid averages were unchanged to higher, while one-third declined. Gains were mainly $1 to $2 and were centered on cutters, ripe lugs, and primings. Losses were $1 to $3, appearing for most leaf and unripe lug grades. The bulk of bid averages were between $172 and $179 this week. Leaf grades were brought from $180 to $184 per hundred.",0

5,"Gay marriage advocates on Thursday urged a federal appeals court to reject a bid to reconsider last month's ruling striking down California's voter-approved ban on same-sex nuptials.

In court papers filed with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyers for same-sex couples argued that another review of the legal challenge to Proposition 8 is ""an unnecessary step"" that will delay the outcome. San Francisco city officials also filed documents asking the court to reject the latest legal volley by Proposition 8 backers.

""Two federal courts have already found Proposition 8 unconstitutional,"" gay marriage supporters wrote. ""Yet plaintiffs -- along with thousands of other gay and lesbian Californians -- still suffer the daily indignity and humiliation of having the state designate their relationships as second-class pairings unworthy of the name 'marriage.'""

A three-judge 9th Circuit panel in February ruled 2-1 that Proposition 8 violated the equal protection rights of same-sex couples because without legal or social justification it stripped them of an established right to marry in California.

But Proposition 8 backers last week asked the 9th Circuit to rehear the case with an 11-judge panel, an ""en banc"" review. A majority of the court's 25 full-time judges must vote to rehear the case, a move most legal experts say is unlikely given the 9th Circuit's current ideological makeup.

The legal maneuvering postpones the eventual likelihood of the U.S. Supreme Court being asked to address the Proposition 8 challenge.

Markets were firm on the Eastern Belt. Primings and lugs, which make up the bulk of sales, saw small increases of mainly $1 per hundred.

Averages were between $182 and $187 for leaf tobacco, $167 to $169 for cutters, and $162 to $167 per hundred for primings and lugs.

The proportion of lug tobacco increased to 45 percent of sales, while carryover leaf dropped to 39 percent. Maturity of offerings improved, as around 81 percent of the volume was mature or better.

Gross sales for the Eastern Belt Tuesday totaled 7,442,000 pounds and averaged $175.81. For the season, sales amounted to 59.9 million pounds, returning $180.13 per hundred. Loan receipts remained extremely low, as only 0.1 percent of Tuesday's sales was placed into the Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative Stabilization Corp. For the season, the corporation has accepted 0.2 percent of sales.

Demand was good at Old Belt auctions. Carryover offerings continued to dominate sales. Volume was heavy and loan receipts were light.

Grade averages for leaf tobacco remained unchanged at $184. Bids for cutters and lower stalk marketings varied $1 to $3. Cutters sold from $178 to $181, lugs brought from $164 to $169, and primings ranged between $156 and $165 per hundred. Maturity declined with 84 percent of the tobacco considered mature to mellow. However, quality improved with 93 percent classing as fair or better.

5,"The freeze came after U.S. District Judge Robert Broomfield ruled Friday that a 2005 state law does not allow Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio or county prosecutors to charge immigrants with conspiracy to smuggle themselves across the border. Broomfield said the policy criminalizes actions that federal law treats as a civil matter.

""It is hard to imagine a more blatant conflict than that,"" he said Friday in his 60-page ruling.

County Attorney Bill Montgomery said the judge's order does not specifically bar prosecutions of smugglers, but the top county prosecutor said he cannot ethically allow any prosecutions under the law because Broomfield's reasoning for his ruling may have broader implications. A lawyer for the county, Tim Casey, said it will ask Broomfield to clarify the scope of his ruling while the county considers whether to appeal.

Montgomery said the freeze applies until a federal court explicitly allows prosecutions under the smuggling law. Seventy-five percent of the approximately 1,800 people charged under the smuggling law in Maricopa County through June 2011 were facing counts of conspiring to sneak themselves into the country.

That drew complaints from immigrant rights advocates that the statute was intended for often violent smugglers, not their customers, and that the prosecution policy was preempted by federal immigration law.

While Brooke's $215 million profit for the quarter that ended June 30 produced earnings of $10.30 per share, investors aren't going to see that money. The company has already earmarked the $300 million for retiring Liggett and Brooke debt.

But even without money from the Philip Morris deal, Brooke's second quarter shows the company's operations are improving. The Miami-based company reported $116 million in revenues for the quarter compared with $111 million in revenues during the second quarter of 1998.

Liggett, which produces most of Brooke's income, reported revenues of $94 million for the second quarter of 1999 compared with $83.4 million during the second quarter of 1998. Liggett's operating income for the 1999 second quarter was $18 million, Brooke reported.

Earlier this year, Liggett announced its cigarette manufacturing operation was leaving Durham. In May, a Liggett subsidiary signed an agreement to purchase a facility in Mebane for $8.4 million, according to records Brooke filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Liggett and Brooke's revenues have been on the rise because of cigarette price increases tied to the $206 billion tobacco industry settlement with states that were suing the tobacco industry. But while the major cigarette makers have been raising prices to pay for the settlement, Brooke has been raising prices and pocketing the profit.

The two agencies insisted on the stance as a high delegation of the National Defense College of the United Arab Emirates (NDC-UAE) paid a courtesy visit to the country alongside an institutional briefing.  In an interview, PIA Director-General Ramon Cualoping III said national security risks are no longer limited to kinetic, but more of cognitive warfare. ‚ÄúCognitive so dapat naiintindihan ang mga proyekto, polisiya, programa ng pamahalaan. Kung hindi naiintindihan, nagkakaroon ng mistrust o pag-agam-agam, pagdududa sa ating pamahalaan. At kapag ‚Äòyan nangyari, magiging vulnerable ‚Äòyung ating mga kababayan para sa mga bagay which can affect national security (Cognitive, so the projects, policies and programs should be understood. If it‚Äôs misunderstood, there‚Äôs a mistrust, hesitations or doubts in our government. And once that happens, Filipinos shall be vulnerable to threats that may affect the national security),‚Äù he said.  Cualoping said although the government cannot dictate its people, explaining the administration‚Äôs program and projects is vital to ensure public trust.  ‚ÄúNgayon, cognitive na e. Meaning cerebral, kung paano mag-isip ang isang tao, kung ano ‚Äòyung thought process ng isang tao. That‚Äôs why dito sa PIA, gusto nating maging thought leaders ‚Äòyung mga kababayan natin (Nowadays it‚Äôs cognitive. Meaning cerebral, or how the people think, how a person has his thought process. That‚Äôs why here in PIA, we want our fellow Filipinos to be thought leaders),‚Äù he added.  On the other hand, the spread of inaccurate information may hinder the dissemination of administration‚Äôs programs that are supposedly beneficial for Filipinos.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs Twitter, Facebook, Tiktok, everything is there. Everyone has  a content producer or a creator. But now, the role of the government is to safeguard the entire state and the entire citizenry. Which means, whatever the government releases, the people should understand. Because the government has no program that will harm the people,‚Äù he said in mixed English and Filipino.  Moreover, NDCP acting Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean Dr. Alan Lachica said fake news or misinformation can turn down a government system.",7
