Speaking from experience, Pimentel said it was a challenge to handle his colleagues’ egos and interests.  “Mahina kasi ang party system natin. Wala namang party-backing ang ating mga leaders of Congress. Hindi by party e. At saka kung may party man sya, not sufficient in numbers.

Hence, it is imperative that concerns voiced by seafarers themselves, such as unreasonable fees, corruption in training and maritime schools, requirements, and others, be given greater consideration,” she said in a statement.   “It is also important to observe that the majority of negative findings were due to deficiencies in the education system. We call on the Commission on Higher Education and the MARINA (Maritime Industry Authority) to continue to remedy such deficiencies,” she added.   Hontiveros said she would continue to advocate for the passage of the Magna Carta of Seafarers to protect and advance the rights and well-being of seafarers.   Senator Grace Poe echoed the statement of Hontiveros, saying there should be continuous training to increase the viability of Filipino workers.   “The continued recognition by the European Union of the certificates for Filipino seafarers is a crucial decision that will keep them onboard ships. During this turbulent period of the global economy, we cannot afford job losses that will bring economic difficulties to millions of families,” Poe said in a separate statement.   “As Filipino seafarers remain the preferred choice in the EU region, we should embark on continuous skills training to increase the viability of our workers. The government and private sector should step up efforts to use the period allowed by the EU to boost training and seriously heed the issues raised by the European Maritime Safety Agency,” she added.   Poe said the quality of maritime education would ensure the safety of travelers and secure the future of Filipino seafarers’ families.   Senator Joel Villanueva said he trusted the country’s maritime authorities and that they will continue to enhance efforts to  with the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention).",6.

"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. said on Saturday he would not cooperate with the inquiry of the International Criminal Court (ICC) into the abuses in the campaign against illegal drugs of his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte.   Speaking to reporters in Baguio City, Marcos said his position on the ICC probe has not changed.   “I have stated it often, even before I took office as President, that there are many questions about their jurisdiction and what we in the Philippines regard as an intrusion into our internal matters and a threat to our sovereignty,” he said.   “So no, I do not see what their jurisdiction is. I feel that we have in our police, in our judiciary, a good system. We do not need assistance from any outside entity, the Philippines is a sovereign nation, and we are not colonies anymore of these former imperialists. So that is not something that we consider to be a legitimate judgment,” he added.   Marcos said that “until those questions of jurisdiction and the effects on the sovereignty of the Republic are sufficiently answered, I cannot cooperate with them.”   Duterte pulled the Philippines out of the Hague-based tribunal in 2019 after it began a preliminary probe into the crackdown, followed by the launch of a formal inquiry later that year.",13.

In a press conference, DepEd spokesperson Michael Poa said that although it is not illegal to join organizations, it is important to identify the organizations' nature.  ""No, we will not abridge the freedom of our teachers to join these organizations or for these organizations to conduct their activity whatever they want. But kahit papayagan natin sila sa activities nila dahil di naman natin sila mapipigilan (even if we allow them in their activities because we cannot stop them), we will not condone teachers  or engage in criminal activities,"" he said.  Officials discussed their stance on organizations like the ACT, which is said to be ""linked to underground mass organizations.""  ""That's why I call on the teachers, including those who are members of the ACT, to be more vigilant. They should be discriminating. And try to understand, evaluate them and check their profile for themselves, as to where their leaders are directing them. Listen to what they are saying,"" NTF-ELCAC executive director Ernesto Torres Jr. said.  Torres said that although the majority of ACT members are not part of the underground propaganda, the profile and intent of its core leaders must be tested.  ""Majority of them are not really aware that they are supporting the underground mass organization which is KaGuMa. KaGuMa is Katipunan ng mga Gurong Makabayan... Their core leaders in ACT, we can confidently say that they are part of KaGuMa, that they are party members of the CPP-NPA-NDF.

""PNRI has the equipment. We need their help because they know how to run these equipment. We have the technical capabilities and the experts,"" Phivolcs Director Teresito Bacolcol told the Philippine News Agency. Raymond Patrick Maximo, Phivolcs Science Research Specialist, said these equipment include Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy, X-ray Fluorescence, Fourier-transform Infrared Spectrometer, etc.  Bacolcol said the PNRI will place equipment on active faults to measure the radon gas. Phivolcs, on the other hand, will trace where these active faults are located.  He added that the partnership is essential also because the PNRI checks potential sites for nuclear power plants.  Meanwhile, according to Phivolcs, the two agencies will work on projects in the fields of geochemistry, isotopic techniques, volcanism, active faults, geothermal and volcano-hydrothermal. ""Isotopic techniques are ways to analyze isotopes. We would like to develop methods to measure isotopes in the substance. In the case of volcanoes, (we will) measure isotopes in volcanic deposits or rocks,"" Maximo told the PNA. Sulfur isotopes, for example, will tell whether there is new magma involved in a volcanic eruption, he said. Under the partnership, Phivolcs will provide technical support for fieldwork and sample collection. It will also facilitate data acquisition from local sources. Aside from coordinating with the PNRI for joint publication of study findings, the Phivolcs will also use the projects' output in future operations if isotopic techniques are proven accurate in identifying the movements of active faults.  The PNRI, on the other hand, will coordinate project activities with local officials and residents. The PNRI will regularly conduct radon and thoron measurements for monitoring the movements of active faults.  Among other activities, the PNRI will facilitate mineral chemistry, geochronological and geochemical analyses in partner institutions.",13. Political,2. Capacity and Resources,2.

""The DA-BFAR likewise found low-level contaminants or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in the fish samples. PAH, which is harmful to humans and other living organisms, may accumulate in the flesh of fish over time,"" it added.  The level is based on the gathered samples from March 3 to 14.  Amid the halt of fishing activities, the BFAR assured continuous aid to around 19,000 affected fishers.  ""The DA-BFAR has already allocated an initial budget of PHP6.4 million for livelihood and relief assistance to aid fisherfolk and their families cope with the loss of  due to fishing bans,"" it said.  Besides the distribution of food packs, a budget for the rehabilitation programs is also being prepared.  ""Rest assured that the DA-BFAR has been working with concerned national government agencies and LGUs to ensure public safety and address the concerns of over 19,000 affected fisherfolk,"" it added.  The DA-BFAR earlier turned over 10,000 canned goods, 5,000 noodles and a thousand 25-kg sacks of rice to the regional office of Mimaropa (Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon, and Palawan) intended to benefit around 5,000 families.  However, the BFAR said it shall still determine the status of food safety of the sea foods considering the initial data is ""not yet conclusive."" This, as the BFAR shall continue to evaluate the situation, especially now that the oil spill reached other bodies of water in nearby provinces.  ""Further sampling and analyses are being conducted to establish time-series results on the effect of the oil spill on fish concerning food safety, taking into account the magnitude of the oil spill which has reached neighboring areas like Caluya, Antique and some municipalities of Palawan,"" the BFAR said.  To date, fishing activities in Caluya, Antique are also halted following the spread of the oil spill.  On Feb. 28, the MT Princess Empress sank off the coast of Naujan town which caused the leakage of oil to the waters of Oriental Mindoro and to its nearby provinces.",1. Economic,10.

"MANILA – Many areas in the country will experience rain showers due to the northeast monsoon or ""amihan"" and the shear line, the weather bureau said Tuesday. Scattered rain showers and thunderstorms due to the shear line -- the convergence of cold and warm winds which trigger rains -- will prevail over Eastern Visayas, Caraga and Davao Oriental. The northeast monsoon will bring rain showers over Quezon and Bicol Region. These areas may experience flash floods or landslides due to moderate to heavy rains, Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said. Palawan and the rest of the Visayas and Mindanao will have isolated rain showers caused by localized thunderstorms.

"MANILA – The Philippines and the European Union (EU) on Monday launched the Copernicus Capacity Support Action Programme for the Philippines (CopPhil), a first in the region space cooperation program worth PHP610 million. Copernicus is the EU's earth observation flagship program that provides free environment and climate data derived from a constellation of satellites – the Sentinels -- which monitor the earth and its many ecosystems 24 hours daily. CopPhil seeks to aid Philippine authorities develop national systems to make use of EU’s earth observation’s satellites data in disaster mitigation and climate change adaptation and food security strategies. ""To be most effective in reducing disaster risk, an integrated systems approach to governance, featuring strong coordination and cooperation across sectors and levels is needed,"" said Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Secretary Renato Solidum Jr. during the launch in Pasay City.He added that if the country could prevent hazards from  disasters, it could also futureproof its development and economic gains.  Solidum said the demand for innovative approaches that can create disaster resilience have  bigger. The Philippines, for instance, is constantly confronted with climate and disaster risks, and is vulnerable to its impacts, he pointed out. ""CoPhil will develop and leverage our own Space Science and Technology applications to strengthen the nation’s resilience to disasters and climate change,” he said. He added that the agency has been utilizing Sentinel datasets for land cover mapping, aquaculture monitoring, and forest and watershed management monitoring around the Philippines. Using the Copernicus data collection system would support the Philippine government's decision-making and policy implementation monitoring based on timely and accurate data, Solidum said. He also said the data would help the government gain an improved understanding of hazards and risks from the space perspective, identify challenges and identify analysis tools to support planning and decision-making. For his part, EU Ambassador to the Philippines Luc  that the cooperation program will lead to ""a stronger and more shock-resilient Filipino economy and society."" Véron also said the EU is exploring the possibility to create a network of Copernicus partners in the Asean of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region aside from other parts of the world. ""The uptake of innovative technologies such as Copernicus will trigger growth, jobs and modernization of digital infrastructures that can be used in many sectors in the Philippines,” he said.  Philippine Space Agency Director General Joel Marciano Jr.  the partnership with the EU, saying it would boost the domestic space value chain, particularly in processing and using satellite images and space data.  ""CopPhil is an integral part of our efforts to mobilize space data for societal benefit and value, for strengthening the country's domestic space value chain, and for positioning the Philippines as a hub for space data mobilization excellence in the region,"" he said. Marciano cited as an example that PhilSA has provided Copernicus Sentinel data to the Department of Agriculture for road network monitoring, movement of goods, hazard mapping and ship detection. The open data from Copernicus, he said, has also enabled access to crucial data such as volcanic emission monitoring, mapping of canopy heights, crops, among others.",14.

"MANILA – The Department of Agriculture (DA) on Monday underscored the importance of food safety to public health, as it seized around PHP120 million worth of smuggled agri-fishery products in Navotas City.  In a radio-TV interview, DA Assistant Secretary for Inspectorate and Enforcement James Layug said the DA, together with partner agencies, inspected and raided seven warehouses in Navotas on March 17.  “‘Yung isang pinasok po natin, talyer po e. Pero sa loob niya, mayroong dalawang ‘yung plug-in na tinatawag. May container van sa loob na refrigerated tapos nakasaksak lang sa kuryente. Tapos sa loob naman, talagang gumawa lang ng kwarto tapos nilagyan ng mga refrigerated section  (One raided area is an auto garage shop. But inside, it has two so-called plug-ins. It has a refrigerated container van inside, plugged in electricity. Then inside, they made a room with a refrigerated section  he said.  Among the confiscated products include frozen pompano, pangasius, shrimp, chicken, frozen beef, frozen boneless beef, frozen spare ribs, frozen pork parts, frozen pork aorta, frozen squid rings and frozen pacific saury. However, Layug said more than the avoidance of necessary taxes and permits, the risk of having smuggled goods on the table is a health concern.  “Mas importante ay ‘yung food safety issue. Hindi ito dumaan sa tamang proseso. Hindi ho na-inspect o nabigyan ng sanitary phytosanitary clearance. So ang problema po natin dito is ‘pag napunta po ito sa public market o mga hapagkainan, danger ng public health issue (The food safety issue is more important. This is not undergoing the right process. It’s not inspected nor given sanitary phytosanitary clearance so our problem here is if it reaches the public market or the tables, the danger is a public health issue),” he said.  Layug added that this is possible since consumers do not usually search for the supply source when in the public market.  “May deception din ito. Kasi hindi naman ilalagay ‘yung ano e, kasi mga expired po ‘yung iba e. Ire-rebox lang nila ito, kapag ibinenta sa palengke, mga talipapa. Kung ikaw consumer, hindi mo naman na titingnan saan galing ito, titingnan mo kung mura (There’s a deception here because they are not putting (the expiration date), some are even expired. Others are just reboxed, then sold to markets. If you’re the consumer, you will no longer check where it came from. You will just look for cheaper prices),” he said.  To date, the DA will still look into the sources of the confiscated smuggled agri-fishery products.  Moreover, the DA said it will investigate possible diversion or technical smuggling after the seizure.",9. Health and Safety,"7. Law and Order, Crime and Justice",9. Health and Safety,9.

However, it will bring scattered rain showers and thunderstorms over mainland Cagayan, Isabela, Aurora, and Quezon.

Meanwhile, moderate to strong winds and moderate to tough seas will prevail across Luzon.

"MANILA – The Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) on Tuesday called on the farmers to practice efficient farming and the public to be wise in food consumption, as it braces for the possible agricultural effects of El Niño.  During the Laging Handa public briefing, BPI spokesperson Jose Diego Roxas assured that the Department of Agriculture (DA) is on top of the situation and the agencies are preparing for the possible effects of drought.  “Huwag pong mag-alala ang ating taumbayan… kami naman po ay nagpaplano nang maayos para ho malutas ang maaaring maging epekto ng El Niño (The public should not worry… we are properly planning to resolve the effects of El Niño),” he said.  Roxas said the DA is yet to specify its concrete steps as the plans are being finalized, but he cited the prepositioned support to farmers considering the possible impacts on vegetable crops.  “Nandiyan din po ang production support na doon po sa lugar na malubhang maaapektuhan po ng El Niño, mayroon pong mga buffer stock po ng seeds para po sa replanting kung kinakailangan (We also have the production support for areas that will be greatly affected by the El Niño, we have a buffer stock of seeds for replanting if needed),” he said.  He added that agricultural areas that are more likely to be less affected by drought will be strengthened to increase production to cover for the possible yield decline in the vulnerable areas.  Roxas also underscored the need for efficient irrigation and farming.  “The bottom line is the efficient use of natural resources like water, fertilizer, chemicals and others. It’s better that our farming will be precise. This means the utilization of resources or input should be just enough, nothing more, nothing less,” he added.  He said farmers may likewise opt to plant climate-smart varieties during El Niño using breeders-developed vegetables, corn and palay that can survive even with less water allocation amid increased heat.  Meanwhile, Roxas also urged the public to take part in the preparation to help farmers and authorities.  “Bilang tulong na lang din po ‘no, tamang consumption po ng ating mga pagkain nang sa ganoon, mabawasan po natin iyong mga sayang dulot po ng labis po na pagkonsumo ng pagkain (To help, we should have proper consumption of food so that we can prevent wastage due to excessive food consumption),” he added.",9.

"MANILA – The Philippine Information Agency (PIA), in partnership with the National Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP) of the Department of National Defense (DND), has underscored the importance of disseminating government policies and programs  the spread of fake news and misinformation and uphold national security.  The two agencies insisted on the stance as a high delegation of the National Defense College of the United Arab Emirates (NDC-UAE) paid a courtesy visit to the country alongside an institutional briefing.  In an interview, PIA Director-General Ramon Cualoping III said national security risks are no longer limited to kinetic, but more of cognitive warfare. “Cognitive so dapat naiintindihan ang mga proyekto, polisiya, programa ng pamahalaan. Kung hindi naiintindihan, nagkakaroon ng mistrust o pag-agam-agam, pagdududa sa ating pamahalaan. At kapag ‘yan nangyari, magiging vulnerable ‘yung ating mga kababayan para sa mga bagay which can affect national security (Cognitive, so the projects, policies and programs should be understood. If it’s misunderstood, there’s a mistrust, hesitations or doubts in our government. And once that happens, Filipinos shall be vulnerable to threats that may affect the national security),” he said.  Cualoping said although the government cannot dictate its people, explaining the administration’s program and projects is vital to ensure public trust.  “Ngayon, cognitive na e. Meaning cerebral, kung paano mag-isip ang isang tao, kung ano ‘yung thought process ng isang tao. That’s why dito sa PIA, gusto nating maging thought leaders ‘yung mga kababayan natin (Nowadays it’s cognitive. Meaning cerebral, or how the people think, how a person has his thought process. That’s why here in PIA, we want our fellow Filipinos to be thought leaders),” he added.  On the other hand, the spread of inaccurate information may hinder the dissemination of administration’s programs that are supposedly beneficial for Filipinos.  “There’s Twitter, Facebook, Tiktok, everything is there. Everyone has  a content producer or a creator. But now, the role of the government is to safeguard the entire state and the entire citizenry. Which means, whatever the government releases, the people should understand. Because the government has no program that will harm the people,” he said in mixed English and Filipino.  Moreover, NDCP acting Vice President for Academic Affairs and Dean Dr. Alan Lachica said fake news or misinformation can turn down a government system.",13. Political,8. Security and Defense,8.

[That includes] our distribution of machinery not only for production but also for post-harvest facilities),” she said.  Evangelista cited various challenges that contributed to the rising farm-gate and market prices, including higher cost of agricultural inputs and climate change. According to Samahang Industriya ng Agrikultura (SINAG), the Philippines is not the lone country affected by the mounting production cost, but also other rice-producing nations.  “So kung makita natin doon sa merkado, ‘yung presyo ng local natin, tumaas na rin ‘yung presyo, pero mas mataas pa rin ‘yung imported. Nakita natin ‘yung Thailand, Vietnam and itong India, and Pakistan, tumaas din ang presyo.
