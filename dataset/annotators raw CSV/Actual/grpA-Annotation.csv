Speaking from experience, Pimentel said it was a challenge to handle his colleagues’ egos and interests.  “Mahina kasi ang party system natin. Wala namang party-backing ang ating mga leaders of Congress. Hindi by party e. At saka kung may party man sya, not sufficient in numbers.

"Senators on Saturday called for continuous skills training and industry-wide reforms following the European Union's (EU) decision to continue recognizing the certificates for seafarers issued by the Philippines.   Senator Risa  the government agencies for their efforts and hoped that serious reforms would be put into place.   “Let us continue to push for industry-wide reforms. Kailangang may natutunan sa naging banta sa hanapbuhay ng ating seafarers (We must learn from this threat to the livelihood of our seafarers). Hence, it is imperative that concerns voiced by seafarers themselves, such as unreasonable fees, corruption in training and maritime schools, requirements, and others, be given greater consideration,” she said in a statement.   “It is also important to observe that the majority of negative findings were due to deficiencies in the education system. We call on the Commission on Higher Education and the MARINA (Maritime Industry Authority) to continue to remedy such deficiencies,” she added.   Hontiveros said she would continue to advocate for the passage of the Magna Carta of Seafarers to protect and advance the rights and well-being of seafarers.   Senator Grace Poe echoed the statement of Hontiveros, saying there should be continuous training to increase the viability of Filipino workers.   “The continued recognition by the European Union of the certificates for Filipino seafarers is a crucial decision that will keep them onboard ships. During this turbulent period of the global economy, we cannot afford job losses that will bring economic difficulties to millions of families,” Poe said in a separate statement.   “As Filipino seafarers remain the preferred choice in the EU region, we should embark on continuous skills training to increase the viability of our workers. The government and private sector should step up efforts to use the period allowed by the EU to boost training and seriously heed the issues raised by the European Maritime Safety Agency,” she added.   Poe said the quality of maritime education would ensure the safety of travelers and secure the future of Filipino seafarers’ families.   Senator Joel Villanueva said he trusted the country’s maritime authorities and that they will continue to enhance efforts to  with the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention).",6.

"President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. said on Saturday he would not cooperate with the inquiry of the International Criminal Court (ICC) into the abuses in the campaign against illegal drugs of his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte.   Speaking to reporters in Baguio City, Marcos said his position on the ICC probe has not changed.   “I have stated it often, even before I took office as President, that there are many questions about their jurisdiction and what we in the Philippines regard as an intrusion into our internal matters and a threat to our sovereignty,” he said.   “So no, I do not see what their jurisdiction is. I feel that we have in our police, in our judiciary, a good system. We do not need assistance from any outside entity, the Philippines is a sovereign nation, and we are not colonies anymore of these former imperialists. So that is not something that we consider to be a legitimate judgment,” he added.   Marcos said that “until those questions of jurisdiction and the effects on the sovereignty of the Republic are sufficiently answered, I cannot cooperate with them.”   Duterte pulled the Philippines out of the Hague-based tribunal in 2019 after it began a preliminary probe into the crackdown, followed by the launch of a formal inquiry later that year.",13.
