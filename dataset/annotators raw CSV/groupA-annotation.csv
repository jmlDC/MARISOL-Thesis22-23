Kailangang may natutunan sa naging banta sa hanapbuhay ng ating seafarers (We must learn from this threat to the livelihood of our seafarers). Hence, it is imperative that concerns voiced by seafarers themselves, such as unreasonable fees, corruption in training and maritime schools, requirements, and others, be given greater consideration,” she said in a statement.   “It is also important to observe that the majority of negative findings were due to deficiencies in the education system. We call on the Commission on Higher Education and the MARINA (Maritime Industry Authority) to continue to remedy such deficiencies,” she added.   Hontiveros said she would continue to advocate for the passage of the Magna Carta of Seafarers to protect and advance the rights and well-being of seafarers.   Senator Grace Poe echoed the statement of Hontiveros, saying there should be continuous training to increase the viability of Filipino workers.   “The continued recognition by the European Union of the certificates for Filipino seafarers is a crucial decision that will keep them onboard ships. During this turbulent period of the global economy, we cannot afford job losses that will bring economic difficulties to millions of families,” Poe said in a separate statement.   “As Filipino seafarers remain the preferred choice in the EU region, we should embark on continuous skills training to increase the viability of our workers. The government and private sector should step up efforts to use the period allowed by the EU to boost training and seriously heed the issues raised by the European Maritime Safety Agency,” she added.   Poe said the quality of maritime education would ensure the safety of travelers and secure the future of Filipino seafarers’ families.   Senator Joel Villanueva said he trusted the country’s maritime authorities and that they will continue to enhance efforts to  with the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention).",

I feel that we have in our police, in our judiciary, a good system. We do not need assistance from any outside entity, the Philippines is a sovereign nation, and we are not colonies anymore of these former imperialists. So that is not something that we consider to be a legitimate judgment,” he added.   Marcos said that “until those questions of jurisdiction and the effects on the sovereignty of the Republic are sufficiently answered, I cannot cooperate with them.”   Duterte pulled the Philippines out of the Hague-based tribunal in 2019 after it began a preliminary probe into the crackdown, followed by the launch of a formal inquiry later that year.",
