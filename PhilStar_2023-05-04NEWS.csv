0,Comelec seeks budget for hybrid count machines,Evelyn Macairan - The Philippine Star This content was originally published by The Philippine Star following its editorial guidelines. Philstar.com hosts its content but has no editorial control over it.,"May 5, 202","MANILA, Philippines — To prevent a repeat of machine malfunctions during previous elections, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) is hoping to gain the support of the executive and legislative branches in purchasing a new election system.
For the 2025 midterm polls, the Comelec is preparing a two-year budgetary plan, with the one for 2024 to cover the preparatory stage and the one for 2025 covering the election proper.
Comelec Chairman George Garcia has yet to reveal the commission’s proposed budget.
He has come up with a “wish list” of features in the automated counting machines (ACMs) that they would want to use in the 2025 midterm polls.
Garcia yesterday presented the terms of reference for a new automated election system that include having “hybrid” ACMs that are equipped with both Optical Mark Reader (OMR) and Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) capability.
The OMR can be used for domestic elections while the DRE could be used for overseas voting.
An OMR allows voters to vote using a paper ballot, which is then counted by machines while DRE only allows voters to vote using a touch screen or touch pad.
The commission also prefers machines that allow votes to be verifiable through the display screen of at least 12 inches and voter’s receipt; that have ballot images (front and back) scanned, captured and read while successively displayed on the screen and showing the votes obtained by each candidate; that could verify a vote using a voter’s receipt that would automatically be cut by the printer; and the machines have a ballot scanning speed of 200mm/sec. which is faster than the old machine that is only capable of 70 mm/sec.
In the new system, the Comelec prefers using a stamping pen instead of a marking pen.
Should they fail to get the needed budget to cover the purchase of a new election system, Garcia said they face the worst-case scenario of reusing the vote counting machines, which they have already declared to be “unusable,” and could end up with more problems.
“We would have to withdraw the term ‘unusable’ and use the 98,000 ACMs and have them refurbished,” Garcia added.
These 98,000 ACMs have been in use since the 2016 elections. During the 2022 presidential elections, there were 1,600 ACMs – less than one percent of the 107,000 precincts – that broke down.
“How much more if more than one-half of machines will fail because of their age in 2025, that is the worst-case scenario,” Garcia added.
In 2025, the Comelec is expecting 71 million voters and would require an estimated 127,000 machines to be used in the 127,000 polling precincts.

1,"Philippines, US to increase tempo of sea activities",Alexis Romero - The Philippine Star This content was originally published by The Philippine Star following its editorial guidelines. Philstar.com hosts its content but has no editorial control over it.,"May 5, 202","WASHINGTON – The Philippines has agreed to an “increased tempo” of maritime activities like joint patrols with the United States in the South China Sea, as Beijing resorts to more assertive actions in the disputed waters, the US defense chief revealed on Wednesday.
In a meeting at the Pentagon, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin III assured President Marcos that the US will always have the Philippines’ back, being not just an “indispensable friend and ally” of the US but also “family” with a common vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region.
“As (US) President (Joe) Biden has made clear, our commitment to the defense of the Philippines is ironclad,” Austin said. “So make no mistake, Mr. President, we will always have your back, in the South China Sea or elsewhere in the region.”
Austin reiterated that the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) signed by the two countries in 1951 applies to armed attacks on their armed forces, coast guard vessels, public vessels, or aircraft in the Pacific including in the South China Sea.
In response, Marcos said the Philippines and the US enjoy a “longstanding and very robust” relationship and that the call of the times is for them to meet challenges they have not faced before.
Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said Marcos and Austin talked about conducting joint patrols in the South China Sea and reaffirmed their resolve to defend against armed attacks on their aircraft, public vessels and armed forces, including their respective coast guards, in the Pacific.
“The two leaders underscored their shared desire to deepen bilateral planning and operational cooperation including an increased tempo of combined maritime activities, such as joint patrols, to support the Philippines’ lawful exercise of its rights in the South China Sea,” Ryder said in a statement.
Last month, the Department of Foreign Affairs called on China to respect the Philippines’ rights over the South China Sea following a near collision between a Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) ship and a Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) vessel in the West Philippine Sea.
Now, barely two weeks after that incident in the vicinity of Ayungin Shoal, more than a hundred Chinese ships remain in the West Philippine Sea.
At the Pentagon, Marcos and Austin lauded the conclusion of new US-Philippines bilateral defense guidelines, which “chart their vision for alliance cooperation across all operational domains.”
The guidelines aim to modernize the alliance cooperation between Manila and Washington in line with their shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region.
Among the objectives of the guidelines is to deepen the interoperability between the militaries of the two countries, which involves expanding cooperation on maritime security and maritime domain awareness.
Before the meeting, Marcos was given full honors at the Pentagon, making him the first foreign head of state to receive such a treatment at the US defense department’s headquarters under the Biden administration.
A joint statement of the US-Philippines 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue issued last month said the Philippines and the US have agreed to “finalize plans for the resumption of combined maritime activities, including the conduct of joint sails by the US and Philippine navies, in the South China Sea.”
The two countries also tackled plans to hold multilateral maritime activities with other like-minded partners in the South China Sea this year.
The Philippines and China are embroiled in a maritime row over portions of the South China Sea, a busy sea lane widely perceived to be a stage of the rivalry between Washington and Beijing in the region.
China, which claims virtually the entire South China Sea, has drawn flak from the US and other countries over the frequent harassment by the CCG of Philippine vessels and fishing boats in disputed waters.
The Pentagon said Marcos and Austin had also discussed plans to “swiftly operationalize” the four new sites of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) in northern Luzon and Palawan.
Signed in 2014, the EDCA grants the US military access to Philippine bases for training, prepositioning of equipment, and humanitarian efforts.
The four new EDCA sites are Naval Base Camilo Osias in Santa Ana, Cagayan; Camp Melchor dela Cruz in Gamu, Isabela; Balabac Island in Palawan; and Lal-lo Airport in Cagayan.
Finally, Austin reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to bolstering Manila’s military defense capabilities, which involves the transfer of several American defense platforms to support the modernization efforts of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).
A White House statement said the US plans to transfer to the AFP two Island-class patrol vessels, two Protector-class patrol vessels, and three C-130H aircraft, pending applicable congressional notification requirements.
Marcos and Austin also talked about ways to coordinate more closely with like-minded nations, including Australia and Japan, to “strengthen shared principles, including the rule of law, freedom of the seas, and respect for territorial sovereignty.”
The Philippine Air Force (PAF) FA-50 fighter jets and the F-16 fighter planes of the United States Air Force (USAF) have commenced joint air-to-air training activities in Pampanga.
A military statement said the joint air-to-air training at Clark Air Base, Mabalacat City, Pampanga is part of the ongoing COPE-THUNDER 23-1 exercise that involves over 400 PAF airmen and 160 USAF service members.
The aim of the Counter Air training mission of the 5th Fighter Wing with the 14th Fighter Squadron of the Pacific Air Forces is to improve interoperability between the two air forces by undertaking integration flights on various air-to-air combat scenarios.
“The strategy and tactics learned during this training can be utilized by our security force across multiple spectrums of warfighting especially in compressed hostile environments,” said PAF spokesperson Col. Ma. Consuelo Castillo.
Also, the 544th Security Forces Squadron under the 5th Fighter Wing of the PAF and their US counterparts conducted a Subject Matter Expert Exchange on Close Quarter Combat operations at the Basa Air Base in Floridablanca, Pampanga.
The exercise began on Monday, two days after the closing of this year’s biggest ever Balikatan exercises that involved 17,600 Filipino and American troops.
Castillo revealed that CT-Ph23-1 and CT-Ph23-2 are the two iterations of Cope Thunder for 2023 with the first already in motion and the second to be held from July 2 to 21.  – Evelyn Macairan, Michael Punongbayan

2,Airlines ready for May 17 airspace closure,Elijah Felice Rosales - The Philippine Star This content was originally published by The Philippine Star following its editorial guidelines. Philstar.com hosts its content but has no editorial control over it.,"May 5, 202","MANILA, Philippines — Airlines have started rescheduling flights that will be hit by the six-hour shutdown of Philippine airspace on May 17, with authorities trying to shorten the period of travel disruption to mitigate the impact.
Cebu Pacific spokesman Carmina Romero told The STAR that the low-cost carrier would come out with a travel advisory as soon as all the flights that will be affected are identified.
“We are still assessing, (but we) will release an advisory on the impact on our flight schedules,” Romero said, adding that Cebu Pacific, which flies an average of 2,600 trips per week, would send out an advisory at least a week before May 17.
For Philippine Airlines, spokesman Cielo Villaluna said the flag carrier is preparing its own advisory for the hours-long disruption and would release this once ready.
As for AirAsia Philippines, spokesman Steve Dailisan said the maintenance of air traffic control systems would disrupt at least 40 of the airline’s flights.
“The repair of the CNS-ATM (Communications, Navigation and Surveillance-Air Traffic Management) system is a positive development towards ensuring safer skies for all, especially within the Philippine Flight Information Region. AirAsia Philippines is expressing its support to our industry partners in this crucial exercise. We’ve been working closely with them since the beginning to mitigate any inconvenience among our guests. This involves our request with the slot committee for the retiming of our flights that will be affected due to the repair,” Dailisan said
This early, AirAsia Philippines moved to another date its flights to Taipei, Incheon, Bangkok and Kota Kinabalu, as well as domestic flights to Cebu, Bacolod, Davao, Puerto Princesa, Cagayan de Oro, Iloilo and Tacloban.
It also cancelled the flights from Manila to Davao, Cebu and Bacolod, including their return flights, to make way for the airspace shutdown.
The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) hopes to cut the maintenance period, which is to run between midnight and six in the morning, to less than six hours to minimize the impact on travel and trade.
During the period, CAAP aims to upgrade its air traffic management system and repair electrical equipment to prevent a repeat of the airspace shutdown last Jan. 1 and the power outage last May 1, both of which disrupted the flights of tens of thousands of passengers.
The Manila International Airport Authority projects some 130 flights with about 20,000 passengers will be disrupted by the resulting closure of local airspace during the maintenance period.
Eric Apolonio, CAAP spokesman, said a Notice to Airmen would be issued and that the public would be informed of the corrective maintenance activity at the Philippine Air Traffic Management Center on May 17.
Meanwhile, the Office of the Ombudsman said it exercised “due diligence and impartiality” in ordering the six-month preventive suspension of Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) general manager Cesar Chiong over a recent power interruption at the country’s flagship airport.
“The Office bases its decisions, orders and resolutions from the evidence on record and exercises due diligence and impartiality in passing upon facts which are relevant or material to the case,” the ombudsman said in a statement yesterday.
Ombudsman Samuel Martires, in an order dated April 28, authorized the suspension without pay of Chiong and Irene Montalbo, MIAA acting assistant general manager for finance and administration, over administrative complaints of grave abuse of authority, grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.
The complaints, filed before the ombudsman by MIAA officials who requested anonymity, stemmed from Chiong’s reassignment of 285 employees allegedly without providing them any reason for doing so. The complainants said Chiong also designated Montalbo as acting assistant general manager despite her unsatisfactory rating.
In its suspension order, the ombudsman said that “based on the evidence on record, it appears that the evidence of guilt of the respondents are strong and the charge against them involves grave misconduct which may warrant their removal from the service.”
Chiong, in a statement on Tuesday, said he is confident he would be cleared after he presents his side, noting that he has yet to see the complaint and be given a chance to respond to the charges.
While the suspension order was signed by Martires on April 28, its was made public only on Tuesday, a day after the May 1 power outage at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3 that stranded thousands of passengers.
The MIAA had earlier stated that it was not ruling out the possibility of sabotage as reason for the NAIA-3 power outage supposedly to embarrass the government and the MIAA leadership.
MIAA senior assistant general manager Bryan Co, on Wednesday, was named as MIAA’s officer-in-charge following Chiong’s preventive suspension. – Rudy Santos, Elizabeth Marcelo

3,Two DepEd admin officials resign; Ablan says quitting not related to laptops controversy,Cristina Chi - Philstar.com,"May 4, 20","MANILA, Philippines — Two Department of Education officials connected to the delivery of administrative services have tendered their resignations, but one undersecretary clarified that the move was not connected to the controversy on laptop purchases of the agency.
DepEd Undersecretary for Administration Kris Ablan confirmed in a message to Philstar.com that he resigned from his post on April 28, but the reason for doing so ""has nothing to do with the laptop or Transpac reports of Rappler,"" Ablan said. 
""In due time, I will answer point by point the issues raised by those reports in order to clear my name,"" Ablan added.
Ablan is among the two DepEd officials mentioned in reports published by Rappler on May 1 that revealed, among others, the department's unpaid fees to logistics partner Transpac Cargo Logistics Inc., which it contracted to distribute billions worth of DepEd technology and materials nationwide.
Another source has confirmed that Assistant Secretary Christopher Lawrence Arnuco, who is in charge of administrative services, has also resigned.
DepEd spokesperson Michael Poa did not respond to Philstar.com’s request for confirmation.
DepEd faced scrutiny at the Senate late last year for buying allegedly overpriced laptops, with the powerful Senate Blue Committee eventually recommending charges against officials from DepEd and from other government agencies who signed off on the purchase.
DepEd later created a separate strand—or division—in charge of procurement. 
Previously, it was DepEd’s administration strand—which former undersecretary Alain Pascua led—that was solely responsible for all matters related to the procurement of supplies and equipment for schools and education personnel, among others. 
In February, DepEd confirmed that the laptops being sold at a surplus store in Cebu, although not among those procured by the Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management, were part of the DepEd Computerization Program—an initiative under the administrative strand when it was headed by Pascua.
Pascua is among the education department officials that the Senate blue ribbon committee recommended to be charged over the procurement of overpriced laptops.
Ablan replaced Pascua at the turn of the new administration under Vice President Sara Duterte, concurrently DepEd secretary, in 2022.
Among the other programs handled by the administrative strand are its School Building Program, DepEd TV and DepEd Commons.
DepEd spokesperson Michael Poa said in February that it will refer to the Office of Solicitor General for evaluation and appropriate action regarding the recommendation of the blue ribbon committee to file criminal and administrative cases against past and present officials of DepEd.

4,42% want ROTC to be optional – SWS,Janvic Mateo - The Philippine Star This content was originally published by The Philippine Star following its editorial guidelines. Philstar.com hosts its content but has no editorial control over it.,"May 5, 202","MANILA, Philippines — More Filipinos prefer an optional Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) program instead of making it mandatory in senior high school (SHS), a recent survey conducted by the Social Weather Stations (SWS) showed.
Results of the March 26 to 29 survey released yesterday showed that only 35 percent of the respondents aged 18 and above want ROTC to be mandatory in SHS.
Some 42 percent said it should be optional and that students should be able to choose between ROTC or community service, while 22 percent said ROTC should not be in the curriculum of the students at all.
Although it was initially planned to be included in SHS, proponents later agreed to push for the return of mandatory ROTC in college.
Last month, the office of Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian released the results of a commissioned Pulse Asia survey, conducted from March 15 to 19, which showed 80 percent of respondents supporting mandatory ROTC in college.
Some, however, have questioned the framing of that survey’s question, which started with a positive description of ROTC before enumerating the concerns of those who oppose it.
It read, “The ROTC or Reserve Officers’ Training Corps is a program which aims to teach the youth about discipline and love of country through military training. They will also learn about leadership and patriotism. Some of those who oppose ROTC say that it only leads to bad experiences such as hazing, abuse, harassment and corruption in schools. How much do you agree or disagree with the proposal to implement ROTC to all students in college?”
In contrast, SWS simply provided the respondents with three statements and asked them to identify which is closest to their opinion of ROTC.
The statements used by SWS were: “ROTC should be compulsory course for Senior High School Students in Grade 11 and 12,” “ROTC should not be in the curriculum of students” and “ROTC should be optional where one can choose this as a course or choose community service.”
Based on the SWS survey, which is non-commissioned, support for compulsory ROTC in SHS was highest among respondents in the Visayas at 46 percent followed by those in Mindanao at 34 percent, balance Luzon at 32 percent and Metro Manila at 29 percent.
Those who said it should be optional were highest among respondents in balance Luzon at 47 percent, closely followed by Metro Manila at 46 percent, Mindanao at 42 percent and the Visayas at 28 percent.
Some 25 percent of respondents based in Metro Manila and the Visayas said ROTC should not be in the curriculum of the students, followed by 22 percent in Mindanao and 21 percent in balance Luzon.
The First Quarter 2023 SWS survey had 1,200 respondents and a sampling error margin of +/-2.8 percent.

5,"UP Baguio, Cebu suspend face-to-face classes due to COVID-19",Janvic Mateo - The Philippine Star This content was originally published by The Philippine Star following its editorial guidelines. Philstar.com hosts its content but has no editorial control over it.,"May 4, 202","MANILA, Philippines — The University of the Philippines campuses in Baguio City (UPB) and Cebu suspended face-to-face classes this week due to a spike in COVID cases.
In a memorandum, UPB vice chancellor for academic affairs Rosemary Gutierrez said 21 COVID cases had been reported at the university as of April 29.
“All cases have been reported to the City Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit. The infected individuals have been advised to undergo isolation for seven days and self-monitoring for close contacts,” read the memorandum.
“This is to allow those who have been exposed to the virus to complete their incubation period and prevent further transmission within the campus. We understand that this may inconvenience some of our students, but the safety of our community is our top priority,” the memo added.
Gutierrez advised UPB faculty members to prepare and deliver their asynchronous classes from May 2 to 5.
“Please observe all safety precautionary measures and avoid crowd-gathering activities during this time for a safer UPB campus,” she said.
The UPB library said it would implement limited face-to-face service during the period, with priority given to thesis writers.
UPB said Baguio is classified as “medium risk” for COVID, with an average one to seven new infections daily per 100,000 people.
Starting tomorrow, UP Cebu will shift to online classes amid the increasing cases of COVID on campus.
UP Cebu chancellor Leo Malagar said the transition to online instruction applies to all courses, except those requiring access to laboratories or studios and the high school program.
Malagar said the university would resume in-person classes on May 11.
UP Los Baños, meanwhile, said it would resume COVID booster vaccination as COVID cases continue to increase nationwide.
The Department of Health (DOH) sees no need for the national government to impose mandatory implementation of blended learning amid a spike in COVID cases nationwide.
Health officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire, who chairs the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF), said at a press briefing on Tuesday that it is up to local government units (LGUs) and school officials to “assess if they can manage,” for example if students do not get infected despite rising cases.
Based on the recommendation of the IATF, Vergeire said LGUs or the schools have the authority to decide whether there is a need to transition to distance learning.
She said the Department of Education (DepEd) and Commission on Higher Education have supervision over the schools.
The DepEd in Bicol region previously allowed schools to return to blended learning due to the increasing number of COVID cases.
Meanwhile, Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian urged school administrators to implement blended learning to protect students from extreme heat.
Gatchalian, chairman of the Senate committee on basic education, made the call after the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration issued an El Niño alert.
“It is the responsibility of school principals to ensure the welfare of our students,” he said.
Gatchalian also proposed to revert to the April to May summer break as the state weather bureau said El Niño may persist until 2024.
DepEd earlier reported that some schools have been implementing blended learning amid the extreme heat. – Mayen Jaymalin, Cecille Suerte Felipe

6,"2 police generals, 2 colonels recommended for drug raps",Emmanuel Tupas - The Philippine Star This content was originally published by The Philippine Star following its editorial guidelines. Philstar.com hosts its content but has no editorial control over it.,"May 3, 202","MANILA, Philippines — Four ranking police officials have been recommended to be removed from the Philippine National Police (PNP) due to alleged involvement in illegal drug activities.
A five-member advisory panel headed by former PNP chief Rodolfo Azurin Jr. recommended the acceptance of the courtesy resignations of the third-level officials, including two one-star generals and two colonels.
The four were among the 953 third-level officers evaluated by the panel after they submitted their courtesy resignations.
The panel cleared 917 of them, while it endorsed the suspension of President Marcos’ disposition on the 32 officers.
The STAR opted not to reveal the names of the officials as the National Police Commission (Napolcom) has yet to resolve the administrative cases filed against them.
Marcos, being the country’s Chief Executive, will have the final say on the matter.
The four had one thing in common: they were once assigned at the PNP Drug Enforcement Group (PDEG).
The panel endorsed the filing of administrative charges against the officials before the Napolcom for violation of the PNP’s rules and regulations against illegal drugs.
“The panel is of the opinion that there is sufficient basis to recommend the acceptance of their courtesy resignations,” Azurin said in a letter to Marcos, which was coursed through Interior and Local Government Secretary Benhur Abalos.
A copy of the letter was seen by The STAR.
Azurin asked Marcos to “withhold action on the courtesy resignations pending the final resolution of the cases filed against the officials.”
“The ad hoc advisory group urged the Napolcom to immediately act on and dispose of the cases to be filed against the PNP officers and put them on preventive suspension during the pendency of the cases,” Azurin said.
Aside from Azurin, the other members of the panel are Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong, ex-defense secretary Gilbert Teodoro, retired police general Isagani Nerez and former Court of Appeals associate justice Melchor Sadang.
The STAR tried but failed to obtain the comment of one of the officials.
Azurin’s successor, PNP chief Gen. Benjamin Acorda Jr., earlier said they would only make public the names of the police officials once charges are filed against them.

7,Over 150 Filipinos evacuated from Sudan to arrive on May 4,Philstar.com,"May 2, 20","MANILA, Philippines — More Filipinos who were evacuated from Sudan are expected to arrive back home this week, the Department of Migrant Workers said Tuesday.
Two groups of 80 and 72 overseas Filipino workers will be on commercial flights through Saudia Airlines on Wednesday and are expected to arrive the next day. They were part of the 340 OFWs assisted by the Philippine government in crossing to Agreen Land Port Authority in Aswan, Egypt from Sudan Port. 
The two flights will travel to Manila from Jeddah and Riyadh. The DMW said Overseas Workers Welfare Administrator Arnell Ignacio will be on one of the flights. 
“For this week, we will have 152 arriving on May 4 from Egypt and another bigger batch of OFWs from Sudan coming home hopefully via a chartered Philippine Airlines flight,” Migrant Workers Secretary Susan “Toots” Ople said in a statement. 
The DMW said it is trying to “negotiate” a chartered flight with PAL to bring home 188 other OFWs from the group of 340. On top of that, another group of 104 OFWs are expected to be repatriated home after they get cleared with the Egyptian border.

8,DILG identifies alternative fishing sites for Oriental Mindoro fishers,Gaea Katreena Cabico - Philstar.com,"May 4, 20","MANILA, Philippines — The Department of the Interior and Local Government said Thursday that it has identified alternative fishing grounds for fisherfolk in Oriental Mindoro affected by the oil spill.
In a release, DILG said its chief Benhur Abalos Jr. had recommended to President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. the sharing of fishing areas to oil spill-hit fishers. It has been two months since MT Princess Empress, which was loaded with 800,000 liters of industrial oil, sank off Oriental Mindoro.
Fishers from San Teodoro and Baco towns may do their fishing activities in the municipal waters of Paluan and Abra De Ilog in Occidental Mindoro, and Tayabas Bay and Mindoro Strait.
Those from Calapan City, Naujan, and Pola may catch fish in the municipal waters of Boac and Gasan in Marinduque, and in Tayabas Bay.
Meanwhile, fishers from Pinamalayan, Gloria and Bansud can fish in the municipal waters of Concepcion in Romblon and portions of Mindoro Strait.
Affected fisherfolk from Bongabong, Roxas, Mansalay and Bulalacao may do their fishing activities in Tablas Strait and the municipal waters of San Jose and Magsaysay in Occidental Mindoro.
However, the duration of fishing ground sharing is still uncertain, according to Abalos.
“As soon as the fish samples are okay and there is no more contamination of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the affected areas of Oriental Mindoro, fisherfolk can already do their fishing activities in their own territorial waters,” he said. PAHs are a group of chemicals present in crude oil.
The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources last week recommended keeping fishing bans in oil spill-affected areas in Oriental Mindoro as results of its analyses were not yet conclusive as far as food safety was concerned.
Oriental Mindoro fishers affected by the oil spill—estimated to be more than 26,000—are losing around P19 million per day.
Fishers who were ordered to stay ashore participate in the government’s cash-for-work program, which provides temporary income. 
The DILG also said that it will review existing policies on the management of municipal waters and urged coastal towns to include oil spill in their contingency plans.

9,Government printer to produce driver’s license cards,Bella Cariaso - The Philippine Star This content was originally published by The Philippine Star following its editorial guidelines. Philstar.com hosts its content but has no editorial control over it.,"May 4, 202","MANILA, Philippines — To speed up the release of plastic driver’s license cards while at the same time cutting cost, the Department of Transportation is tapping the National Printing Office (NPO) to produce the cards, DOTr Secretary Jaime Bautista disclosed yesterday.
Under the deal, the NPO will produce an initial five million plastic driver’s license cards for delivery to the Land Transportation Office (LTO) within 60 days, Bautista told The STAR.
Bautista met last Tuesday with NPO director Carlos Bathan at the DOTr main office to discuss the government agency-to-agency emergency procurement.
Bautista gave Bathan the terms of reference (TOR), and the NPO chief said he would submit the final proposal within the week.
Last Jan. 25, Bautista had issued a special order “in the exigency and best interest of the service,” requiring all procurements above P50 million in the department and its sectoral offices – including the LTO and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board – to be handled by the DOTr’s central bids and awards committee (CBAC).
The CBAC conducts competitive bidding that is recorded and streamed online.
Last month, LTO chief Jose Arturo Tugade said the agency would run out of plastic cards by the end of April because of the delayed procurement, which LTO officials blamed on the DOTr order.
License plates were also running out, the LTO said.
Amid concerns raised by motorists, Tugade announced the extension up to Oct. 31 this year of the validity of all driver’s license cards expiring by April 24.
On the other hand, a timeline of the license card procurement prepared by the DOTr showed that the LTO had a window for early procurement of the plastic cards between Aug. 22 last year, when the proposed national expenditure program for 2023 was submitted by Malacañang to Congress, and Dec. 16 when the General Appropriations Act was enacted, allocating over P541.5 million for the procurement.
But the early procurement was not done.
Before the special order was issued, the DOTr had allowed 18 procurement deals already being handled for the LTO by the controversial Procurement Service of the Department of the Budget and Management to proceed.
The LTO submitted to the DOTr the initial terms of reference (TOR) for bidding for the license cards on March 21 this year. After a review of the TOR and two pre-procurement conferences with the CBAC on March 27 and 29, the DOTr posted the bidding documents on April 4. A pre-bidding conference was held on April 12.
Industry sources said some prospective bidders pointed out that the posted TOR prepared by the LTO appeared tailored for just one particular bidder.
This prompted a review of the TOR by the DOTr “to promote competition and invite as many prospective bidders to get the most responsive and advantageous bid,” according to the DOTr timeline.
Another option, however, is to have the NPO produce the plastic license cards under a direct arrangement between the two government agencies, which will no longer require public bidding.
This is what Bautista has decided to do.
But transport groups are divided over the government-to-government procurement arrangement decided by the DOTr.?Interviewed by The STAR, Mar Valbuena, president of the group Manibela, maintained that the procurement of driver’s licenses “should undergo the bidding process and ensure transparency on the use of taxpayers’ money.”
On the other hand, Piston president Mody Floranda is pleased with the development. “We’ve been saying that the government should print the licenses and plates (and) can tap the National Printing Office.”?Floranda took a swipe at the LTO for issuing a paper instead of the plastic card to motorists renewing their driver’s license.
“Imagine when you are renewing and you only receive paper. It is better for the national government to manage the printing of the licenses and plates,” he said.

Philstar.com hosts its content but has no editorial control over it.","May 5, 202","MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Transportation (DOTr) is eyeing the government-controlled APO Production Unit Inc. as possible supplier of plastic driver’s license cards, the shortage of which has marred the issuance of driver’s licenses by the Land Transportation Office (LTO).
In a statement yesterday, the DOTr said Secretary Jaime Bautista “is also looking into discussions with the APO Production Unit” for the supply of cards.
On Wednesday, The STAR reported that Bautista was in discussions with National Printing Office (NPO) director Carlos Bathan for a supply arrangement.
This developed as the LTO has made it clear the extension of the validity of driver’s licenses until Oct. 31 stays.
“The extension in the validity of driver’s license until Oct. 31, 2023 will remain effective so that they apply for the renewal of their license without any penalty,” LTO Strategic Communications Office chief Divine Reyes said.
According to its website, APO Production Unit is under direct supervision of the Office of the President, through the Presidential Communications Office.
Bautista clarified that the discussions with Bathan were “exploratory,” to determine “possible scenarios in the event that their services will be engaged.” But he said Bathan is expected to submit a proposal within the week.
“The Central Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) will require further details before an agency-to-agency arrangement can be finalized through a Memorandum of Agreement, as required under existing laws, rules and regulations,” the DOTr said.
BAC has launched a competitive bidding for the supply of the cards, and set for May 24 this year the opening of the bids. Aside from having competitive bidding for the supply of plastic cards, the DOTr said it is open to partnering with other government agencies for the same endeavor.
With plastic cards in short supply, the LTO earlier said driver’s license may have to be printed on paper.
While talks with the NPO were still exploratory, according to the DOTr, Reyes said they have already inked an agreement for the production initially of five million cards.
“Just like our previous statement, the LTO will wait for the delivery of the supplies of plastic cards to be procured by the DOTr to ensure the continuous production of plastic driver’s license cards,” Reyes said.
LTO chief Jay Art Tugade has attributed the shortage of plastic cards and license plates to a DOTr order in January 2023, directing its attached agencies to forward to the central office all procurements of more than P50 million.
Tugade said that the LTO needs at least 30,000 plastic cards daily for the printing of driver’s licenses.
The LTO has also ordered a review of the examination procedures for driver’s license applicants as he acknowledged that the lengthy exam process is one of the reasons why many driver applicants resort to dealing with fixers.
“The instruction I gave to our committee was to compress the exam. This exam reportedly takes about an hour. The agency is now studying how to shorten the exam. I believe that by reducing the exam duration, our applicants will not seek out fixers and will opt to take the exam themselves,” Tugade said.
Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) said there would be no more confiscation of driver’s license for traffic violations in general under the single-ticketing system.
However, driver’s license of motorist would be confiscated if the offender has not paid fines for previous offense or has been apprehended for driving an unregistered vehicle.
Driver’s license would also be confiscated if the holder is involved in an accident, or is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, it added.
Driver’s license would also be confiscated from a habitual traffic violator that has collected 10 demerit points. For traffic violators with 40 demerit points, their license would be cancelled.
Under the single ticketing system, demerit points are given for failure to pay fines within 10 days from apprehension.
Motorists can contest – online or in person – their apprehension within 10 working days at either the MMDA, the LTO or the LGU that issued the violation ticket. — Ghio Ong

11,"Marcos, US senators discuss defense, climate change",Alexis Romero - The Philippine Star This content was originally published by The Philippine Star following its editorial guidelines. Philstar.com hosts its content but has no editorial control over it.,"May 5, 202","WASHINGTON – President Marcos met with some US senators yesterday to tackle various issues, including defense, agriculture and climate change mitigation and to express his intention to further strengthen the Philippines’ ties with its treaty ally, Malacañang said yesterday.
During the meeting, Marcos, a former lawmaker, said engagements between Manila and Washington should not just take place at the executive branch but also with members of Congress.
He praised the US for its willingness to work with the Philippines “as an equal, sovereign partner” and noted that defense and security engagement remains the “key pillar” of their bilateral relations.
“The President also expressed the Philippines’ intention to deepen cooperation with the US in the areas of supply chain, health and health security, environment, energy security, and interconnectivity,” the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) said in a statement.
According to the PCO, Marcos and the senators discussed a wide range of issues that include security, defense, agriculture and climate change mitigation, economic cooperation and cyber security. It did not elaborate on the points raised during the meeting, which was held after Marcos’ engagement with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin III at the Pentagon.
The President thanked Sen. Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, and other members of the panel for welcoming his delegation to Capitol Hill and for the “frank” and “productive” discussions on the state of bilateral relations between Manila and Washington.
Aside from Menendez, present during the meeting was Sen. James Risch, a ranking member of the Senate foreign relations committee. Also present were Speaker Martin Romualdez, Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo, Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez, Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla and Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual.
Earlier this week, Marcos had separate meetings with US President Joe Biden and US Vice President Kamala Harris to reaffirm the longstanding alliance between the Philippines and the US.
In his previous speeches, Marcos cited the need to strengthen and update partnerships and alliances to enable the Philippines to cope with new challenges.
In a related development, Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink said the US and the Philippines will co-host in Manila the 6th annual Indo-Pacific Business Forum next year with the US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).
Romualdez, meanwhile, stressed the role of the legislature in efforts of the Philippines and the US to strengthen relations.
“We, at the House, welcome the suggestion of President Marcos Jr. that efforts to boost the longstanding bond of friendship between the Philippines and the US should also involve the respective legislative branches of the two countries,” the House leader said.
“We are ready to take up that challenge and we look forward to more engagements with our counterparts in the US in the future,” Romualdez said.
“While the conduct of foreign relations is largely the domain of the executive, engagements between the lawmakers of both countries would be of immense value in, for instance, harmonizing the legal framework governing their bilateral relations,” he pointed out.
“We have actually taken the initiative to move toward the direction suggested by President Marcos,” the Speaker added.
In April, Romualdez, along with several members of the House, flew to the US and met with key congressional leaders to lay the groundwork for the official visit of President Marcos. – Delon Porcalla, Pia Lee-Brago

Philstar.com hosts its content but has no editorial control over it.,"May 5, 202","MANILA, Philippines — President Marcos has created an inter-agency committee that will plan and implement programs and projects for the commemoration of the 125th anniversary of Philippine independence on June 12.
Under Administrative Order 8, signed by Marcos on Tuesday, the body will be chaired by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) while the Department of the Interior and Local Government will serve as vice-chair.
The committee’s members include the Department of Tourism, Department of Education, Department of National Defense, Department of Information and Communications Technology, Department of Trade and Industry, Department of Budget and Management, Department of Labor and Employment, Department of Transportation, and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority.
The country will commemorate the 125th anniversary of Philippine independence from 2023 to 2026 to “give focus on the freedom that our forebears struggled for towards that they dreamed for the country and the history that we seek to remember and honor them with,” the order said.
It directed concerned agencies to “reinvigorate government support for historical research; and sustaining and enhancing programs for the protection, preservation and conservation of historical relics and memorabilia, monuments, sites and other historical resources.”
Republic Act 10086 or the “Strengthening Peoples’ Nationalism Through Philippine History Act” provides that the state shall provide the means to “strengthen people’s nationalism, love of country, respect for its heroes and pride for the people’s accomplishments by reinforcing the importance of Philippine national and local history in daily life with the end view of raising social consciousness.”
The 125th anniversary of Philippine independence and nationhood will have the theme “Kalayaan. Kinabukasan. Kasaysayan (Freedom. Future. History).”
On March 4, the NHCP launched a 100-day countdown at the Emilio Aguinaldo Shrine in Kawit, Cavite, where Philippine independence was declared on June 12, 1898.
Republic Act 4166, signed by the late president Diosdado Macapagal on Aug. 4, 1964, changed the date of Philippine Independence Day to June 12 from July 4. The law also declared July 4 as Philippine Republic Day also known as Philippine-American Friendship Day.
The NHCP is the national agency mandated to promote and preserve Philippine historical heritage through research and publication, conservation, heraldry and administration of historic sites and structures.

13,DTI continues crackdown on non-compliant vape shops,Catherine Talavera - The Philippine Star This content was originally published by The Philippine Star following its editorial guidelines. Philstar.com hosts its content but has no editorial control over it.,"May 5, 202","MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) yesterday closed two shops selling vaporized nicotine and non-nicotine products in Valenzuela City.
The DTI confiscated 205 pieces of vape products worth P63,340 from one vape shop for violating Republic Act 11900 or the vaporized nicotine and non-nicotine products regulation act.
The law prohibits the sale of vape products that are packaged, labeled, presented or marketed with flavor descriptors that are proven to unduly appeal particularly to minors.
The DTI Fair Trade Enforcement Bureau inspected vape shops in Valenzuela City.
The inspections were led by DTI - Consumer Protection Group Undersecretary Ruth Castelo along with Valenzuela Mayor Wes Gatchalian.
During the inspection, at least two vape shops were ordered closed due to lack of business permit, and in violation of the distance from a school, respectively.
Gatchalian explained that one of the shops was within 100 meters from the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Valenzuela.
Section 9 of RA 11900 states that the sale, promotion, advertising, and product demonstration of Vaporized Nicotine and Non-Nicotine Products or Novel Tobacco Products within 100 meters from a school, playground or other facility frequented by minors is prohibited.
RA 11900, which lapsed into law on July 25, 2022, covers vapor products/refills, vapor product devices, heated tobacco products, HTP consumables and devices as well as novel tobacco products.
Initial data from the DTI also showed that one of the inspected vape stores is compliant with the law.
Castelo expressed gratitude to Gatchalian for supporting the DTI’s crackdown on non-compliant vape stores.
Apart from physical vape stores, the DTI earlier urged e-commerce platforms to comply with the law regulating vape products.
“We appeal to online marketplaces to police their sellers and ensure that appropriate age verification mechanisms and point of sale signs are in place, and that all listed products bear the required graphic health warnings prescribed by law,” Castelo said. – Mark Ernest Villeza

14,DENR bats for ‘regenerative’ tourism to boost ecotourism,Bella Cariaso - The Philippine Star This content was originally published by The Philippine Star following its editorial guidelines. Philstar.com hosts its content but has no editorial control over it.,"May 5, 202","MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) pushed for a shift to “regenerative” tourism to boost the country’s ecotourism sector.
In her speech during the International Ecotourism Forum held recently in Manila, Environment Secretary Maria Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga, who was represented by DENR Undersecretary for legal and administration Ernesto Adobo Jr., defined regenerative tourism as “leaving a place better than it was before.”
“It (regenerative tourism) goes beyond the environment and looks at the social and economic development of communities, preservation of local cultures, and protection of biodiversity. It is the understanding that everything is connected and the interactions between every stakeholder throughout the tourism value chain have impacts on each other and our ecosystems,” Yulo-Loyzaga said.
Yulo-Loyzaga emphasized the importance of transitioning toward tourism that regenerates the environment.
She noted that the country’s tourism sector faces challenges brought by climate change, extreme weather events, and slow and rapid onset hazards, which impede its potential to be a driver of environmental and cultural protection, economic progress, and social development.
According to Yulo-Loyzaga, the DENR has been at the forefront of ecotourism development through sustainable management of protected areas under the National Integrated Protected Areas System or NIPAS program.
The program promotes sustainable tourism and responsible travel to natural areas through national and localized guidelines and standards, educational conservation, and economic and social development of local communities.
“Equity is central to ecotourism. Development assistance for communities to help them leverage the economic value of their natural assets should be strengthened. Ecotourism can be a powerful tool for conservation, community development, and education, but it requires careful planning and management to ensure that it benefits both the environment and the local communities,” Yulo-Loyzaga added.
