0,Duterte urged to retract ‘red-tagging spree’ as DepEd revises K to 12 curriculum,Merlina Hernando-Malipot,"May 5, 2023 ","As the Department of Education (DepEd) revises the K to 12 curriculum, a group urged Vice President Sara Duterte, who serves as the Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary in a concurrent capacity, to retract her “red-tagging statements” publicly apologize for “attacking human rights.”

“Teachers welcome inclusion of red-tagging as human rights violation is a welcome development,” said Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) Philippines Chairperson Vladimer Quetua in a statement issued on Friday, May 5.
Quetua is referring to the inclusion of red-tagging as a human rights violation in the proposed Curriculum Guide for Grade 10 under the subject Araling Panlipunan or Social Studies.
“We commit to fulfilling our mandate on human rights education that is relevant to our time,” Quetua said. “We hope our agency shows the same dedication,” he added.
ACT also issued the statement as a reaction to the Commission on Human Rights' statement that other government agencies should emulate the DepEd’s commitment to counter red-tagging and other human rights violations, as indicated by its proposed revised Grade 10 curriculum.
For the group, DepEd “cannot be a model of human rights advocacy until DepEd Secretary VP Sara Duterte retracts her red-tagging statements against ACT and other progressive groups, and publicly apologizes for attacking human rights.”
“DepEd's purported commitment against red-tagging does not hold water when the agency head does not even bat an eye while red-tagging our unions,” Quetua said.
If DepEd is “sincere in this advocacy,” Quetua said that Duterte should “set the good example of admitting her mistakes and issuing an apology.”
“It is important for VP Duterte to clarify that red-tagging endangers the lives of its subjects, as how her previous words have put our teachers and unions in an unsafe spot,” Quetua said.
“Only through this can DepEd prove its sincerity in upholding human rights,” he added.

1,Some senators open to nuclear energy as potential solution to PH power woes ​,Hannah Torregoza,"May 5, 2023 "," 
 
Some senators agree in principle that nuclear energy is a potential solution to the Philippine’s perrenial power problem but stressed there is a need to raise public awareness and ensure public safety.
 
Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go said the proposed construction and operation of a nuclear power plant in the country can significantly address electricity woes, benefit the economy and lead to more job opportunities. 
 
Go is also confident that with the increased availability of affordable and reliable electricity, the government would potentially attract investments from both domestic and international industries, leading to further economic growth. 
 
“That's the most important thing right now, to be able to provide jobs because the stomachs of our compatriots need to be filled. It’s a big thing that we are inviting foreign investors to invest (in nuclear energy) in our country,” Go said in a recent interview.
 
President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr. has successfully wrapped up his visit to the United States recently, and was able to secure potential investments, particularly from a US-based nuclear energy firm that has expressed interest in investing in the Philippines.
 
NuScale Power Corporation, a nuclear energy firm based in Oregon that is known for developing a safe modular, and scalable small nuclear power system, has disclosed it is now looking for a potential site in the country.
 
The Presidential Communications Office said NuScale is expected to invest US$6.5-billion to US$7.5 billion (P415.5 billion) to provide 462 megawatts to the country by the early 2030’s.
 
Go said the demand for electricity may surge and the implementation of a nuclear power plant may potentially provide a viable solution. 
 
But the senator said it is important to balance the progress with safety precautions and public understanding of nuclear energy to alleviate any concerns and misconceptions surrounding the use of nuclear power.
 
""Speaking of nuclear power, in principle, for me, if it helps with additional power here and prevent brownouts, that is okay. But our countrymen must understand what is nuclear power because when our countrymen hear  the word 'nuclear,’ the fear is there,” Go cited.
 
“What they immediately think of (when they hear the word) 'nuclear' (is a type of explosive). So this should be understood and safety should be prioritized. Is it safe to use this nuclear power? So let me repeat, the safety of our countrymen is what we should consider, let's put their safety first and they should understand what it really is,” he stressed.
 
Last April, Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian have also floated suggestions for the government to now consider nuclear power and other modern technologies to address electricity woes that are expected to perform long-term.
 
Gatchalian, vice chair of the Senate Committee on Energy, lamented that the Philippines remains fully dependent on foreign sources for coal. 
 
He also noted that the country is only 50 percent self-sufficient in terms of energy generation. 
 
“No matter how controversial, we should also look at new technologies for nuclear power, such as smaller modular reactors and Generation IV nuclear reactors,” Gatchalian had said.

2,Bilibid’s Covid-19 infection rises – BuCor,Jeffrey Damicog,"May 5, 2023 ","The number of Covid-infected persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) and personnel at the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) in Muntinlupa City has risen to 82, the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) said on Friday, May 5.
In a statement, BuCor’s Director for Health and Welfare Services Dr. Maria Cecilia Villanueva reported “there are 75 PDLs still on isolation with mild symptoms including 15 senior citizens.”
Seven personnel have tested positive for Covid-19 and have been advised to undergo self-isolation after they were given medical prescription, Villanueva said.
She also said that “13 PDLs have been discharged from the NBP’s isolation ward after the negative result on their second rapid antigen test conducted this on Friday morning, while two PDLs were transferred to a different ward due to other medical conditions.”
“There were no reported Covid-19 cases in other prison and penal farms nationwide,” she added.
Visitation privileges of PDLs at the NBP and the Corrections Institution for Women (CIW) in Mandaluyong City have been suspended by BuCor  Director General Gregorio Pio P. Catapang Jr.
Catapang had also required all visitors and individuals transacting in all BuCor offices at the national headquarters to wear facemask and present latest rapid antigen test.

3,"Oil spill clean-up: 85.41% of affected shoreline in Pola, Or. Mindoro now cleared",Martin Sadongdong,"May 5, 2023 ","Authorities are optimistic that the on-going clean-up operations in areas affected by the massive oil spill in Oriental Mindoro will yield more positive results as 85.41 percent of shoreline in Pola town was already cleared, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said Friday, May 5.

Based on its “Shoreline Clean-up Accomplishment Report” dated May 4, the PCG said that its Incident Management Team (IMT) in Oriental Mindoro has already covered 29.13 km (85.41 percent) of total length cleaned from 11 oil spill-impacted barangays in Pola, which is one of the heavily affected towns by the spill.
The clean-up percentage reflected an “acceptably clean” shoreline in Pola compared to the previous impact of the spill, the PCG said.
Meanwhile, four villages – Brgy. Misong, Brgy. Tiguihan, Zone 1, and Zone 2 – remain to be 100 percent “acceptably clean” in Pola.
In Naujan town, where motor tanker (MT) Princess Empress sank, the PCG said that some 5.3 km of affected shoreline were already cleared. This translates to a 74.82 percent clean-up rate in Naujan. 
Commodore Geronimo Tuvilla, commander of IMT-Oriental Mindoro, extended appreciation to the joint workforce operating in Oriental Mindoro’s clean-up for their “diligent efforts” in mitigating the impact of the incident to the maritime environment.
Among the workers involved in the clean-up are PCG marine science technicians, and counterparts from the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Harbor Start Shipping Services Inc., and other volunteers.
“Rest assured that the PCG’s marine environmental frontliners will remain steadfast in its shoreline clean-up, re-survey, and continuous monitoring for possible new sightings of oil while awaiting and after the actual siphoning operations,” Tuvilla said.
MT Princess Empress sank off Naujan town on Feb. 28 while carrying 800,000 liters of industrial fuel oil. The cargo oil leaked which resulted to a massive spillage in Oriental Mindoro, Antique, Palawan, and Batangas.
As of May 4, the PCG said that it has collected 6,070 sacks or approximately 151,750 kilos of oil-contaminated debris in Oriental Mindoro.

4,Olongapo mayor tells House panel why LGU won't pay P7.33-B debt to PSALM,Ellson Quismorio,"May 5, 2023 ","Olongapo City Mayor Rolen Paulino Jr. has told congressmen that the city government cannot, and will not, pay its rather enormous P7.33-billion debt to the National Power Corporation (Napocor) and Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM).
Paulino justified the city government’s decision during a recent technical working group (TWG) meeting of the Committee on Energy in the House of Representatives.
Tackled during the meeting was House Bill (HB) No.7001, which seeks the condonation of all unpaid debts, including interest payments, value-added taxes (VAT), and other charges on power bills that the Public Utilities Department (PUD) - Olongapo City owes Napocor and PSALM.
""Hindi na po namin talaga mababayaran po yan at wala po kaming planong bayaran (We really cannot pay that and we don't have plans to pay it),"" Paulino told the House panel chaired by Marinduque lone district Rep. and former House Speaker Lord Allan Velasco.
""Kasi kada piso po na ibibigay namin sa PSALM para dito sa utang na wala naman po dapat, piso po 'yong nalalayo sa mga eskwelahan natin, na nalalayo sa ospital natin, na nalalayo po sa mga infrastructure na kailangang kailangan natin (It's because for every peso that we pay to PSALM for this debt that we shouldn't even have, we lose this peso from our schools, our hospitals, and from our much-needed infrastructure),"" he said.
Paulino also said that the local government unit's (LGU) current budget is P2 billion, or nearly a quarter of the debt. This makes the settlement of the debt impossible.
Zambales 1st district Rep. Jefferson Khonghun agreed with the mayor's stance, saying that it was unacceptable to settle an obligation that supposedly resulted from the mismanagement of the previous Olongapo City local government.
Khonghun, a vice chairman of the energy panel, authored HB No.7001.
NPC and PSALM expressed support for the measure. However, Department of Finance (DOF) Privatization and Corporate Affairs Group (PCAG) Director Joanna Castillo said the department cannot allow the proposed condonation, as it would set a bad precedent for other companies.
The TWG meeting was suspended to allow DOF to prepare and submit a position paper on the matter.

6,"Expedite release of Excellence in Teacher Education Act IRR, agencies told",Merlina Hernando-Malipot,"May 5, 2023 ","To further strengthen teacher education in the country, an advocacy group urged education agencies to fast-track the publication of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of the Republic Act (RA) 11713 or the Excellence in Teacher Education Act.

“The publication of the IRR will help realize the benefits of the law, especially in ensuring that teacher education institutions meet the necessary standards of quality education delivery which is crucial in addressing the current learning crisis in the Philippines,” Philippine Business for Education (PBEd) Executive Director Justine Raagas said in a statement.
PBEd noted that the IRR “has yet to be issued a year after” the Excellence in Teacher Education Act was enacted into law.
The IRR, the group stressed, is crucial to start the review of the questions in the Board Licensure Exam for Professional Teachers and its alignment with the Commission on Higher Education’s (CHED) teacher education curriculum and with what Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) are teaching. It is also needed for budget allocation for the Teacher Education Scholarship Program (TESP) for aspiring teachers.
“We value the government’s efforts in addressing the learning crisis and improving teacher education in the country through the enactment of laws, but for purposes of clear implementation, it is imperative that we have a set or written implementing rules to guide us,” Raagas said.
RA 11713 was signed into law last April 27, 2022.
The law seeks to improve the quality of teacher education and development in the country by expanding and strengthening the function of the Teacher Education Council, establishing scholarship programs, and institutionalizing the National Educators' Academy of the Philippines.
Previously, PBEd participated in the IRR’s stakeholders drafting and consultation and provided policy recommendations that will further push for collaboration between the Professional Regulation Commission, CHED, and TEIs, and further operationalize the TESP.

7,PH to pursue talks with China on Malampaya gas fields—Marcos,Betheena Unite,"May 5, 2023 ","WASHINGTON, D.C.— The Philippines will continue to negotiate with China over its claims on the Malampaya natural gas fields.
President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. bared this as he concluded his five-day visit in Washington on Friday morning (Manila time), and said that both parties are “slowly inching towards a resolution” regarding their claims.
He stressed that the only way to resolve this is to keep the communication lines open.
“The only way to resolve the issues that are outstanding is to once again keep talking and to come to a consensus, to come to an agreement and to continue to negotiate,"" Marcos said during a forum at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
""It is not an easy process but the Malampaya fields, natural gas fields that lie in our, within our baselines and within our exclusive economic zone and that again is being questioned in certain cases, in certain areas by China and we continue to negotiate with them,” Marcos added.
The President further said ""we continue to find a way,' and that the essential roadblock to that whole process has been very simple,” the chief executive added.
He said the Chinese government has been claiming particular areas where the Malampaya fields are located but these areas are already recognized as part of the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines as determined by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in its July 2016 ruling.
“The nine dash line covers just about the entire West Philippine Sea. We, on the other hand, have established our baselines which have been recognized and accredited by UNCLOS and therefore there is that conflict and so what happens now especially when it comes to exploration in --- for energy --- for our energy needs are which law will apply because we say this is part of Philippine territory and therefore Philippine law should apply,” Marcos said.
“It may have to come down to a compromise that will just limit that application, the application of laws maybe to the vessels that are involved in this exploration and exploitation of whatever natural gas fields we can access,” he added.
The chief executive said the resolution to this issue cannot be done overnight but noted that it is just one of the suggestions both parties are looking into to resolve the issue.
“There is no silver bullet where you say, we’ll do this and it’s done. As I said, we are inching slowly towards the resolution and that’s why we must be constant, we must be transparent and we must be accountable for all that we do.  And I cannot see any other way to handle the problem other than that,” the President added.
The Malampaya gas field is a deepwater gas-condensate reservoir, located offshore, 65 kilometers northwest of the island of Palawan.

11,Gov't to pursue illegal drug trade syndicates --- PBBM,Betheena Unite,"May 5, 2023 ","WASHINGTON, D.C.— Going after syndicates involved in the illegal drug trade is the current administration's priority action to curb the illegal drug problem in the Philippines.
Steering away from his predecessor's playbook, Marcos said on an international platform that the current government will investigate those who need to be probed and punished.
This as he believes that the ""main players"" in the illegal drug trade are not those on the streets doing small-time drug trade but the syndicates who keep gaining power and influence, he said.
""Kailangan natin maging maingat din na hindi tayo — hindi natin hahabulin yung mga walang kinalaman (We need to be careful not to go after those who are innocents),"" Marcos said during his post-visit briefing.
""Kaya’t kailangan natin pag-aralan kung sino ba talaga ang dapat imbestigahan, kung sino ba talaga ang dapat parusahan (So we must only investigate those who need to be punished),"" Marcos added.
During his engagement at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) forum, he said ""syndicates have grown stronger and wealthier and more influential.""
""But instead of going after everyone, we have try to identify the key areas where we have --- that we have to tackle, the key areas that we have to attend to so that we can see a diminution of the activity of the drug syndicates,"" Marcos said.
The President also pointed out that the problem in addressing illegal drug trade in the country also lies in enforcement.
""We are looking at the problem as a whole. We start with the errant policemen. We go back to the rehabilitation process for those who have unfortunately fallen into this addiction cycle and for the young people in the country who have yet to --- I hope and we hope will never enter into that kind of lifestyle to continue to educate and to give options to our young people so that they are not --- they do not --- they are not tempted to indulge in these activities,"" Marcos said.
The chief executive said he has formed a commission and asked for the resignation of all the police officers suspected of involvement in the illegal drug trade.
Marcos revealed they have received about 917 resignations from police officers from colonel level.

13,"Rep Teves, 2 sons ask DOJ to dismiss 'illegal possession' of firearms, explosives charges",Jeffrey Damicog,"May 5, 2023 ","Suspended Negros Oriental 3rd District Rep. Arnolfo “Arnie” A. Teves Jr. and his two sons – Kurt Matthew and Axel – on Friday, May 5, asked the Department of Justice (DOJ) to dismiss the criminal charges filed against them for alleged violations of the laws on illegal possession of firearms and explosives.
With the filing of the motions to dismiss during the hearing, the DOJ’s panel of prosecutors decided to submit for resolution the criminal charges filed by the Philippine National Police-Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (PNP-CIDG).
Teves and his sons were accused of violating Republic Act (RA) 10591 and RA 9516 for alleged illegal possession of firearms and explosives, respectively.  The alleged firearms and explosives were seized by the PNP-CIDG during the service of a search warrant in the legislator’s house in Bayawan City last March 10.
Ferdinand Topacio, lawyer of the Teves family, asked the DOJ panel to be impartial despite the accusation of Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin C. Remulla that the suspended legislator is “one of the masterminds” in the March 4 killings in Pamplona town where one of the victims was Negros Oriengal Gov. Roel R. Degamo.
Teves, who is still abroad, has denied all the allegations against him.
Topacio said the panel has two months to resolve the charges.
“Time bound po ang panel under the 2017 rules ng national prosecution office. Sixty days po ay kailangan maglabas na sila (The panel is time-bound under the 2017 DOJ Revised Manual for Prosecutors. Within 60 days it has to release the resolution of the case),” he said.
In the motion filed by Topacio for Teves, the DOH was told that the “complainants miserably failed to discharge their duty to establish probable cause against Respondent Teves Jr. as nothing has been shown to support his alleged constructive possession of any of the confiscated articles, much less of the premises where they were allegedly found.”
“There is no question on the fact that Respondent Teves Jr. was not present when and where the alleged search and seizure transpired. This is settled from the complaints and supporting affidavits and other documents attached thereto. Physical or actual possession of any of the subject firearms, ammunition and explosives on his part is, therefore, necessarily absent,” the motion stated.
Topacio said the firearms and explosives were illegal seized and should be inadmissible as evidence.
He alleged that the PNP violated the rules in implementing search warrants based on the joint affidavit of Barangay Captain Andrew I. Barte and Kagawad Ulysses Ilagan, who both served as police witnesses, as well as the affidavits issued by the staff of Teves who were present during the implementation of the search warrant and even took videos of pictures.
He said that witnesses disclosed that prior the presentation of the search warrant, members of the PNP’s Special Action Force (PNP-SAF) were already there at the house and were seen carrying large bags.
“These SAF team members, who are necessarily part of the team implementing the search warrant, broke and violated the most basic of statutes and rules that proscribe unreasonable searches and seizure,” he also said.
He pointed out that the rule violated is Section 8, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court which states: “No search of a house, room, or any premises shall be made except in the presence of the lawful occupant thereof or any member of his family or in the absence of the latter, two witnesses of sufficient age and discretion residing in the same locality.”
At the same time, Topacio said the PNP-SAF violated the 2021 Supreme Court rules which require law enforcers to use of body-worn cameras during the implementation search warrants.
He also alleged that “the barangay officials, or any other witnesses for that matter, were not present when the PNP-SAF team entered the house of Respondent Teves, Jr. with their bags” and that there was “some one-hour window within which the ‘clearing team’ consisting solely of SAF operatives, entered the residence and stayed there for some time without their action and activity being witnessed nor documented.”
“From the foregoing statements of witnesses, the so called SAF ‘clearing team,’ consisting of around thirty (30) PNP-SAF authorities, employed in the implementation of the search warrant , as if exempted from the rules on the implementation of the search warrants, entered the said premises: 1) without the owner of the house; 2) without any witnesses; 3) without allowing any photographing or video recording of their activities; 4) without having subjected themselves to frisking; and, 5) without have their bags checked by anyone. Then, they took their time therein for around an hour, from around 4:00 a.m. to around 5:00 a.m.,” he said.

14,Poe: Visayas power woes causing economic losses,Mario Casayuran,"May 5, 2023 ","Recurring power outrages are causing economic losses to businesses and tourism in Panay and Negros Islands, including Iloilo province, Senator Grace Poe on Friday, May 5, said.
""Talagang nakakagalit at nakakalungkot itong nangyayari (This situation causes anger and sadness),’’ Poe, chairperson of the Senate committee on public services, said.
""Sa panahong ito, pa'no mabubuhay ang turismo at negosyo sa Iloilo at Panay Island kung patay-sindi ang kuryente? During these times, how could tourism and business thrive when power is off and on)?"" she asked.
The lady lawmaker lamented she has been receiving complaints from various groups and residents of the provinces about the drawn-out brownouts which have caused distress and disturbance to businesses and homes.
For the past six months, these Visayan provinces have been enduring unannounced power interruption or blackout that would last for a whole day.
""Napakainit ngayon para mawalan ng kuryente at saka ang Iloilo pa naman napakaganda ng improvements (And these power outages happen during the current hot summer …Iloilo is beautiful because of improvements)  Marami nang pumupunta dyan na mga turista (Many tourists are going there), ” Poe said.
This poor service, according to Poe, affects learners who have to be in school buildings that are like furnaces. It also affects farmers, she added.
Poe said she also received reports about an elderly who had asthma attack due to heat, but could not avail of PhilHealth benefits because her records were not updated.
She stressed that this and similar issues should be fixed to allow members to avail of the services of the government.
Poe recently filed Senate Resolution 579 calling for an inquiry into the Panay Island power outages and seeking solution to finally end the residents' woes.
She said there is a need to find out the cause of the grid disturbances reported by the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) allegedly due to the tripping of distribution utilities (DUs).
The DUs, meanwhile, have pointed to the NGCP as the origin of the problem.
Poe pointed out that there are many issues bugging the management and operation of NGCP that need to be addressed.
