0,RUTHLESS APPROACH | Marcos says Duterte’s drug war had abuses,By Beatrice Puente,"May 5, 2023 ,","By Beatrice Puente
(May 5, 2023) – President Bongbong Marcos Jr. on Thursday admitted there were abuses in the brutal war on drugs of his predecessor, former President Rodrigo Duterte, because of the heavy focus on enforcement.
In a forum by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, Marcos also acknowledged that the heavy-handed approach was one of the factors that contributed to the criticisms of the country’s human rights situation.
“What had happened in the last administration is that we focused on enforcement. And because of that, it could be said that there were abuses by certain elements in the government that have caused some concern in many quarters about the human rights situation in the Philippines,” said Marcos.
Marcos, a political ally of the Duterte family, said he could not speak about what the former tough-talking leader “had in mind” but noted that the drug problem is a source of the criminality in the country.
“Syndicates have become stronger, wealthier, and more influential, worryingly so. Instead of going after everyone, I tried to identify the key areas we have to tackle and attend to so that we can see a diminution of the activity of drug syndicates,” claimed Marcos.
He added that his administration seeks to double down on prevention and rehabilitation to prevent more individuals from becoming dependent on narcotics. Even before winning the presidency, Marcos vowed to tweak the government’s anti-drug campaign into a more holistic approach.
“We should look at the rehabilitation of those who have already fallen into the drug culture, which has destroyed their lives. Further back, (there must be) the process of reeducation and explaining, especially to young people, the potential damage (of drugs) to their lives,” said Marcos.
Duterte faces heavy scrutiny as the International Criminal Court investigates his bloody war on drugs. The Philippine National Police (PNP) said the killings are over 6,000 but human rights groups said a more accurate figure would be around 30,000 if vigilante deaths were included.
While Marcos touted a new approach, research groups noted that drug-related killings have continued. Dahas, a project of the Third World Studies Center of the University of the Philippines, tallied 95 deaths from January to April. Of this figure, around 44% to 46% were committed by state agents.
“NCR (National Capital Region) remains the top hotspot. Davao City is the close second where the police are doing all the drug-related killings,” wrote Dahas in an update last Wednesday.
Noting that some law enforcers continue to be involved in illegal acts, Marcos touted their move of asking for the courtesy resignations of high-ranking officers of the PNP as part of a cleansing process.
The authorities have yet to announce the two colonels and the two generals likely to be removed after the five-person panel made their assessment.

1,MARITIME DISPUTE | U.S. issues guidelines on defending Philippines from South China Sea attack,By Karen Lema,"May 4, 2023 ,","By Karen Lema
MANILA, May 4 (Reuters) – The United States has laid out in clear terms the extent of its defence treaty commitments to the Philippines, issuing new guidelines that refer specifically to attacks in the South China Sea, including on its coast guard.
The six-page “bilateral defence guidelines” agreed in Washington on Wednesday follow a renewed push under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr to update the Mutual Defense Treaty with the former colonial ruler, at a time of increased tension and maritime confrontation with China.
The guidelines were a first since the treaty was signed in 1951 and follow scores of Philippine diplomatic protests in the past year over what it calls China’s “aggressive” actions and threats against its coast guard.
The guidelines said the bilateral treaty commitments would be invoked if either is attacked specifically in the South China Sea and also if coast guard vessels were the target.
It was also updated to include references to modern forms of warfare, including “grey zone tactics”, which China is accused of using to assert its claims to sovereignty. The guidelines did not mention China specifically.
“Recognising that threats may arise in several domains – including land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace – and take the form of asymmetric, hybrid, and irregular warfare and grey-zone tactics, the guidelines chart a way forward to build interoperability in both conventional and non-conventional domains,” according to the Pentagon.
‘WARNING’ TO CHINA
The South China Sea, a waterway vital to global trade, has become a major flashpoint in the increasingly testy relationship between China and the United States.
The guidelines send a “warning” to China against targeting the Philippine coast guard said Rommel Ong, former vice commander of the Philippine navy and a professor at the Ateneo School of Government.
Julio Amador, head of the Foundation for the National Interest, a Manila-based think-tank focusing on strategic and security issues, said of the security guidelines “It’s clear that it will give China some pause.”
China’s foreign ministry on Thursday said it opposed the use of bilateral defence treaties to interfere in the South China Sea, which “should not be a hunting ground for external forces”.
The guidelines were released during visit to Washington this week by Marcos, which included talks with counterpart Joe Biden.
Marcos also met Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who told him “we will always have your back, in the South China Sea or elsewhere in the region.”
Ties with the United States have deepened under Marcos, who in February granted its military access to more of his country’s bases, prompting accusations from China that the deal was “stoking the fire” of regional tension.

2,"‘BROADER UNDERSTANDING’ | Same-sex union part of curriculum since 2013, says DepEd",By Beatrice Puente,"May 4, 2023 ,","By Beatrice Puente
(May 4, 2023) – The Department of Education (DepEd) on Wednesday said the topic of same-sex union has been part of the curriculum since 2013 after a religious lawmaker criticized the agency for including such issue in the revisions of the educational program.
In a statement, the DepEd said it is open to the comments aired by all sides before finalizing the changes in the K-10 curriculum guide for students.
“It seeks to provide learners with a broader understanding of gender-based issues, encourage respect within the community, and promote inclusivity,” said the DepEd, which is headed by Vice President Sara Duterte-Carpio. “Nonetheless, the department will consolidate and consider all comments received.”

Media reports said gender-related topics are included in the proposed draft for the Araling Panlipunan curriculum for Grade 10. It also aims to tackle gender roles, hate crime, discrimination, gender pay gap, local gender policies, and the differences between same-sex marriage and union.
But Cibac Rep. Eddie Villanueva, who heads the sustainable development goals panel in the House of Representatives, slammed the inclusion of same-sex union in the draft curriculum by claiming that it is “anti-God” and “unconstitutional.”
“We are shocked to discover that the promotion of gender ideology, same-sex union, and same-sex marriage is slowly creeping under our nose into the very curriculum of our basic education,” said Villanueva, founder of the Jesus is Lord Church. “What is more worrying is the slant towards promoting and condoning such practices in the minds of our young students.”
He expressed hope that the proposed curriculum will still go through revisions but he urged all stakeholders to monitor the situation.
“It is just very disturbing that there are proponents of gender ideology inside DepEd that injects this advocacy to the education of our youth. I am calling all stakeholders to be more vigilant on this issue because this is a primordial concern that will shape the moral fiber of our youth,” added Villanueva.
Over the past years, several lawmakers have filed legislations that seek to promote and protect the rights of the LGBTQ+ community, stressing that approving such measures do not diminish the rights of others. However, these proposals have faced long and tedious discussions at the legislature.
Meanwhile, the move to update the K-12 curriculum came as part of efforts to make basic education more responsive to the times in the face of an educational crisis worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Last January, the DepEd said it would like to revise the presently congested curriculum, noting that some “learning competencies are missing or misplaced.”
“We will make the curriculum relevant to produce competent, job-ready, active, and responsible citizens,” said Duterte-Carpio. “We will revise the K-12 curriculum to make them more responsive to our aspiration as a nation, to develop lifelong learners who are imbued with 21st-century skills, discipline, and patriotism.”

3,SERIOUS ALLEGATION | Russia says Ukraine tried to kill Putin with night-time drone attack,(Additional reporting by Felix Light and Jake Cordell; Writing by Mark Trevelyan and Kevin Liffey; editing by Nick Macfie),"May 4, 2023 ,","By Mark Trevelyan
May 3 (Reuters) – Russia accused Ukraine on Wednesday of attacking the Kremlin with drones overnight in an attempt to kill President Vladimir Putin – the most serious allegation that Moscow has levelled at Kyiv in more than 14 months of war.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy promptly denied any Ukrainian involvement, telling a press conference in Helsinki: “We don’t attack Putin, or Moscow, we fight on our territory.”
A senior Ukrainian presidential official said the incident instead suggested Moscow was preparing a major “terrorist provocation”.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had not been able to validate the reported attack, and that Russian assertions should be taken with a “very large shaker of salt”.
Russia reserved the right to retaliate, Putin’s office said, and Russian hardliners demanded swift retribution against Zelenskiy himself.
“Two uncrewed aerial vehicles were aimed at the Kremlin. As a result of timely actions taken by the military and special services with the use of radar warfare systems, the devices were put out of action,” the presidency said in a statement.
“We regard these actions as a planned terrorist act and an attempt on the president’s life, carried out on the eve of Victory Day, the May 9 Parade, at which the presence of foreign guests is also planned … “The Russian side reserves the right to take retaliatory measures where and when it sees fit.”
VIDEOS SHOW EXPLOSION OVER KREMLIN
Baza, a Telegram channel with links to Russia’s law enforcement agencies, posted a video showing a flying object approaching the dome of the Kremlin Senate building overlooking Red Square – site of next Tuesday’s Victory Day parade – and exploding in an intense burst of light just before reaching it.
Two similar videos posted on social media showed two objects flying on the same trajectory towards the dome, with the clock on the Kremlin’s Spassky Tower reading 2:27 and 2:43. The first seemed to be destroyed with little more than a puff of smoke, the second appeared to leave blazing wreckage on the dome.
Reuters checks on the time and location indicated that the videos could be authentic, although it was not clear how Ukraine, if it were involved, could seriously have expected to kill Putin with a drone strike on the Kremlin – a huge, historic walled citadel in the heart of Moscow.
Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in comments sent to Reuters: “In my opinion, it is absolutely obvious that both ‘reports about an attack on the Kremlin’ and simultaneously the supposed detention of Ukrainian saboteurs in Crimea … clearly indicate the preparation of a large-scale terrorist provocation by Russia in the coming days.”
The powerful speaker of the lower house of Russia’s parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, demanded the use of “weapons capable of stopping and destroying the Kyiv terrorist regime”.
And former president Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, said the incident “leaves us no option but to physically eliminate Zelenskiy and his clique”.
PUTIN ‘RARELY GOES TO KREMLIN’
But a British expert on Russia, Mark Galeotti, said it was unlikely that the alleged attack had targeted Putin, who “notoriously rarely goes to the Kremlin, let alone stays there overnight”.
“If we presume it was a Ukrainian attack,” Galeotti tweeted, “consider it a performative strike, a demonstration of capability and a declaration of intent: ‘don’t think Moscow is safe.'”
The presidential administration said fragments of the drones had been scattered on the territory of the Kremlin complex but there were no casualties or material damage.
The RIA news agency said Putin had not been in the Kremlin at the time, and was working on Wednesday at his Novo Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow.
Victory Day is a major public holiday commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two, and a chance for Putin to rally Russians behind what he calls his “special military operation” in Ukraine.
Russia marks the occasion with a huge military parade on Red Square, for which seating has already been erected.
The state news agency TASS said the parade – for which the Kremlin last week announced tighter security – would still go ahead.
Before the drone attack was announced, some 10 hours after the event, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said the city had introduced an immediate ban on unauthorised drone flights.
Russia has accused Ukraine of numerous cross-border attacks since the start of the war, including strikes in December on an air base deep inside Russian territory that houses strategic bomber planes equipped to carry nuclear weapons. In February, a drone crashed in Kolomna, about 110 km (70 miles) from the centre of Moscow.
Ukraine typically declines to claim responsibility for attacks on Russia or Russian-annexed Crimea, though Kyiv officials have frequently celebrated such attacks with cryptic or mocking remarks.

4,WEST PHILIPPINE SEA | US stands with Philippines against Chinese ‘intimidation’ in S. China Sea – official,By Karen Lema,"May 3, 2023 ,","By Karen Lema
May 3 (Reuters) – The United States stands with treaty ally the Philippines in the face of harassment by China’s coast guard in the South China Sea and remains deeply concerned about “intimidation” by Beijing, a senior U.S. official said on Tuesday.
A visit to the United States this week by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr highlights the strength and endurance of the alliance between the two countries, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel J. Kritenbrink said.
The Philippines on Friday accused China’s coast guard of “dangerous manoeuvres” and “aggressive tactics” in the South China Sea, in another maritime confrontation between the two countries. China said the Philippines vessels made “deliberate provocative moves”.
“We remain deeply concerned by (China’s) continued intimidation and harassment of Philippine vessels as they continue to undertake really routine patrols within the Philippine exclusive economic zone,” he said in a teleconference from the United States.
“Such actions and behaviour on the part of Beijing are truly unacceptable.”
Kritenbrink also said the United States and its partners recognised the importance of maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait.
The Philippines and United States on Monday reaffirmed their decades-old security alliance in a trip that marks a dramatic turnaround in their relations, as both countries seek ways to push back China’s assertiveness near Taiwan and in the South China Sea.
U.S. President Joe Biden told Marcos on Monday said the U.S. commitment to defending its treaty ally was “ironclad”. Marcos said the region had “arguably the most complicated geopolitical situation in the world right now.”
Under Rodrigo Duterte, Marcos’ anti-U.S. predecessor, relations soured as he sought to court China while openly rebuking Washington.
Kritenbrink said he was “exceptionally confident” about bilateral ties.

5,"‘TRUE FRIENDSHIP’ | Marcos cites need to ‘continually revisit’ trade ties between Philippines, US",By Beatrice Puente,"May 3, 2023 ,","By Beatrice Puente
(May 3, 2023) – President Bongbong Marcos Jr. stressed the need to constantly revisit the partnership between the Philippines and the United States (US) on the aspect of trade issues to ensure that they mutually benefit from it.
Marcos, who’s in the US for a four-day state visit, said it was difficult to categorize the relationship of the two longtime allies because it covers defense, trade, education, culture, and many other aspects.
“But it (the relations between the Philippines and the US) still needs to be continually revisited so as we can make the most of our friendship and our partnership,” said Marcos in a speech at the dinner hosted by the Philippine Embassy at the Blair House.
Marcos admitted that the Philippines and the US went through “turbulent times” but he noted that their close friendship helped them overcome the difficulties.
“We have prevailed through all that like a true friendship. And the reason for that, I believe, is that we truly have come to an understanding as to how we believe certain values and what is important and our role in the world, and that has never really been diminished,” added Marcos.
His predecessor, former President Rodrigo Duterte, was known for frequently berating the US while pivoting his foreign policy to China. Duterte repeatedly threatened to cancel the Visiting Forces Agreement, even ordering the US to pay if it wants to keep the deal. But Marcos has taken a different approach by balancing the country’s ties with the US and China as part of his “friend to all” approach.
In an earlier update, Biden said the US will send a presidential trade and investment mission to the Philippines, although the details are still unclear. He also promised to continue supporting the country on various issues, including economic cooperation, to further boost the decades-old alliance.
“Our countries not only share strong partnership. We share deep friendship, one that has been enriched by millions of Filipino-Americans and the communities all across the United States,” said Biden.
Marcos stressed that this kind of relationship is important in the face of various international concerns.
“Since things are so volatile, the stability would come from those alliances, those partnerships. And it is a strange thing to come from that situation where you have very polarized the world view, where now we have to look into very different directions all the time,” said Marcos.
In his meeting with US Vice President Kamala Harris, Marcos maintained that the security cooperation between the Philippines and the US will continue amid the challenges in the Asia-Pacific. Among the major issues confronting the Philippines is the hard-headed aggression of China in the West Philippine Sea.
“Cooperation with the United States certainly is just something that we are building upon that has been going on for many, many, many decades. And we just keep going,” said Marcos.

6,"US-PHILIPPINE TIES | Amid China pressure, US and Philippines recommit to security alliance","By Jeff Mason, Trevor Hunnicutt and David Brunnstrom","May 2, 2023 ,","By Jeff Mason, Trevor Hunnicutt and David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) – President Joe Biden told his counterpart Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday that the U.S. commitment to the defense of its ally was “ironclad,” including in the South China Sea where Manila is under pressure from China.
Marcos, on the first White House visit by a Philippines leader in 10 years, stressed the importance of the United States as his country’s sole treaty ally in a region with “arguably the most complicated geopolitical situation in the world right now.”
The two countries reaffirmed their decades-old security alliance in a trip that marks a dramatic turnaround in U.S.-Philippine relations as both countries seek ways to push back against what they see as China’s increasingly aggressive actions near Taiwan and in the South China Sea.
U.S. officials said the leaders would agree new guidelines for stronger military cooperation, as well as stepped up economic cooperation.
“The United States remains ironclad in our commitment to the defense of the Philippines, including the South China Sea,” Biden told Marcos in the Oval Office.
A joint statement said this meant that any armed attack on Philippine armed forces, public vessels or aircraft in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea, would invoke U.S. mutual defense commitments under a 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty.
Washington sees the Philippines as key to any effort to counter an invasion of Taiwan by China, which claims the self-ruled island as its own territory. Manila recently agreed to allow the United States access to four more of its military bases under an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, but the two sides have not said what U.S. assets will be stationed at those.
The joint statement said the leaders “affirm the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of global security and prosperity.”
Under Rodrigo Duterte, Marcos’ predecessor, U.S. relations soured as he turned the Philippines sharply away from its former colonial ruler and built closer ties with China.
Biden has invested in courting Marcos, who still faces a U.S. court judgment connected with $2 billion of plundered wealth under his father’s rule.
U.S. officials said the new guidelines focused on military coordination across land, sea, air, space and cyberspace, while the U.S. administration would also transfer three C-130 aircraft and look to send additional patrol vessels to the Philippines.
“It is only natural for the Philippines to look to its sole treaty partner in the world to strengthen and to redefine the relationship that we have and the roles that we play in the face of those rising tensions that we see now around the South China, Asia Pacific and Indo-Pacific region,” Marcos said.
The summit is the centerpiece of a four-day U.S. visit by Marcos that started on Sunday.
Marcos has sought warm relations with both the United States and China, who are vying for influence in the Indo-Pacific. The Biden-Marcos joint statement did not name the Chinese government.
Experts say Washington considers the Philippines a potential location for rockets, missiles and artillery systems to counter a Chinese amphibious assault on Taiwan.
However, Marcos told reporters on his plane China had agreed to discuss fishing rights in the South China Sea and also that he would not allow the Philippines to become a “staging post” for military action.
TRADE MISSION
The joint statement said Biden would send a Presidential Trade and Investment Mission to the Philippines to enhance investment in clean energy transition, the critical minerals sector, and food security.
The two countries would also co-host in Manila the 2024 Indo-Pacific Business Forum – the marquee U.S. commercial event in the region – which would further establish the Philippines as a key hub for regional supply chains.
The statement also said the countries looked forward to establishing trilateral cooperation with Japan and Australia.
With many Filipinos frustrated by China’s actions in the South China Sea, including the harassing of Philippine ships and fishermen in parts that both countries claim, popular support has grown in the Philippines for a tougher stance toward Beijing.
Biden was the first official to reach out to Marcos after his election and has made strengthening economic and military ties in the Indo-Pacific region a cornerstone of his foreign policy.
Before the summit, U.S. lawmakers sent a bipartisan letter to Biden calling on him to raise what they called the worsening human rights “crisis” in the Philippines.
They said there were well-documented violations under Duterte but recent reports showed “ongoing impunity.” They cited reports from the Karapatan Human Rights Alliance of 17 extrajudicial killings, 165 illegal arrests from July to December 2022, and a total of 825 political prisoners. A White House summary said human rights were among the topics being discussed by the two countries.

7,"DIRECT LINE | Philippines, China to discuss fishing rights in South China Sea, says Marcos",(Reporting by Enrico Dela Cruz; Editing by Alex Richardson),"May 2, 2023 ,","MANILA, May 1 (Reuters) – Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said China has agreed to discuss fishing rights in the South China Sea, as he pushed for a “direct communication line” with Beijing on maritime differences.
China has agreed to “sit down” and talk about Filipinos’ fishing rights in the South China Sea, Marcos said, adding he has asked the Philippine Coast Guard and the Department of Foreign Affairs “to put together…a map of these fishing grounds” that will be presented to Beijing.
In remarks made to reporters while on board a plane to Washington, Marcos also said a Philippines-China “direct communication line” must be finally adopted, when asked about his thoughts on a recent maritime confrontation between the two countries.
“The overall priority is to safeguard our maritime territory,” he said, in remarks issued by his office on Monday.
The Chinese embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Philippines accused China’s coastguard on Friday of “aggressive tactics” following a recent incident during a Philippine coastguard patrol close to the Philippines-held Second Thomas Shoal, a flashpoint for previous altercations located 105 nautical miles (195 km) off its coast.
The United States has urged China to stop harassing Philippine vessels in the South China Sea, while Beijing said it was willing to handle maritime differences with countries of concern through friendly consultations, while warning Washington against interference.
“This is the kind of thing that… we’re hoping to avoid, that this time it was a little more dangerous because they were close,” Marcos said. “That can cause casualties on both sides.”
China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, with a “nine-dash line” on maps that stretches more than 1,500 km (930 miles) off its mainland and cuts into the exclusive economic zones of Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia. An international arbitral ruling in 2016 dismissed that line as having no legal basis.
Ahead of his May 1 meeting with President Joe Biden in Washington, Marcos also said he would not allow his country to become a “staging post” for military action.
China has said Manila was stoking the fire of regional tensions after it recently granted Washington access to more military bases in the Philippines, as Beijing accused the United States of interfering in its affairs with Taiwan.

8,"DEFENSE POSTURE | Marcos’ US visit strategic to reaffirm close ties with security ally, says analyst",By Beatrice Puente,"May 2, 2023 ,","By Beatrice Puente
(May 2, 2023) – President Bongbong Marcos Jr.’s visit to the United States (US) is important because it would bolster the decades-old alliance between the two countries, a political analyst said on Monday.
Dindo Manhit, the president of the ADR Stratbase Institute, explained that the strong connection between the Philippines and the US is necessary in the face of China’s continuing aggression in the West Philippine Sea.
“(Marcos’ visit will touch on) how we can coordinate in ensuring this minimum defense posture for the Philippine republic as we try to protect our maritime rights and territorial integrity based on international laws. So, this is very important from a strategic point of view,” said Manhit on One News’ The Big Story.

In Marcos’ visit to the White House, US President Joe Biden told him that Washington has an “ironclad commitment” to defending the Philippines, including on the issue of the South China Sea.
“The leaders underscore their unwavering commitment to freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea and the importance of respecting the sovereign rights of states within their exclusive economic zones consistent with international law,” read their joint statement.
Biden also stressed that any armed attack on the military, public vessels, or aircraft of the Philippines in the Pacific would prompt the US to invoke its commitments under the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT).
RELATED: IRONCLAD TIES | US, Philippines recommit to security alliance amid China pressure
Before the meeting, Marcos said the MDT, which was signed in 1951, must evolve with the changing times.
“The conditions under which the MDT was written, the original one, are completely different from conditions that we’re facing now,” said Marcos.
Retired Vice Admiral Alexander Pama agreed with Marcos’ sentiment, although he noted that the 70-year-old pact might even need a reset.
“Ironclad na ‘yung commitment nila (US) na tutulungan tayo ‘pag inatake ‘yung mga barko natin sa West Philippine Sea. That’s insofar as what has been verbally stated by the US,” said Pama on One News’ The Chiefs. “It has to be written.”

Marcos has repeatedly expressed his desire to balance the country’s ties with US and China, touting a “friend to all” approach. His style is starkly different from that of his predecessor, former President Rodrigo Duterte, who pivoted his foreign policy to China while often criticizing the US.
China has continued its aggression over virtually the entire South China Sea, of which the West Philippine Sea is part. Just recently, the Philippine Coast Guard reported a near-collision between BRP Malapascua and a larger vessel of the China Coast Guard.
Manhit said these bullying tactics are nothing new.
“This is something we’ve seen in satellite pictures and reports of our own fisherfolk. It’s good that the public knows about it. It’s good that we collectively, with our other neighbors, countries that support the protection of our territory, can work together to collectively deter this aggression by China in the West Philippine Sea,” said Manhit.

10,SECURITY TIES | Biden to reassure Marcos as China tensions flare,By Trevor Hunnicutt,"May 1, 2023 ,","By Trevor Hunnicutt
WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) – President Joe Biden and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will agree on Monday to new guidelines aimed at strengthening military cooperation, said U.S. officials, underscoring a dramatic turnaround in U.S.-Philippine relations over the past year.
The new guidelines focus on military coordination across land, sea, air, space and cyberspace, while the administration will also transfer three C-130 aircraft and look to send additional patrol vessels.
Biden will also reaffirm the countries’ 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, which calls for the United States to act in the event of an armed attack on the Philippine military, said the officials in a briefing for reporters.
The meeting comes as part of a four-day U.S. visit by Marcos that started on Sunday, the first by a Philippine president in more than 10 years.
Marcos, who became president last year, has sought warm relations with both the United States and China, who are vying for influence in the Asia-Pacific region.
Under Rodrigo Duterte, Marcos’ predecessor, relations with U.S. soured as he turned the Philippines sharply away from its former colonial ruler and built closer ties with China.
But with many Filipinos frustrated by China’s actions in the South China Sea, including the harassing of Philippine ships and fishermen in parts of the sea that both countries claim, popular support has grown for a tougher stance towards Beijing.
Wariness about China’s intentions has only increased recently.
A reported comment last month by Beijing’s ambassador to Manila that the Philippines should not support Taiwan’s independence “if you care about the 150,000 overseas foreign workers” of Filipino origin who live there was viewed as a “veiled threat,” a U.S. official said.
“Some of the steps that China have taken have concerned (Marcos), probably even surprised him,” said one senior Biden administration official. “He has strong desire to work closely with both countries but finds himself in a situation that the steps that China’s taking are deeply concerning.”
“We will reaffirm our commitment to fostering our long standing alliance as an instrument of peace and as catalyst of development in the Asia Pacific region,” Marcos said before leaving for the trip on Sunday.
PHILIPPINES CENTRAL TO U.S. PLANS
For its part, the U.S. government sees the Philippines as key to any effort to counter an invasion of Taiwan by China, which claims the island as its own territory.
Experts say the United States considers the Philippines a potential location for rockets, missiles and artillery systems to counter a Chinese amphibious assault.
Biden has invested in courting Marcos, who still faces a U.S. court judgment connected with $2 billion of plundered wealth under his father’s rule. Washington helped Marcos’ father flee into exile in Hawaii during a 1986 “people power” uprising.
The U.S. president was the first official to reach out Marcos Jr. after his election and Biden has made strengthening economic and military ties in the Indo-Pacific region a cornerstone of his foreign policy.
The exact contours of a U.S.-Philippine alliance in a wartime scenario remain sketchy, including what level of access and cooperation would occur at Philippine bases where the countries’ militaries have agreed to work together.
Earlier this month, Washington and Manila added five bases to an existing list of four, including three facing north towards Taiwan and one near the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. China said the move was “stoking the fire” of regional tensions and that Washington should take no role in a conflict far away from its shores.
“We’re standing shoulder to shoulder in the South China Sea, where our alignment has never been stronger,” said one U.S. official.
Biden will also take steps in the economic sphere, including sending a trade and investment mission to Manila, supporting the roll out of 5G telecommunications technology, launching public-private financing for critical minerals and “smart” power grid development, new bilateral discussion on labor issues, and support for airport security, maritime safety and the country’s healthcare industry.
Still, security ties will be front and center, as Washington also works to deepen military collaboration between the Philippines and Japan.
Later this month, Biden heads to Japan for the Group of 7 meeting and to Australia for meetings of the Quad, a grouping which includes the United States, Japan, India and Australia. Both meetings are expected to focus heavily on China.
The United State is also actively planning a possible Biden stop in Papua New Guinea on May 22 as part of stepped-up engagement with the Pacific-island region, according to officials familiar with the matter.
