0,BI intercepts trafficking victim with fake border stamp at NAIA,By Ferdinand Patinio,,"(Photo courtesy of BI)
MANILA – The Bureau of Immigration’s (BI) Travel Control and Enforcement Unit (TCEU) has intercepted a human trafficking victim for presenting a fake border stamp on her passport.
In a statement on Friday, Immigration Commissioner Norman Tansingco said the female victim was supposed to fly to the United Arab Emirates via a Cebu Pacific flight to Dubai when she was stopped at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 3 on April 30.
Upon secondary inspection, she admitted that she was invited by her cousin who allegedly processed all her documents.
Before entering the airport, the victim said she gave her passport and boarding pass to an unknown woman riding a taxi outside the airport.
After several minutes, the woman returned and handed her an already stamped passport before going to the immigration departure area.
The BI’s forensic documents laboratory confirmed that the border stamp is counterfeit.
The TCEU officers sought the assistance of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking assigned at NAIA for standard turnover procedures.
Tansingco again warned that they are ready to stop human traffickers who would attempt to employ these schemes.
“Our officers have wide-ranging measures to detect and deter fraud. We will continue to safeguard the public against trafficking and aid in bringing these perpetrators to justice,” he added. (PNA)

MANILA – President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. has emphasized the need to forge stronger alliances and continue “developing cooperation"" with different countries to resolve soaring tensions in Taiwan.
In a conference hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC, Marcos described the situation on the island as “new,” which requires solutions to ""also be new and that is why we are now formulating those partnerships between all the different countries.”
""Patuloy ang pagpatibay natin ng ating pagsasama at pagpa-partner dito... iba’t ibang bansa na hindi lamang ‘yung mga nakapaligid sa Pilipinas. Hindi lamang ang ating karatig bansa kung hindi pati na ang mga bansa na dati hindi naman natin nakakausap dahil walang pangangailangan na magkaroon tayo ng partnership (We are continuing to strengthen our cooperation and partnership with other countries, not just our neighboring countries, but also countries that we rarely interact with because we didn't see the need to establish partnerships),” Marcos said.
He said the Philippines' arrangements and alliances with other countries should be fixed so that they conform to the ""needs of the day.""
“Not just Australia, not just the United States, also South Korea, also Japan, all of the ASEAN Member States and I think we can continue to… do that and I know that the countries… are already of the same mind,” he added.
Marcos said his campaign message of unity is beginning to extend not only to the local situation in the Philippines but also on the international scale.
""Sila rin ay naghahanap na nga ng mga – magsasama upang harapin ang bagong mundo na sabay-sabay (They, too, are looking for companions to face the new world together),"" he said.
The President also reiterated his administration's foreign policy that ""the Philippines shall continue to be a friend to all and an enemy of none.” (PNA)

2,Comelec en banc affirms disqualification of Legazpi mayor Rosal,By Ferdinand Patinio,,"Comelec facade (PNA photo by Yancy Lim)
MANILA – The Commission on Elections (Comelec) en banc affirmed the disqualification of Carmen Geraldine Rosal as a candidate for mayor of Legazpi City, Albay during the May 9, 2022 elections.
In a 17-page resolution promulgated on May 4, the seven-member en banc affirmed the ruling of its 2nd Division dated Oct. 4, 2022, disqualifying Rosal based on finding her liable for violating Section 261 (v) of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC), which prohibits the release, disbursement, or expenditure of public funds 45 days before Election Day.
“Respondent is found to have given money to influence, induce, or corrupt the voters, as described in Section 68 (a) in relation to Section 261 (a) (1) of the Omnibus Election Code. Respondent is hereby disqualified from being a candidate for Mayor of Legazpi City, Albay for the 9 May 2022 National and Local Elections,” the poll body said.
The disqualification case was filed by Joseph San Juan Armogila against Rosal over her participation in the two-day Tricycle Driver's Cash Assistance Payout in the city on March 31, 2022.
According to Comelec, Rosal did not deny that she was among those present during the activity.
It noted that a Facebook post about the activity thanked Rosal and referred to her as ""Mayor Gie Rosal,"" when she was not the incumbent mayor at the time, in an apparent reference to the position she was then running for.
The commission also found it sufficient to conclude that Rosal was among those who gave the cash assistance and that it was given ""to influence or induce them to support her candidacy for Mayor.""
“All things considered, this Commission (En Banc) is convinced that Respondent gave money in order to influence, induce, or corrupt the tricycle drivers concerned. Petitioner is found to have sufficiently proved his case by the requisite Substantial Evidence,” the Comelec added.
On the other hand, the Commission en banc ruling noted that Rosal cannot be held accountable for violating 261 (v) of the OEC because the prohibition applies only to public officials or employees.
“Respondent cannot be held accountable for violation of the prohibition against release, disbursement or expenditure of public funds during the 45-day period prior to Election Day for the simple reason that she is not a public official at the time the supposed offense was committed,” it said.
After the decision, the Comelec en banc resolved to proclaim Alfredo Garbin Jr. as the duly-elected mayor of Legazpi City for garnering the second-highest number of votes during the 2022 National and Local Elections.
“With the disqualification of herein Respondent, it is only fitting to proclaim Alfredo A. Garbin Jr., the one who garnered the second highest number of votes during the 2022 Elections, as the City Mayor of Legazpi City,” it said.
The poll body also directed the Special City Board of Canvassers of Legazpi City to convene within 10 days from the finality of the ruling, at the Comelec Session Hall, 8th Floor, Palacio del Gobernador Building in Intramuros, Manila to proclaim Garbin as the duly elected mayor of Legazpi City.
“The decision will be final and executory 5 days from service if there's no TRO (temporary restraining order) issued by the Supreme Court, which in this case, until May 9. Without a TRO, on May 10, the Resolution will be final and executory, where it was likewise ordered that until May 20, the Special City Board of Canvassers of Legazpi will convene to proclaim Alfredo Garbin Jr. as the winning candidate for Mayor,” Comelec spokesperson John Rex Laudiangco said in a statement on Friday.

""Sa palagay ko ay ganun din ang sasabihin niya na dapat papatibayin natin. At naghihingalo, hirap na hirap ang ekonomiya ng UK so baka isang bagay ‘yun na pag-uusapan namin kung papaano mag-trade, kung papaano dagdagan (I think he will say the same thing – that we should strengthen it. The UK's economy is undergoing some hardships so what we could potentially discuss is how to boost trade).”
The President said his family would land at Gatwick Airport, where he will take the opportunity to check on some “lessons learned” by airport officials and apply them in improving the Philippines’ major airports.
""Usually, hindi sa Gatwick ang pinupuntahan ngunit ngayon ay pupuntahan ko ‘yung Gatwick dahil titingnan ko ‘yung operation ng kanilang airport kung bagay ba ito – ‘yung mga lessons learned nila, ‘yung mga ginagawa nila, kung best practices ‘yan na puwede nating dalhin sa Pilipinas (Gatwick is not usually used as a gateway, but this time, I will check the airport's operations and see if there are lessons learned and best practices that can be applied in the Philippines),” he said.

8,"New defense guidelines ‘responsive’ to challenges faced by US, PH",By Filane Mikee Cervantes,,"(File photo)
MANILA – President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. on Thursday said the new United States-Philippines Bilateral Defense Guidelines, which chart their vision for alliance cooperation across all operational domains, will be responsive to the security challenges faced by both countries.
During a question and answer session at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, Marcos said ""security and defense can no longer be isolated as one issue.""
""There are attendant and ancillary issues that hope -- that helped solved the problem and that are part of the solution and so again we must really be looking towards the… for example, on the economic side, we must be looking to adjust our relationship as we all are trying to adjust and to transform our economies,” Marcos said.
In a meeting at Pentagon on Wednesday, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin reaffirmed Washington’s commitment to bolstering the Philippines’ defense capabilities as the allies develop a Security Sector Assistance Roadmap to guide shared defense modernization investments over the next five to 10 years.
The new bilateral defense guidelines aim to direct a ""whole-of government coordination"" as well as promote better coordination and bilateral planning to ensure the territorial integrity and security of both parties.
The guidelines would also institutionalize better interoperability and develop inter-agency capabilities of Philippine and American security establishments.
Marcos also stressed the need to focus on the new economy emerging from the post-pandemic world.
""And with the impacting forces of the war in Ukraine and those are some things -- these are elements, these are issues that we never really had to deal with before,” the chief executive said.
On Ukraine-Russia conflict: 'Protect sovereignty of each nation’
When asked about his takeaway from his meetings with US officials and lawmakers regarding international security, Marcos raised the need to protect the sovereignty of each nation in the face of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
""I think we are in full agreement that we must continue to protect the sovereignty, not just sovereign rights, but the sovereignty of each nation, no matter where they are and that the situation in Ukraine cannot continue and it is something that is really anachronistic in the modern world,” Marcos said.
Marcos said the Philippines had been straightforward in supporting the resolutions passed by the United Nations in the war in Ukraine.
""And that we respect the sovereignty and territoriality of every single nation in the world. And that applies most certainly because they are in this incredibly critical situation where an outright war is going on,” he said.
Marcos stressed nations should exert all possible efforts to bring peace to Ukraine. (PNA)

MANILA – President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. said his administration's campaign against illegal drugs would now focus more on dismantling drug syndicates and strengthening re-education programs.
During a question-and-answer session at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, DC on Thursday (Friday in Manila), Marcos said the drug problem continues to be the source of ""much criminality in the Philippines,"" emphasizing that there would be no letup in the anti-drug campaign despite taking on a different approach from the previous administration.
""We have taken enforcement as far as we can. Now, it is time to look at actually going after dismantling these syndicates,” Marcos said.
""Further back to that process is also... the process of re-education, of explaining, especially to our young people what the damage – what the potential damage is to their lives should they be involved in this way, not only as users, not only as addicts but also as dealers and operators of these syndicates.”
The President said he has organized a commission aimed at cleansing the ranks of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and sought the resignation of all police officers suspected of involvement in the illegal drug trade.
""We are now in the process of looking through the records of these officers to see those (who) have had derogatory comments, those that have evidence against them,” he said.

MANILA – The Philippines and the United States are “naturally drawn to each other"" and are bonded by shared values and commitment to mutual prosperity, President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. said Thursday (Friday in Manila).
In a policy speech delivered at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, DC, Marcos said Manila and Washington have seen a steady exchange of official engagements at all levels of government over the past 20 months.
These engagements, he said, include his first meeting with US President Joseph Biden on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York last year and his ongoing five-day official visit to Washington, DC, the first by a sitting Philippine president to the United States in more than 10 years.
The President said the future of the US would hold more promise if it works ""hand-in-hand, shoulder-to-shoulder, in lockstep"" with the Philippines.
“Our two countries are drawn to each other because we recognize that in order to achieve our common goal of peace and prosperity for our peoples, we need to work with like-minded partners,"" he said.

MANILA – The National Water Resources Board (NWRB) on Thursday urged the public to help the government mitigate the impact of the looming El Niño phenomenon by conserving water.
“Habang tayo po sa pamahalaan ay ginagawa po natin kung papaano mabigyan ng seguridad iyong tubig na pangangailangan po ng mga kababayan po natin, mas maganda po na tumulong din po ang publiko at mga kababayan po natin sa pamamagitan po ng tamang paggamit po ng tubig (While we in the government are trying to secure the water that we need, it is better for the public to help through proper use of water),” said NWRB executive director Sevillo David Jr. during the Laging Handa media forum.
He said President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. has already made a directive to intensify water conservation measures “so that we can prepare for the possible effect of El Niño.”
He said all government agencies under the El Niño Team created by President Marcos are now discussing the possible mitigating measures or contingency plans to lessen the impact of the El Niño phenomenon.
David said the reactivation of deep wells and the water treatment facilities are now in place.
He said the water allocation for irrigation from Angat Dam has been reduced to maintain stable water supply for 2,000 hectares of agricultural lands, particularly in the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga.
The Angat Dam’s water level remains at “normal operation level” of 194.4 meters, he said.

Marcos Jr. delivers a message to American business executives in Washington on Wednesday (April 4, 2023). Marcos said the Philippines must transform to keep the economy moving and growing and be part of the new world. (Photo courtesy of Office of the President FB page)
MANILA – President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. on Wednesday (Thursday Manila time) said the Philippines must pursue economic ""transformation"", rather than just mere economic recovery, in order for the country to thrive in a post-pandemic world.
In his remarks during the fireside chat with US businesses at the Blair House in Washington, President Marcos said he does not want the Philippines to be back where it was in mid-2019 right before the Covid-19 hit.
He said the country must “transform” to keep the economy moving and growing after the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“I do not view it as they said how do we get out of this hole? The hole that the pandemic put us in? I said: ‘Well I see it in a different way.’ I think because – that’s why I do not use ‘recovery’, the word recovery, I use the word transformation. Because we are not trying to recover to where we used to be. We are trying to transform ourselves to be part of the modern world,” he said.
“Now, that transformation I think will occur, I think it is a grand opportunity that we have been given. Now we do not start from a blank sheet of paper but it’s close... And many, many new sectors that did not exist before. There are businesses that did not exist before that will be very dominant in the very near future,” he added.
The economic transformation, he said, could be achieved with the help of the young workforce with an average age of between 23 and 24.
He further described the young workforce as well trained and proficient in the English language, noting that they are ""perfectly capable of engaging in these activities around the world.”
“Well, the optimism, number one, comes from our workforce. I have a 107 million population and 60 percent of that are working. And those – we have the youngest, we have the youngest I don’t know in the world but certainly in Asia,” he said.
He expressed optimism that pursuing economic transformation is the ""right approach"", especially now that the effects can be perceived as the government structures the Philippine economy for stronger investment and more well-structured value chains both in the service sector and in the manufacturing sector.
Bringing more foreign investments in
Marcos also touted the administration's efforts minimize red tape and digitalize the bureaucratic processes to help accelerate foreign direct investment (FDI) and bring businesses into the Philippines.
He pointed out that the Anti-Red Tape Authority (ARTA) has succeeded in streamlining some of the permitting process to ensure ease of doing business in the country.
“They have done a very good job. They have reduced some of the permitting procedures from --- for different industries from several months to just a few days,” Marcos said told the business executives
He, however, said the challenge is how to compete with other countries and how to shorten the business permitting process, which sometimes takes 36 months to secure in the Philippines.
For comparison, documents are ready for signature after 24 hours in other countries, he noted.
The President said another area that the administration is working on is digitalizing government processes and transactions.
“We always --- that’s why digitalization has become such an important part of our effort because with digitalization, you remove as much of the discretion that we will have --- that people have in actually processing these applications or these documents and hopefully the end result is that --- we will be doing most of our business in government purely online, without speaking to a human being,” he said.
Citing a study, Marcos said 95 percent of today’s work is done online, adding that although digitalizing the bureaucracy may be an intimidating task the government must carry it out. (PNA)

13,ACG reminds vloggers to exercise diligence in content creation,By Christopher Lloyd Caliwan,,"MANILA – The Philippine National Police-Anti-Cybercrime Group (ACG) on Thursday reminded vloggers and content creators to be responsible in creating videos that they upload on social media.
In a statement, ACG director Brig Gen. Sidney Hernia said while prank videos can be entertaining and amusing, some creators are going too far which results in the production of dangerous, illegal and disturbing content.
“We take this issue seriously and will hold those responsible accountable for their actions. Vloggers must be aware that their content can significantly impact the public and ensure that they are not putting anyone’s safety or well-being at risk,"" Hernia said in a statement.
This comes in the wake of a surge in videos of ""dangerous pranks"" online such as fake robberies or attacks, which have caused fear and panic in public places, disrupted public services and endangered the safety of others.
Hernia said these pranks have the potential to lead to serious injuries or even fatalities, and those involved in staging them could face criminal charges.
He also said the ACG is exerting efforts to take down the video of a prank kidnapping in Las Piñas City staged by the vloggers known as the ""Tukomi Brothers"".
A police officer identified as Staff Sgt. Ronnie Comingo witnessed the incident and drew his handgun on the vloggers, thinking it was a real kidnapping incident.
“The prank has caused considerable distress to those who witnessed it, and the video must be removed from all platforms,” Hernia said.
The vloggers who were wearing bonnets later raised their hands and declared that the incident was merely a prank kidnapping, thus pacifying the policeman.
One of the vloggers approached Conmingo and clarified it was just a prank as the policeman was initially hesitant but later put his handgun down after he was certain it was a stunt.
With the incident, Conmingo filed a complaint against them before the city prosecutor’s office.
Hernia also appealed to the public to report to the PNP any content that are harmful and dangerous.
“By working together, we can create a safer and more responsible online environment for everyone,"" Hernia added.
The PNP warned other vloggers never to make jokes about crimes as they could be held accountable for tumultuous and other disturbances of public order, which carries a prison term of six years. (PNA)

14,"DOTr eyes NPO, APO services over driver’s license shortage",By Raymond Carl Dela Cruz,,"MANILA – The Department of Transportation (DOTr) is looking at coordinating with two recognized government printers to produce driver’s license cards to stem the current shortage, with many drivers being issued paper licenses instead.
In a statement on Thursday, the DOTr said exploratory talks are ongoing with the National Printing Office (NPO) -- a government-run printer that produces government standard forms used in the collection of taxes, fees and others in the course of government transactions.
“Sa ngayon ay nasa ‘exploratory stage’ ang pakikipag-ugnayan ng Kalihim sa NPO Director upang alamin ang mga posibleng mangyayari sakaling kunin ang serbisyo ng ahensya (For now, the discussion between DOTr Secretary Jaime Bautista and the NPO Director are at the exploratory stage to find out whether we can avail of their service),” it said.
In addition, Bautista is also looking into coordinating with the APO Production Unit (APO) -- a government-owned and controlled corporation that is also a recognized government printer similar to the NPO.
“Batay sa umiiral na mga batas at regulasyon, kailangan ng Central Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) ng karagdagang detalye bago isapinal ang ‘agency-to-agency arrangement’ sa pamamagitan ng Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) [Based on the prevailing laws and regulations the Central BAC needs more information before finalizing an ‘agency-to-agency arrangement’ through a MOA],” it said.
To date, it said the Central BAC is holding a “competitive bidding” for the procurement of these license cards, with the deadline set on May 24.
The Central BAC, it said, is also working with prospective bidders on any issues or comments on the terms of reference submitted by the Land Transportation Office (LTO) on March 21.
Earlier, the LTO announced it will be printing driver’s licenses on paper as it runs out of the necessary cards, with license plates for both motorcycles and motor vehicles also set to run out by June and July respectively.
LTO chief Assistant Secretary Jose Arturo “Jay Art” Tugade noted that the DOTr -- as head of procuring entity for these materials -- moved the submission of bids from April 24 to May 24, creating an additional delay.
On the other hand, Bautista responded that the LTO only began the procurement process for license cards and plates in March when they should have started the procurement in August last year when the 2023 budget was submitted to Congress. (PNA)

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issued on Tuesday an El Niño alert, noting this might emerge in the second half of the year and could persist until early 2024.
BFAR national director lawyer Demosthenes Escoto said the weather phenomenon has positive and negative impacts on the local supply.
Escoto said El Niño may be favorable to archipelagic species, such as tuna and sardines, because these organisms prefer warmer temperatures.
However, he said it may have a negative effect to land-based aquaculture species like bangus and tilapia since lower water levels may also mean scarcity of dissolved oxygen in their habitat.
Escoto assured that the local fisherfolk could cushion the impact of El Niño on their catch by following good aquaculture practices, such as having the appropriate stock or number of fingerlings in their cages so they would not lack oxygen, thus lessening the probability of fish kill occurrence.
He added BFAR also intensified the information, education, and communication campaigns among fish farmers; boosting production of fish farming in cages in the mariculture parks; and ensuring sufficiency of fry and fingerlings.
The BFAR will also continue to closely monitor algae bloom for possible red tide occurrence and provide technical assistance on fish disease detection and treatment, among others.
Escoto said supply and prices of fish in local markets remain stable at present.
Citing the DA-BFAR’s latest price monitoring report, Escoto said a kilo of bangus costs PHP120 to PHP160, while prices of tilapia range from PHP130 to PHP150 per kilo.
Local fresh galunggong, meanwhile, are priced at PHP200 per kilo. (PNA)

16,Public urged to focus on protection amid rising positivity rate,By Ma. Teresa Montemayor,,"MANILA – The Department of Health on Thursday advised the public to focus more on layers of protection such as vaccination amid the rise in Covid-19 cases.
This, after the OCTA Research Group reported that the positivity rate or the number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the National Capital Region (NCR) increased to 19.7 percent as of May 2.
""The positivity rate is not the sole criterion in monitoring our Covid-19 situation. There are many factors or measures to consider as to an area’s increase in COVID-19 cases,"" the DOH said in a Viber message to reporters.
""This means metrics such as transmission rate, contact rate, and longer durations of infectiousness are not sole drivers of transmission and increases in cases,"" it added.
The DOH also emphasized that the public must keep an eye on the healthcare utilization rates and monitor the situation in our admissions in the hospitals.
As of April 30, only 3,157 or 18.1 percent of 17,480 non-intensive care unit (ICU) beds are utilized. Meanwhile, only 303 or 15 percent of 2,021 ICU beds were utilized.
On Tuesday, DOH officer in charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said that the positivity rate should not be the sole basis of the country’s Covid-19 situation.
The positivity rate is expected to increase because the individuals tested are those most likely to be positive as the shift in testing protocols to focus more on symptomatic individuals, she said.
She also urged the public to get vaccinated, receive their booster shots against Covid-19 and wear face masks. (PNA)

“We shall begin with a series of oversight meetings on the budget performance of departments, agencies, and corporations of the national government funded under the FY 2022 GAA and for the 1st Quarter of FY 2023 GAA,” Quimbo said.
She said Appropriations Committee chairperson, Rep. Elizaldy Co, is committed to actively pursuing the monitoring and compliance by agencies with the requirements and/or conditions in the utilizations of public funds as provided under Section 29, Article VI of the 1987 Constitution.
“Under the oversight power of the Committee on Appropriations, we are responsible for ensuring that the appropriations under the GAA are utilized and disbursed timely, effectively, and efficiently in accordance with the intent of Congress,” she said. “Additionally, to recommend whether or not these activities or projects be pursued, curtailed, or eliminated in the budget proposal for the next budget year to be authorized by Congress.”

18,"AirAsia PH mulls flight adjustments on May 16, 17",By Ma. Cristina Arayata,,"(Photo courtesy of MIAA)
MANILA – Low-cost carrier AirAsia Philippines announced Thursday it made a proposal to make adjustments on some of its flights scheduled on May 16 and 17.
The country's airspace will close for six hours on May 17. 
A corrective maintenance at the Philippine Air Traffic Management Center is scheduled from midnight to 6 a.m. on May 17, but normal operations will resume as soon as the activity is finished.
In a public briefing Thursday, Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines spokesperson Eric Apolonio said the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) will be replaced, and the air traffic management system will be upgraded during that period.
This activity can be finished in about 4.5 hours, but the CAAP allocated six hours so that flights won't be affected should there be issues that need to be fixed, he said.
With this, AirAsia said a proposed rescheduling of 21 flights on May 16, retiming of 13 flights and cancellation of six flights on May 17, was brought up to aviation officials.
The airline said it is eyeing to reschedule flights to and from Taipei, Incheon, Bangkok, Kota Kinabalu, and Incheon, as well as flights to and from Cebu, Bacolod, Davao, Puerto Princesa, Cagayan, Iloilo, and Tacloban. Cancellation will include flights from Manila to Davao, Cebu, and Bacolod and their return flights that are covered within the maintenance period.
AirAsia Philippines deputy spokesperson Carlo Carongoy said they will update the list once they get the approval from the slot allocation committee.
""AirAsia has made adequate preparations to notify guests in advance via SMS and registered email of the flight schedule changes. It also prepared a massive information dissemination campaign through its quad media partners and social media pages,"" the airline said.
Meanwhile, Apolonio advised the passengers to coordinate with the airlines to know if their flight schedules have been adjusted.
He also apologized to the public, saying the maintenance activity aims to improve the system and avoid the glitch that happened last Jan. 1.
To recall, thousands of passenger were then affected when hundreds of flights were delayed, canceled and diverted to other regional airports due to the technical issues in the air traffic management system. (PNA)

19,Immigration officer in hot water over links to human trafficking,By Ferdinand Patinio,,"(File photo)
MANILA – A male immigration officer will face an administrative case for supposedly facilitating the departure of a couple who are reportedly victims of trafficking in Myanmar, the Bureau of Immigration (BI) said on Thursday.
Immigration Commissioner Norman Tansingco, in a statement, said the officer has been removed from his post for his involvement in the case of the couple who worked as love scammers and arrived home on April 25 after escaping their employers.
Tansingco warned immigration personnel not to be involved in illegal cross-border activities.
""If you are innocent, I will defend you. But if I find out that you are involved, you will know the consequence of your action. I don't care who your backer is,"" he said.
According to the victims, they experienced physical abuse, threats, and starvation as consequences for not reaching their quota.
Both claimed that they were recruited via social media by a certain Maxesa and left the country in October 2022 purportedly for a four-day vacation in Singapore.
The two noted that from Singapore, they flew to Bangkok and were transported by armed men to Mae Sot City to eventually take a boat ride to Myanmar. After their successful escape, they sought assistance from the Philippine Embassy in Thailand.
Meanwhile, the BI also reported the rescue of two trafficking victims at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 1.
The women were intercepted on separate occasions on April 28 and 29 as they were about to board their flights to Dubai.
Tansingco said the two were stopped from leaving after immigration officers at the airport found that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) employment visa that they presented was counterfeit.
The victims claimed that they obtained their travel documents only at the airport, a few hours before their scheduled flights and they did not know that the papers given to them were spurious.
“These syndicates have no sympathy or concern at all for the well-being of their victims. They prey on our poor countrymen who are lured to their evil ways because of their ardent desire to earn a living abroad in order to support their families here,” he said.
The BI’s travel control and enforcement unit reported that the passengers were both referred for secondary inspection after BI officers noticed that the overseas employment certificates they presented could not be validated in the database of the Department of Migrant Workers. Upon verification, it was determined that their UAE employment visas were also fraudulent.
The women were turned over to the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking for investigation and assistance in filing cases against their recruiters.
Last month, the bureau also relieved another officer from his post for allegedly helping clear passengers who attempted to board a flight to Lebanon to work as household service workers.
The women were allegedly being trafficked to work in the Middle East.
The passengers, initially disguised as tourists, said they would go on a tour but later confessed that their final destination is Lebanon, where they were recruited to work. (PNA)

MANILA – President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. on Wednesday made a pitch to American businessmen the plan of the Philippines to pursue local battery production, with the help of foreign technology and capital, as a solution for the country’s problems in energy supply and other energy-related issues.
During a fireside chat at the Blair House in Washington with US businessmen, Marcos underscored the great potential of local battery production as the government endeavors to move the Philippines’ energy mix from traditional fossil fuels to renewables.
“And the part that batteries will play in that whole system cannot be overstated. And that is why it would be very good if we could bring the industry into the Philippines,” Marcos said, adding that battery production is an important pivot for the country with the advent of climate change.
He said for the country to go beyond mineral extraction to actual battery production to prop up the local value chain, technology and strong industry participation are needed to see this materialize.
“But to do that we need technology, we need of course the capital and the resources to undertake such activities. They are not small projects and so they require major funding and that again is another part of the situation that we have to deal with,"" he said.
Marcos said there are many new instruments that encouraged this activity in the last few years such as green bonds and blue bonds and current rules have become very, very clear.
In his talks with big companies, especially mining companies, Marcos said buyers of mineral products insist upon declaration of proof that the products that they are being sold were built using green energy.
“And that I think is going to be an important part in making hopefully the manufacturing of batteries in the Philippines a success,” he said. (PNA)

21,LTO to simplify driver’s license exams to combat fixers,By Raymond Carl Dela Cruz,,"LTO chief Assistant Secretary Jose Arturo ""Jay Art"" Tugade (PNA photo)
MANILA – The Land Transportation Office (LTO) is looking to shorten its driver’s licensure exams in a bid to simplify transactions and lessen the public’s reliance on fixers.
In a statement on Thursday, LTO chief Assistant Secretary Jose Arturo “Jay Art” Tugade said “lengthy procedures” is one of the reasons why many license applicants resort to paying for fixers -- third-party unauthorized agents who process LTO transactions for a fee.
“The instruction I gave to our committee was to compress the exam. This exam reportedly takes about an hour. The agency is now studying how to shorten the exam. I believe that by reducing the exam duration, our applicants will not seek out fixers and will opt to take the exam themselves,” Tugade said.
The committee, he said, will analyze exam questions and condense the content without sacrificing their purpose to license competent drivers with emphasis on knowledge, skills, and attitude.
The shortened exams being studied are for new non-professional licenses, new conductor’s licenses, changing classification from non-professional to professional, and adding a driver’s license code.
In addition to shortening the exams, he said the committee will also look into customizing exam questions depending on the license classification or driver’s license code the applicant is applying for. (PNA)

22,Solon wants proactive gov't action vs. future avian flu outbreaks,By Leonel Abasola,,"(File photo)
MANILA – A lawmaker on Thursday filed a resolution seeking a Senate inquiry to determine the appropriate government actions to prevent and control the possible outbreak of the avian influenza virus in the country.
""It is high time for the Senate to ensure that risk-based planning, strict prevention protocol, and proactive legislative action are in place to minimize public health risks and fundamentally, to accord our local poultry sector with the support and opportunity as active partners in development and nation building,"" Senator Francis Tolentino said in filing Senate Resolution 580.
Reports submitted by the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) showed that as of Feb. 9, nine regions remained affected by avian flu.
According to the BAI report submitted to the National Banner Program Committee on Poultry and Livestock on Feb. 14, more than 300,000 poultry mortalities have been recorded since the bird flu outbreak in 2022.
The World Organization for Animal Health earlier warned that the presence of avian flu ""may restrict international trade in poultry meat that can heavily impact economies.""
In May 2022, the A-H5 variant outbreak in wild birds and poultry was reported to have spread to 16 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, the United States, and Canada, with the first human infection recorded in Ecuador in January 2023. This also led to the deaths of hundreds of sea lions and pelicans in Peru.
Tolentino said reports on the inventories of imported chicken in various commercial public wet markets in Metro Manila showed that they were sourced from Brazil, the US, Netherlands, or Canada with expiration dates ranging from 1 year to 2 years from the date of production; or have no labels on the date of production and distribution; or do not have a sticker from the National Meat Inspection Service.
""The sale of the said imported poultry meat brazenly violates the provisions of the law under Republic Act No. 7394, or the 'Consumer Act of the Philippines'... It fails to qualify with the Philippine National Standards on the Code of Hygienic Practice for the Sale of Fresh Agriculture and Fishery Products in Markets and Authorized Outlets,"" he said in his explanatory note.
He warned that the high inventory of imported poultry products amid the unabated importation of finished goods poses a “significant threat” to the immediate and long-term prospects of the local poultry sector in the county, and puts consumers at risk of the potential adverse effect of other transboundary diseases.
“There should be a clear and solid policy from authorities to avert and ward off any possible outbreak of transboundary animal diseases in the country due to the unabated importation of poultry products since it will ultimately lead to adverse public health effects and demise of the Philippine local poultry industry,” Tolentino said.

23,PH crime rate down 11.36% in first 4 months of 2023,By Christopher Lloyd Caliwan,,"PNP Public Information Office (PIO) chief Col. Redrico Maranan (File photo)
MANILA – The country's crime rate has dropped by 11.36 percent in the first four months of this year, a ranking police official said Thursday.
In a Laging Handa briefing, Philippine National Police (PNP) Public Information Office chief Col. Redrico Maranan said a total of 12,226 crime incidents were recorded from January 1 to May 2, as compared to 13,763 crimes in the same period last year.
“Nakapagbaba tayo ng 1,500 plus na krimen at iyan po ay iyong mga eight focused crimes. Kaya nakikita natin, iyong ating different anti-criminality strategies, nakikita naman natin na ito po ay epektibo (We were able to reduce 1,500 plus crimes of the so-called eight focus crimes. That's why we see, our different anti-criminality strategies, we see that it is effective),” he added.
The eight focus crimes include murder, homicide, physical injury, robbery, theft, vehicle theft, motorcycle theft and rape.
Index crimes are serious crimes such as murder, homicide, physical injury, robbery, rape, theft, and carjacking, while non-index crimes are violations of local ordinances and laws and vehicular accidents.
Maranan said that under PNP chief Gen. Benjamin Acorda Jr.'s leadership, the PNP will deploy policemen in barangays identified by the local police forces as crime-prone areas as part of preemptive efforts against criminality.
“The focus of our new PNP chief, Gen. Acorda, is to assign police to crime-prone barangays. We have already identified that and that will be the priority of our deployment… in the crime-prone barangays. And we have also identified police regional offices that will be the ones to lead because in their area of responsibility, that's where we saw those barangays with the most crime occurring,” he added.
Maranan earlier said the move is a strategic action plan as the national police do not have enough manpower to guard over 100 million Filipinos across the country.
Maranan explained that police visibility has been proven as a crime deterrent over the years.
He emphasized the importance of the cooperation of the barangay officials in maintaining peace and order.
He said that strong coordination between the police and the community lies on the cooperation between the two, adding that it is the police commanders who are given the task to initiate it.
“The PNP cannot deploy policemen in each of the barangay. What we do is to cluster the barangay and then we either put up Police Community Precincts, police assistance desks or even a police outpost. We believe that if this is properly implemented, we would be able to reduce the crime, especially in the crime-prone barangays,"" he added. (PNA)

MANILA – The Commission on Elections (Comelec) is looking to use two automated election systems (AES) for the 2025 midterm elections.
In a press conference at the poll body's main office in Intramuros, Manila on Thursday, Comelec chairperson George Garcia disclosed that they want to work with the manufacturer of the machines, as they want to customize the systems to be used in the polls.
“We put on the Terms of Reference (TOR), we want to deal with the manufacturer. We don't want to be just an integrator. What we want is to customize, build the machine for the Comelec. We want to have our own software and we have the option to buy the software, even the hardware,” he said.
Garcia added that the AES they are looking to use are the Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) and Optical Mark Reader (OMR).
“It is a combination of OMR and DRE. We have utilized the OMR, while the DRE is touchscreen. What we want (is) if manufacturers have such (a) combination,” Garcia said. “The recommendation of the Comelec Advisory Council is also the same as what we want, OMR/DRE.”
The Comelec head noted that they plan to use the DRE for Overseas Voting and the OMR for the domestic polls.
Asked if both AES would be used at the same time, Garcia said, “No, only one AES will be used. The other feature will be disabled. If the DRE is being used, the OMR will be dissolved and vice versa.”
As for the transmission package, Garcia said they would come up with a separate TOR.
“There will be a separate TOR for transmission because the Comelec would like to make sure that it is in full control and that the telcos (telecommunications companies) that will win the procurement will report directly to us. All other collaterals, software, hardware, it’s with the winning bidder,” he said.
At the same time, Garcia noted that they could revise the TOR in case some of the features are not available in the market.
“The Commission en banc voted unanimously on the TOR. In case we were informed that it is not available in the market, we can easily revise the TOR. But this early, we want the manufacturers to know what we need. We can procure by July this year so that we can award by January or February next year and then we will conduct end-to-end testing,” he said. “Take note, this is lease with option to purchase. We don't want to purchase yet since we would like to try the system first... Finally, (the) machine should be upgradeable so this can be used in future elections.”
Earlier, the poll body said they are no longer using the 97,000 vote counting machines that were used in the past three elections. (PNA)

Romualdez said the House of Representatives is ready to take up the challenge of strengthening the long-standing ties between the two nations through consistent engagements of each country’s lawmakers.
“We, at the House of Representatives, welcome the suggestion of President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" R.

“We are ready to take up that challenge and we look forward to more engagements with our counterparts in the United States in the future,” he added.
On Wednesday, Marcos and members of his delegation met with key members of the US Senate and discussed with them various issues that include security, defense, agriculture and climate change mitigation, economic cooperation and cyber security.
During the meeting, Marcos thanked Senator Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and other members of the panel for welcoming his delegation to Capitol Hill.
It was also during the said meeting when Marcos noted that engagements between Manila and Washington should not only take place at the executive department but also with members of the legislature of both governments.
“While the conduct of foreign relations is largely the domain of the Executive, engagements between the lawmakers of both countries would be of immense value in, for instance, harmonizing the legal framework governing their bilateral relations,” Romualdez noted.
He added that with closer personal relations engendered through such engagements, the lawmakers of both countries would help deepen the level of appreciation and understanding on issues of mutual concern and thus promote even closer cooperation and partnership.
“We have actually taken the initiative to move toward the direction suggested by President Marcos,” Romualdez said.
It could be recalled that in mid-April, Speaker Romualdez along with several members of the House, flew to the United States where they engaged with key congressional leaders to lay the groundwork for the official visit of Marcos to the United States. (PNA)

MANILA – President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. has called for the renewal of the Philippines’ participation in the United States Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) trade program.
In a speech at a forum organized by the US-ASEAN Business Council and US Chamber of Commerce roundtable and reception at the Blair House in Washington DC on Wednesday (US time), Marcos said the program would increase trade with the US and promote competition.
The country’s eligibility for the US GSP program, which allows the duty-free entry of several Philippine products to the US market, expired on Dec. 31, 2020.
“We would like to request for reauthorization… to boost trade and to make US products that are made in the Philippines more competitive,"" he said.
Invest in PH
Aside from strengthening trade relations between the two countries, the President also called on US companies to invest more in the Philippines as the country has stepped up efforts to “create an atmosphere that is attractive to potential investors and we continue that process.”
He touted before American business executives the Philippine economy’s growth, which stood at 7.6 percent last year.
“This is the effect of our very aggressive efforts really to promote the Philippines as an investment destination,” Marcos said. “We will never, at any point, say we got it perfected. We will continue to listen to you and to all our other partners as to what else we can do to help transform our economy and, in that way, to be able to play a viable part in the security and defense issues that are the challenges of the day and of the region.”
He noted that the US-Philippines alliance is in the “front and center right now,"" overcoming ""some bumps and scrapes"" over the past years, as he emphasized that defense and security remain the priority areas of cooperation.
“But now, the security and defense are top of mind… we also have to see that because our economies and our societies have grown more complex, everything, it hinges on everything else and… it is very hard for us to separate and say that this is a discreet sector that does not affect any other sector,” he said.
Marcos also highlighted the government's efforts to advance the digital transformation of the Philippines, particularly supporting the “smart industry readiness” of several semiconductor and electronics manufacturing services companies “to help them craft their digital transformation roadmaps.""
The President said the country is also optimistic about the future increase in exports of solar and photovoltaic-related products from the Philippines as many countries strive to comply with their decarbonization targets.
He noted that with the trend toward electric vehicles, Philippine exports geared towards electric vehicle use, such as wire harnesses, rubber tires, and automotive electronics have good potential.
Marcos said the country is also optimistic about increasing its exports of solar and photovoltaic-related products from the Philippines as many countries strive to comply with their decarbonization targets.
The semiconductor industry, on the other hand, can gain more from increasing skills in research and development, he pointed out.

28,Legarda wants tax incentives for salt industry investors,,,"(File photo)
MANILA – To revitalize the country’s salt industry and reduce our dependence on importation, Senate President Pro Tempore Loren Legarda is batting for the passage of a measure that seeks to provide attractive incentives to industry investors.
In pushing for Senate Bill No. 1870, or an Act Strengthening and Revitalizing the Development of the Salt Industry in the Philippines, Legarda, in a press release said on Thursday, that the country’s salt industry has the potential to be a significant driver of economic growth and income-generating opportunities for the Filipino people.
She pointed out that the possibilities of the salt industry for the Philippines' overall economic performance are endless, but noted that over the past years, the country has been importing around 550,000 metric tons of salt, equivalent to 93 percent of the nation's salt requirement.
The Philippine Association of Salt Industry Networks (PhilAsin) expects these numbers to increase in the coming years because of the rapidly growing population.
Thus, Legarda said that government support is vital in addressing the challenges and gaps in making the salt industry competitive, reduce dependence on importation, and create more conducive jobs for salt farmers.
To boost local production, the advocate for sustainable livelihood programs emphasized providing substantial and attractive incentives to investors.
The lawmaker added that salt farmers should be given priority through financial and technical assistance that can promote sustainable salt production.
These can be through machines, new technologies, and elaborated research and development studies to identify further and support the industry's changing needs, she said.
Likewise, more improved policies should be considered, as well as a diverse collaboration between government agencies and stakeholders that will shepherd the formulation and implementation of the Philippine Salt Industry Development Roadmap.
""As legislators, the future of the salt industry lies in our hands. We should all consider this a shared aspiration and commitment to act tirelessly to save what's left of the industry. We will all benefit from this sector's potential for our nation's inclusive growth,"" Legarda said. (Leonel Abasola/PNA)

30,"Attacks vs. US, PH ships, aircraft in Pacific, SCS to trigger MDT",By Priam Nepomuceno,,"US Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III (left) and Department of National Defense chief Carlito Galvez Jr. (right) (File photo)
MANILA – The Bilateral Defense Guidelines between the United States and the Philippines have emphasized that an attack in the Pacific, including any part of the South China Sea against public vessels, aircraft or armed forces of the two nations will result in the invocation of the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) commitments.
""The guidelines reaffirm that an armed attack in the Pacific, including anywhere in the South China Sea, on either of their public vessels, aircraft, or armed forces – which includes their Coast Guards – would invoke mutual defense commitments under Articles IV and V of the 1951 US-Philippines MDT,"" it added.
The guidelines were established on Wednesday by Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and his Filipino counterpart Carlito Galvez Jr.
""Recognizing that threats may arise in several domains – including land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace – and take the form of asymmetric, hybrid, and irregular warfare and gray-zone tactics, the guidelines chart a way forward to build interoperability in both conventional and non-conventional domains,"" it noted.
The Bilateral Defense Guidelines also aims to modernize alliance cooperation in service of the United States and the Philippines’ shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific Region.
The guidelines are informed by the following goals with the aim of strengthening the United States and the Philippines’ combined deterrence in an evolving security environment, including:
-- Reaffirm the US-Philippines MDT’s enduring relevance in addressing both current and emerging threats;-- Foster a common understanding of roles, missions, and capabilities within the framework of the alliance to face regional and global security challenges;
-- Drive unity of effort across all areas of bilateral security and defense cooperation to sustain focus on principal regional security concerns; and;
-- Guide priority areas of defense cooperation to address both conventional and non-conventional security challenges of shared concern.
The guidelines identify multiple lines of effort to advance these objectives, including the following:
Modernizing defense capabilities
-- Coordinate closely on the Philippines’ defense modernization, including through the completion of a Security Sector Assistance Roadmap, to identify priority defense platforms and force packages that will bolster combined deterrence and capacity to resist coercion.
-- Prioritize the procurement of interoperable defense platforms sourced from US programs and Philippine national defense procurement and funding initiatives.
-- Expand investments in non-materiel defense capacity building including through education and training exchanges, exercises, and other operational activities.  
Deepen interoperability
-- Orient bilateral exercises and activities around improving our combined ability to counter armed attacks on either country as well as threats in space and cyberspace, while expanding the scope, scale, and complexity of exercises.
-- Expand cooperation on maritime security and maritime domain awareness, including through the continued conduct of combined maritime activities, including but not limited to joint patrols.
-- Deepen cooperation under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) to strengthen interoperability, including through infrastructure improvements; enhanced joint use of facilities; advancement of additional maritime security, maritime domain awareness, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief capabilities; and rotational US access to agreed locations.
-- Enhance bilateral planning and information-sharing.
-- Conduct coordinated analysis, tabletop exercises, and training and exercises to reinvigorate bilateral planning and coordination efforts; assess bilateral requirements; and advance common objectives and approaches to shared challenges.
-- Develop adaptable decision-making processes and communication procedures to support flexible, timely, whole-of-government bilateral coordination and action to respond to conventional and unconventional warfare.
-- Broaden information sharing on early indicators of threats to the peace and security of both countries to ensure preparedness to address principal challenges confronting the alliance.
-- Strive toward real-time information sharing in collaboration with other departments and agencies to support deeper interoperability and operational coordination.
-- Enhance information security through consultations on policies, practices, and procedures for the protection of classified defense and military information.
Combat transnational and non-conventional threats
-- Improve cyber defense and cyber security cooperation to secure critical infrastructure and protect against attacks emanating from state and non-state actors.
-- Pursue capacity-building activities to respond to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear-related attacks and to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Contribute to global and regional peace and security.
-- Sustain participation in multilateral fora, anchored in shared support for ASEAN centrality.
-- Prioritize trilateral and other forms of multilateral cooperation based on common issues of shared concern, including pursuing opportunities for third-party participation and observation in bilateral US-Philippine defense activities. (PNA)

32,"OCD urges public to heed El Niño advisories, warnings",By Priam Nepomuceno,,"(PNA photo by Yancy Lim)
MANILA – The Office of Civil Defense (OCD) reminded the public to heed authorities’ advisories on El Niño and implement necessary measures in preparation for the impacts of the phenomenon.
This came after the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) raised its monitoring status from El Niño watch to El Niño alert on Tuesday.
In a memorandum dated May 3, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) directed regional DRRMCs and OCD regional offices to implement preparedness actions which include close monitoring of warnings from PAGASA, issuance of reminders on water and energy conservation, the maintenance of water distribution systems to prevent wastage.
This also includes the strengthening of risk communication and localization of warnings and reminders to communities, adherence to the public health advisory for El Niño and minimum health standards for Covid-19 issued by the Department of Health, and the submission of regular reports to NDRRM Operations Center.
An interagency meeting was also held last April 24 which was presided by OCD Administrator Undersecretary Ariel Nepomuceno. Nepomuceno emphasized the need to identify and harmonize short term solutions, medium term and long term solutions of concerned government agencies for the El Niño phenomenon.
The composition of the proposed El Niño team to be led by the Department of the Interior and Local Government, was presented by OCD which also serves as team co-chair, with the Department of Agriculture, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Department of Energy, Department of Health, Department of Science and Technology, National Economic and Development Authority, National Irrigation Administration and Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System as members.
It has a support team composed of the Presidential Communications Office, Department of Trade and Industry, National Water Resources Board and Armed Forces of the Philippines.
On Wednesday, various government agencies met to discuss updates and the ways forward in preparation for El Niño.
“Let’s work together to make sure that we will be able to comply with the President’s (Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.) guidance and do what is expected from us in the first place,” OCD deputy administrator Assistant Secretary Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV said in a statement.
The El Niño Watch was in effect from March 23 to May 1 before PAGASA raised the monitoring status to El Niño Alert.
“PAGASA has been continuously monitoring the developing El Niño conditions in the tropical Pacific. Recent conditions and model forecasts indicate that El Niño may emerge in the coming season (June-July-August) at 80 percent probability and may persist until the first quarter of 2024. With this development, the PAGASA El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Alert and Warning System is now raised to El Niño Alert,” the state weather bureau said in its advisory.
El Niño increases the likelihood of below normal rainfall conditions which could bring negative impacts such as dry spells and droughts in some areas of the country, PAGASA added. (PNA)

33,Scattered rain showers continue over most of PH,By Ma. Cristina Arayata,,"MANILA – The Visayas and some parts of Luzon and Mindanao will continue to experience rain showers due to the low pressure area (LPA) and the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), the weather bureau said Thursday.
These weather systems will bring scattered rain showers and thunderstorms over the Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, Palawan, Romblon, Masbate, Catanduanes, Albay, Sorsogon, Dinagat Islands, Surigao del Norte and Surigao del Sur.
The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said these areas may experience flash floods or landslides due to moderate with at times heavy rains.
The LPA last tracked 130 kilometers southeast of Cuyo, Palawan and is embedded along the ITCZ has a moderate to high chance of developing into a weak tropical cyclone, said PAGASA forecaster Benison Estareja.
He added that the LPA would continue to move westward, and will be named Betty once it develops into a tropical cyclone.  
Warm and humid weather due to easterlies will continue to prevail over Metro Manila and the rest of the country.
Isolated rain showers caused by localized thunderstorms are still likely.
Light to moderate winds and slight to moderate seas will continue to prevail across the country, PAGASA said. (PNA)

34,Christening of Navy's 2 new Israeli missile boats set May 8,By Priam Nepomuceno,,"(Photo courtesy of Philippine Navy)
MANILA – The Philippine Navy (PN) announced that it will be conducting a christening ceremony for the two newly delivered fast attack interdiction craft-missile (FAIC-Ms) on May 8.
In an advisory to reporters Thursday, Navy spokesperson Capt. Benjo Negranza said the event will be held at Naval Station Pascual Ledesma, Fort San Felipe, Cavite City at 9 a.m.
These FAIC-Ms will be christened BRP Gener Tinangag (PG-903) and BRP Domingo Deluana (PG-905).
The namesake of these ships were both Marine personnel who were awarded the Medal of Valor, the highest military decoration for courage, bravery and self sacrifice above and beyond the call of duty. Both men died on the battlefield.
Aside from the christening rites, the PN will also hold a blessing ceremony for its Naval Shipbuilding Center which is also located at the same facility.
The guest-of-honor and speaker for these events will be Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri. These two ships were delivered to the Philippines last April 11.
""Said FAIC-Ms, which are part of the nine platforms contracted with Israel Shipyards, arrived from Israel on board the general cargo ship M/V Mick. They were unloaded with the assistance of BRP Mamanwa (LC-294) and proceeded to the naval shipyard in Cavite for a series of tests and crew training,"" Negranza earlier said.
These FAIC-Ms will soon join the Acero-class patrol gunboats along with frontrunners BRP Nestor Acero (PG-901) and BRP Lolinato To-ong (PG-902) which were commissioned last November.
""They are a welcome addition to the Navy's capability to secure vital choke points, key sea lines of communication, and littoral areas of the country,"" Negranza said. Five more are expected to be delivered within the next two years.
The 32-meter long FAIC-Ms are high-speed vessels equipped with quick intercept ability, remote stabilized weapons, and short-range missiles that are capable of delivering precision strikes against larger hostiles and high-value targets on land and sea.
Four of the FAIC-Ms will be armed with non-line-of-sight (NLOS) missiles with pinpoint accuracy and a range of 25 kilometers while the other five will be armed with Typhoon-mounted 30mm main cannons and .50 caliber heavy machine guns.
The acquisition of these FAIC-Ms is among the 2019 projects approved by former President Rodrigo Duterte under the Horizon 2 List of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Modernization Program.
The notice of award for the FAIC-M project, worth around PHP10 billion, was issued on Jan. 5, 2021. These are expected to replace PN’s medium-sized patrol craft.
Once deliveries of the FAIC-Ms are completed, these vessels can interdict surface threats and launch NLOS missiles safely using the surrounding littoral areas as maneuver space and cover.
Earlier, PN chief Vice Adm. Toribio Adaci Jr. said the Navy is planning to acquire at least 15 more Israel-made Shaldag Mark V missile boats, which are the basis of its Acero-class patrol gunboats.
He said the additional Acero-class gunboats would help them to meet their requirements in ""patrolling the seas of the country"".
Adaci also said the FAIC-Ms will be assigned to the Littoral Combat Force. (PNA)
