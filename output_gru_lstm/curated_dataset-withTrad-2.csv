PCG: Maritime patrol in WPS ‘non-provocative’ after near-collision,8.0,8.0,8.0,11.0,7.0
" The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said on Saturday that its maritime patrol in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) was “non-provocative” after a near-collision between a Chinese coast guard ship and a Philippine patrol vessel.   The PCG made the remark after China said the near-crash in the South China Sea between a Chinese coast guard ship and a Philippine patrol vessel carrying journalists was caused by the latter's ""premeditated and provocative action.”   “The routine, seven-day maritime patrol carried out by the PCG in the WPS from April 18–24 was non-provocative and did not undermine the interests of other states,” Commodore Jay Tarriela, PCG spokesperson for the WPS, said in a tweet.   Tarriela said the PCG has no obligation to request permission from other nations while patrolling the waters near Ayungin Shoal, adding that this area is within the country’s exclusive economic zone in accordance with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).   “Throughout their maritime patrol operations, PCG captains consistently follow the 1972 Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs),” he said.",8.0,11.0,14.0,14.0,5.0

" The near-miss off the Spratly Islands on Sunday was the latest in a steady string of incidents between China and the Philippines in the contested waterway.   The incident happened after Philippine coast guard boats approached Second Thomas Shoal (Ayungin Shoal), known in China as Ren'ai Jiao. As one boat neared the shoal, a Chinese Coast Guard vessel more than twice its size sailed into its path.   AFP journalists watched the incident from another Philippine coast guard boat, which was less than a kilometer away.   The Philippine captain said the Chinese ship came within 45 meters (50 yards) of his boat, and only his quick actions avoided the steel-hulled vessels crashing into each other.   The Department of Foreign Affairs also called on China to respect the legal rights of the country to conduct maritime patrols in the WPS.   Meanwhile, the PCG has reported that more than 100 Chinese vessels were spotted during the maritime patrols in the WPS.   President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has said that the Philippines will not give up an inch of its territory.    In July 2016, the UN Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, based on a case filed by the Philippines, junked China's nine-dash line claim covering nearly the entire South China Sea.

 The Sandiganbayan has affirmed its earlier decision junking the bid of former Budget Undersecretary Mario Relampagos to dismiss multiple graft and malversation charges against him in connection with the pork barrel scam.,5.0,5.0,5.0,,
" In an eight-page resolution dated March 10, the anti-graft court's Seventh Division sustained its February 16 ruling denying Relampagos’ demurrer to evidence in three graft and three malversation charges by noting that the latter remains a fugitive and is therefore not entitled to such judicial relief.",5.0,5.0,5.0,,
 A demurrer to evidence is a pleading seeking dismissal of charges due to weak prosecution evidence without presenting counter-evidence.,5.0,5.0,5.0,,
" “First, fugitives from justice placed themselves beyond the pale and protection of the law, so unless they  surrender, they lose their standing in court and waive their right to seek judicial relief,” the Sandiganbayan said.",5.0,7.0,5.0,,
" Relampagos, who is accused of conspiring with 12 other government officials and private citizens including businesswoman Janet Napoles in profiting off P7 million of public funds under the discretion of then Oriental Mindoro Representative Rodolfo Valencia, has not returned to the Philippines since he left for the United States in December 2017.",7.0,7.0,7.0,,
 Relampagos argued that a fugitive from justice may not be denied the right to a demurrer by citing the Harvard International Law Journal article by Elizabeth Herath titled “Trials in Absentia: Jurisprudence and Commentary on the Judgment in Chief Prosecutor v. Abul Kalam Azad in the Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal.”,5.0,5.0,5.0,,
" The Sandiganbayan, however, ruled that such argument does not hold weight because the cited article only pertains to the necessity of an accused’s legal representation in a trial in absentia.",5.0,5.0,5.0,,
" “The court finds no relation between the accused’s theory and his supposed legal basis  therefore. The matter of accused Relampagos’s legal representation during trial in absentia is currently not in issue,” it said.",5.0,5.0,5.0,,
 The anti-graft court said that Relampagos continues to be represented by his counsel even if the former Budget official reneged on his bail.,5.0,5.0,5.0,,
" Still, Relampagos insisted that denying his demurrer to evidence violates his constitutional right to be presumed innocent and speedy disposition of the case, an argument also shut down by the anti-graft court.",5.0,5.0,5.0,,
" “Denying the demurrer to evidence violates neither an  accused’s right to be presumed innocent nor his right to a speedy disposition of his case. If there is anyone whose action impacts on his right to be presumed innocent, it is accused Relampagos himself when he jumped bail,"" the Sandiganbayan said.",4.0,4.0,4.0,,
" “It is well established in this jurisdiction that flight is the evasion of the course of  justice by voluntarily withdrawing oneself in order to avoid arrest, detention  or the institution or continuance of criminal proceedings. It is considered an indication of guilt. In the instant case, denying accused Relampagos’s demurrer on the ground that he is a fugitive from justice and stating that judgment will be rendered after conclusion of the trial in absentia are in accordance with law and prevailing jurisprudence, as discussed in the assailed Resolution,” the anti-graft court added.",5.0,5.0,5.0,,
 The Sandiganbayan also said Relampagos cannot argue that the Seventh Division handling the case should grant his demurrer to evidence just because the Fourth Division granted his demurrer to evidence and subsequently cleared him in the 11 counts of graft charges filed against him involving around P107 million of former Masbate lawmaker Rizalina Seachon Lanete’s PDAF.,5.0,5.0,5.0,,
 The anti-graft court said that the principle of stare decisis involved by Relampagos is not applicable in this case because stare decisis requires courts to follow a rule already established by a final decision of the Supreme Court.,5.0,5.0,5.0,,
" “We find no merit in accused Relampagos’s reasoning that  this court should grant his demurrer notwithstanding that he is currently a  fugitive from justice, just because another Division of the Sandiganbayan did so.

"Disinformation, red-tagging of opposition lawmakers in PH ‘increased alarmingly’ ahead of 2022 elections — APHR",13.0,13.0,13.0,,
" Disinformation and the red-tagging of Filipino opposition lawmakers “increased alarmingly” ahead of the May 2022 polls, according to the ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR).   According to the APHR report, former Vice President Leni Robredo—main rival to now-President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. in the 2022 presidential election—was the “prime target of intensified disinformation and red-tagging in social media leading up to election day.”",12.0,13.0,13.0,,
" The APHR is a regional network of current and former parliamentarians with the aim of advancing human rights and democracy in Southeast Asia.   The APHR said Robredo was repeatedly “red-tagged” by government officials, including Lorraine Badoy, the former spokesperson for the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC).   Citing the Philippine courts, the APHR defined red-tagging as “the act of labeling, branding, naming, and accusing individuals and organizations of being left-leaning,  or terrorists [used as] a strategy… by state agents….against those perceived to be ‘threats’ or ‘enemies’ of the state.”   The report said that elected representatives, members, and supporters of the Makabayan bloc, a coalition of progressive left-wing party lists in the House of Representatives, were also red-tagged by the government as a legal front for the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).   In 2017, the government classified the CPP and the New People’s Army (NPA) as “terrorist organizations,” according to the report.",13.0,13.0,14.0,,
" “Despite the fact that the Makabayan bloc repeatedly rejected the government’s accusations, such red-tagging statements were posted on social media, especially Facebook pages of government agencies and public officials,” the APHR said.",12.0,13.0,13.0,,
" “They were shared widely by netizens, resulting in threats, violence, and sometimes deaths of members and supporters of the Makabayan bloc,” it added.",12.0,12.0,12.0,,
" In response to this, Badoy claimed that APHR may be “the latest victim of deception” of the CPP-NPA-NDF due to its “alliance building” with the Makabayan bloc.",13.0,13.0,13.0,,
" “Because the unequivocal truth is the Makabayan Bloc are all urban operatives of the CPP-NPA-NDF who are in Congress not to represent the interests of the Filipino people but the interest of the CPP-NPA-NDF which is one thing and one thing alone: the violent overthrow of government to make of us  state,” she said in a statement.",13.0,13.0,8.0,,
" “This is not ‘disinformation’ but information of the highest accuracy that no less than President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, then President of the Republic of the Philippines, declared it and asked our countrymen not to vote for these urban operatives of this terrorist organization.”",8.0,13.0,8.0,,
" Badoy also said that there is no such thing as “red-tagging,” citing the Supreme Court, that “there is no danger to life, liberty and security when one is identified as a member of the CPP-NPA-NDF.” ",5.0,5.0,5.0,,
" This interpretation by Badoy of a Supreme Court ruling has been disputed by the Commission on Human Rights.    The APHR also said that a number of attacks were recorded in 2022 against Senator Risa Hontiveros and House Deputy Minority Leader and ACT Teachers party-list Representative France Castro.   It also highlighted a “disturbing trend that emerged: misogynist harassment and attacks” against women lawmakers and candidates, saying that the “viciousness of misogynistic attacks intensified” during the administration of former President Rodrigo Duterte.   Meanwhile, the APHR said the landslide victory of Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte in the elections was “due in great part to a successful campaign of disinformation and red-tagging against opposition parties and political dissenters, including lawmakers.”",12.0,13.0,13.0,,
" “It is also concerning that online misogynist attacks seem to have taken root and have been strategically deployed to target and undermine the credibility of women lawmakers and candidates who have been known to express dissent and hold those in power accountable,” it said.   “The new administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. may continue such a campaign to silence criticism and consolidate power and deploy the same tactics in future elections.
