0,"Elections 2025: Stamping pens, new machine type, other changes Comelec seeks to introduce",Dwight de Leon,2023-05-04,"MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Elections (Comelec) has made public its proposed blueprint for the 2025 automated elections. Even without a ballpark figure yet from the poll body, the unprecedented changes put forward would surely require substantial funding from Congress. 
“Our policy direction is FASTrAC, [which stands for] Fully Automated System with Transparency, Audit, and Count,” Comelec Chairman George Garcia said on Thursday, May 4. 
From the type of machine that the Comelec wants, to transmission changes, here is a rundown of the ambitious automation reform agenda of the poll body – which it fondly calls a “wish list” – for the fast-approaching midterm polls.
The Comelec under Garcia’s leadership has been insistent on retiring the more than 97,000 vote-counting machines (VCMs) that the Philippines has relied on since 2016.
Over 1,000 of these machines malfunctioned in 2022, providing for an inconvenient voting experience for tens of thousands of Filipinos on election day. 
For 2025, the Comelec is looking for a manufacturer that would be willing to provide new equipment, which would no longer be called VCMs but automated counting machines (ACMs).
Existing VCMs in the Philippines are optical mark readers (OMRs), wherein voters use a paper ballot counted by machines. 
The Comelec wants the ACM to still be an OMR, but with direct recording electronic (DRE) capabilities. In a DRE setup, voters use a touch screen or touch pad.
For 2025, the Comelec wants the DRE touchscreen voting option available for persons with disabilities and for illiterate voters. A limited rollout of the feature could also be utilized by Filipinos taking part in local absentee voting (LAV) or overseas voting. 
The ACM would still print a voter receipt, which a person could check to determine whether their ballot was read accurately by the machine. But, in addition to that, the machine would scan the ballot and display its image one by one on screen after the transmission of election results. 
The poll body said this gives the electoral board, watchers, voters, and the public a chance to “visually inspect and manually verify the votes cast by viewing the ballot images (front and back) displayed on screen.”
The Comelec said this would add a layer of transparency and address voters’ doubts on whether the machine really tallied their votes properly even though the voter receipt showed the machine read their ballots correctly.
The current VCM requires that the ballot be fed in a vertical, unfolded manner to avoid paper jams.
In comparison, the proposed ACM would have an auto-align function, which means the machine would accept the ballot even if it was inserted in a skewed position.
The Comelec would like to do away with the usual markers, and instead introduce stamping pens. 
The reason: the shading threshold brouhaha that was a key contention by the camp of now-president Ferdinand Marcos Jr. during the recount of votes for the 2016 vice presidential election, which he lost to Leni Robredo. 
Garcia, who lawyered for Marcos during that messy electoral protest, said the use of stamping pens would avoid shading threshold issues. (RELATED: Comelec sets 25% ballot shading threshold for 2019 polls)
For the 2025 elections, the Comelec wants the machines to transmit results to multiple servers simultaneously – consolidated canvassing system, central server, majority and minority party servers, media server, and citizens’ arm server. 
“The machine should not pass through a transparency server when transmitting results. Instead, it would transmit to all from the machine. It would be the best feature of this machine,” Garcia said. 
The Comelec plans to conduct a market survey the soonest possible time, but the poll body believes the technology already exists, and it’s up to interested suppliers to come up with their best offer. 
“We are confident that we would be able to acquire ACMs for the 2025 elections. Why? These technologies are available in the market in one form or another,” Comelec spokesman Rex Laudiangco said. 
If all goes according to plan, the commission would kick off procurement by July, and award the contract to the winning bidder by January 2024. 
If there are hiccups along the way, such as the lack of interested bidders, the Comelec said it could easily adjust its terms of reference.
But what’s the worst case scenario?
“The worst case scenario is if we are not given the budget,” Garcia said. “In that case, we would use again the 97,000 VCMs we have declared unusable.”
The poll body added it would get back to the media on the question of how much the new system would cost, but Garcia said in May 2022 that replacing the VCMs with new ones would cost at least P6.7 billion. – Rappler.com

1,US issues guidelines on defending Philippines from South China Sea attack,Reuters,2023-05-04,"MANILA, Philippines – The United States has laid out in clear terms the extent of its defense treaty commitments to the Philippines, issuing new guidelines that refer specifically to attacks in the South China Sea, including on its coast guard.
The six-page “bilateral defense guidelines” agreed in Washington on Wednesday, May 3, follow a renewed push under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr to update the Mutual Defense Treaty with the former colonial ruler, at a time of increased tension and maritime confrontation with China.
The guidelines were a first since the treaty was signed in 1951 and follow scores of Philippine diplomatic protests in the past year over what it calls China’s “aggressive” actions and threats against its coast guard.
The guidelines said the bilateral treaty commitments would be invoked if either is attacked specifically in the South China Sea and also if coast guard vessels were the target.
It was also updated to include references to modern forms of warfare, including “grey zone tactics,” which China is accused of using to assert its claims to sovereignty. The guidelines did not mention China specifically.
“Recognizing that threats may arise in several domains – including land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace – and take the form of asymmetric, hybrid, and irregular warfare and grey-zone tactics, the guidelines chart a way forward to build interoperability in both conventional and non-conventional domains,” according to the Pentagon.
The South China Sea, a waterway vital to global trade, has become a major flashpoint in the increasingly testy relationship between China and the United States.
The guidelines send a “warning” to China against targeting the Philippine coast guard said Rommel Ong, former vice commander of the Philippine navy and a professor at the Ateneo School of Government.
Julio Amador, head of the Foundation for the National Interest, a Manila-based think-tank focusing on strategic and security issues, said of the security guidelines “It’s clear that it will give China some pause.”
China’s foreign ministry on Thursday said it opposed the use of bilateral defense treaties to interfere in the South China Sea, which “should not be a hunting ground for external forces”.
The guidelines were released during visit to Washington this week by Marcos, which included talks with counterpart Joe Biden.
Marcos also met Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who told him “we will always have your back, in the South China Sea or elsewhere in the region.”
Ties with the United States have deepened under Marcos, who in February granted its military access to more of his country’s bases, prompting accusations from China that the deal was “stoking the fire” of regional tension. – Rappler.com

2,"Follow audience on platforms like TikTok, journalists urge colleagues",James Patrick Cruz,2023-05-04,"MANILA, Philippines – Media should follow their audience on popular platforms like TikTok, journalists urged their colleagues on World Press Freedom Day.
In a forum at the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Mass Communication Auditorium on Wednesday, May 3, a panel of journalists said it is crucial to produce compelling content on social media platforms, as news consumers change their behavior.
“News must follow the audience. News must go where the people are. News must create the different ways of keeping it more interesting because it is relevant,” said Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility (CMFR) executive director Melinda Quintos de Jesus. 
“You have to touch base with your audience. You have to know about them. You have to connect with them. You have to make them part of the news and draw them in just as they were seduced by social media providers,” she added.
ABS-CBN News chief of reporters Jeff Canoy shared that he was initially reluctant about using social media in news reporting because it was unconventional. He, however, recognized the power of the platform to reach a wider audience. 
“Like many other journalists of my generation, it’s (social media) not for me. I grew up with newspapers, with TV and radio. So, I will say it’s not really for me and then I am now on TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook,” Canoy said. 
“Now that I’m trying to use this landscape, I sort of regret saying three years ago that that this is not for me. Because it’s up to us to safeguard social media against fake news, misinformation, disinformation, but the journalists weren’t there. That’s what is sad – we sort of allow this to fester,” he added. 
Based on a study by NewsGuard, a US-based site helmed by journalists that track online misinformation, found about 20% of search results delivered by TikTok contain misinformation. 
Freelance journalist and former Rappler reporter Rambo Talabong, for his part, emphasized the value of language to engage the audience. 
“Napakahalaga ng wika kasi kung mayroon kayong parehong pananalita, sinasabi bahagi kayo ng parehong village, parehong lugar. Alam ‘nyo parang, ‘Ah galing siya sa parehong konteksto sa akin,'” he said. 
(Language is very important because if you speak the same language, you are considered part of the same village, the same place. You know, it’s like, ‘Oh, he comes from the same context as me.’)
While Talabong recognized the relevance of using TikTok and producing engaging content to inform the public, he said it is not enough as he highlighted the attacks against the press. 
“Rights are not guaranteed. Sabihin man natin na may karapatan tayo, karapat-dapat na mayroon tayo na karapatan na pumunta at magreport nang malaya pero wala tayo nito,” Talabong said. 
(Rights are not guaranteed. We may argue that we have rights, we should have the right to go and report freely but we do not have these rights.)
During the forum organized by the UP College of Mass Communication and Freedom for Media, Freedom for All Network, De Jesus presented a report on the attacks against media workers since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. assumed power last year. 
Based on the compiled report of CMFR and the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, there were 75 attacks and threats against media workers from June 30, 2022, to April 30, 2023.
Within this short period, two journalists were killed: radio broadcaster Rey Blanco who was stabbed to death in Negros Oriental, and Percival Mabasa, better known as Percy Lapid, who was shot dead in Las Piñas City.  
Among the alleged perpetrators of the attacks against media workers, 41 were state agents – 23 from the national government, 12 from the police, and six from the local government. 
“How dangerous can the world become for people doing this job? How much more killings? How much more danger and peril?” De Jesus asked. – Rappler.com

3,"As COVID-19 cases rise, BuCor suspends visitation in New Bilibid Prison",Jairo Bolledo,2023-05-04,"MANILA, Philippines – In light of the rising COVID-19 cases, Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) Director General Gregorio Catapang Jr. suspended the visitation in the New Bilibid Prison in Muntinlupa City and in the Correctional Institution for Women (CIW) in Mandaluyong City. 
The BuCor made the announcement on Wednesday night, May 3, adding that the visitation will remain suspended until further notice. According to the data provided by Dr. Ma. Cecilia Villanueva, BuCor health services director, 32 individuals out of 407 tested on May 2 yielded positive results. 
In tests conducted on Wednesday, 16 out of 174 also tested positive for COVID-19. 
In total, 48 have tested positive for the virus. However, the BuCor has yet to clarify if these individuals are persons deprived of liberty (PDL) or BuCor personnel or officials. 
The corrections bureau added that most of the cases came from Bilibid’s maximum compound, which houses 18,000 PDLs. The BuCor added the individuals are either asymptomatic or mild cases, and currently in isolation ward in the national penitentiary. 
“Two years na tayong walang kaso ng COVID-19, most likely nahawa and ating PDLs sa dumalaw sa kanya (We had no COVID-19 case in the last two years so most likely, our PDL was infected by his/ her visitor),” Villanueva said in a statement. 
The statement said the BuCor will also resume contact tracing inside the maximum security compound. Villanueva, as quoted by BuCor’s statement, said 99% of the PDLs are fully vaccinated, while 94% already received their first booster shot. 
For the PDLs’ relatives who might have concerns, the BuCor advised them to contact Bilibid’s Inmate Visitation Service Unit at 84780808 local 161, and 85321736 for the CIW. 
As of April 27, Octa Research said the seven-day positivity rate in Metro Manila had increased from 8.1% to 12.3%. 
At the height of the pandemic in 2020, an average of 60 PDLs died in Bilibid per month. With a population of over 28,000, the national penitentiary suffers from a congestion rate of 335%, as of 2020. – Rappler.com

5,House leader flags government agencies’ slow fund disbursement for 2023,Dwight de Leon,2023-05-03,"MANILA, Philippines – House ways and means panel chairman Joey Salceda began his committee hearing on Wednesday, May 3, with a concern that was not originally on the day’s agenda: the slow disbursement of government funds. 
Salceda called out government agencies for not expediting the release of the funds, and for not spending the cash fast enough.
He said this is unacceptable when tax collection agencies – the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) and the Bureau of Customs (BOC) – exceeded expectations on their revenue performance. 
“Despite growth in collection, we are actually implementing contractionary fiscal policy, with disbursements down 1.05%,” he said. “There’s no reason for disbursements to be down 1.05%. That is why this ways and means committee is working double time to find funds that the government can spend.”
“Collections made by the BIR and BOC are useless if the Department of Finance (DOF), Bureau of Treasury (BOT), and the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) would not release it. There are still many pending special allotment release orders (SARO),” Salceda added. 
He asserted that the DBM should take advantage of the clearance it got from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to release allotment orders.
“Crucial agencies for economic and social services, such as DPWH, DOLE, and DBM, must be more aggressive in implementing programs to expand productivity. Otherwise, growth will come solely from the private sector,” Salceda said. 
“As one of my mentors, former secretary Winnie Monsod, once told me – when we miss growth targets, we kill people, the sick die, and families go hungry,” he added. 
The Marcos government has a whopping budget of P5.2 trillion for 2023, the biggest for the Philippine government to date.
The administration has said the funds would be used for its recovery plan “as the country emerges from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.” – Rappler.com

6,WATCH: Rapplers share their challenges in pursuit of press freedom,Vixey Lema,2023-05-03,"MANILA, Philippines – What does it take to be a truth-teller in the Philippines?

Rappler multimedia reporter Jairo Bolledo shared his experience of receiving threats for reporting the truth. 
He said that such acts of intimidation and aggression towards journalists simply show that the Philippines remains unsafe for truth-tellers. “Nakakalungkot [na] just because you report and sinasabi mo ‘yung totoo ay nakakareceive ka ng ganitong pagbabanta sa buhay mo, pagbabanta para saktan ka,” he added.
(It’s sad that reporting the truth can put one’s life and safety at risk.) 
He shared the belief of many others that the Philippines has a long way to go to achieve a better, safer media landscape. 
According to the data and monitoring of the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP), 197 journalists had been killed since 1986.  This number includes the two recent killings under the new Marcos administration: Rey Blanco and Percival “Percy Lapid” Mabasa. 
The Philippines also slipped down in the press freedom index ranking of Reporters Without Borders for 2022.

Amid the harassment, she said that journalists in the country will continue to shed light on the “least reported” issues, especially in the provinces. 
Rappler head of investigation and research Chay Hofileña emphasized the role of the government in upholding a safe environment for the media. 
She said that maligning the reliability and function of media in society serves as a “major stumbling block” and that it “makes the job a lot more difficult.” (READ: Gov’t platforms being used to attack, red-tag media)

7,Sandiganbayan affirms graft case vs ex-QC mayor Herbert Bautista,Rappler.com,2023-05-02,"MANILA, Philippines – The Sandiganbayan, the country’s anti-graft court, affirmed the charge against former Quezon City mayor Herbert “Bistek” Bautista. 
In a 15-page resolution, the court denied Bautista’s motion seeking the outright dismissal of graft case against Bautista for the alleged anomalous contract he signed three days before he stepped down as mayor in 2019. The Sandiganbayan’s Seventh Division, in blocking the former mayor’s move, denied Bautista’s Urgent Omnibus Motion asking to dismiss the case with prejudice. 
The ruling was penned by Associate Justice Ma. Theresa Dolores Gomez-Estoesta, with the concurrence of Associate Justices Zaldy Trespeses and Georgina Hidalgo. 
The anti-graft court said the case filed by the Office of the Ombudsman dated March 15, 2023 sufficiently states the allegations to sustain the indictment. In addition, the Sandiganbayan also set aside Bautista’s contention that his constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases has been violated.
“The length of time taken by the Ombudsman to complete its preliminary investigation and to file the Information, by itself, cannot be deemed as vexatious, capricious, or oppressive. Absent any vexatious, capricious or oppressive delays…It is unwarranted to conclude that the accused’s constitutional right to speedy disposition of cases was infringed,” the Sandiganbayan declared. 
Bautista’s arguments also concern matters of evidence, which are not proper for a motion to quash, the court said. 
“(I)t is at once clear that the issues raised by the accused cannot be considered in evaluating the sufficiency of the Information because the same largely pertain to extrinsic matters or evidence aliunde. They not only highlight factual allegations that require evidence presentation but more so, relegate legal issues that require a conclusion from the court when trial is yet to begin,” the Sandiganbayan said. 
The case stemmed from the allegation that Bautista and former city administrator Aldrin Cuña allegedly favored private contractor Geodata Solutions Inc. The deal allegedly caused undue injury to Quezon City when Bautista and Cuña approved the P32.108 million contract for the “procurement of online occupational permitting and tracking system.”
According to the prosecutors, the project had no specific appropriation approved by the Sangguniang Panlungsod. The private contractor also failed to make a complete delivery of the project. 
In his arguments, Bautista argued that Geodata’s contract underwent a competitive public bidding undertaken by the Bids and Awards Committee. The former QC mayor also raised that none of the BAC members was named co-defendant in the case. 
Bautista also invoked good faith and said as mayor, he relied on his subordinates in dealing with the bidding documents. The former mayor also said the project was supported by QC’s Annual Procurement Plan and backed by certifications from the budget office, accounting department, and the treasurer’s office. 
The former QC mayor also said he derived no personal gain in the transaction and the project was strictly for QC residents’ benefits. 
Both Bautista and Cuña are facing a second graft case before the anti-graft court’s Third Division concerning P25.34 million solar power contract system with Cygnet Energy and Power Asia Inc. – Rappler.com

8,‘Welcome back’: Marcos-Biden meeting flexes ‘optimism’ in bilateral ties,Bea Cupin,2023-05-02,"WASHINGTON DC, USA – When US President Joe Biden welcomed President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to the White House on Monday, May 1, he might have triggered some feelings of nostalgia on the part of the Philippine leader as Biden recalled Marcos’ past visit there with his late father and namesake.
“Welcome back to the White House. We talked on the way over, it’s been a while since you’ve been here…. You’ve been here with President Reagan, with your father,” Biden said during short remarks at the Oval Office, ahead of their bilateral meeting – their second bilateral meeting in less than a year.
Outside the White House at Lafayette Square, protesters from progressive groups opposed to US presence in the Asia-Pacific chanted, “Marcos is not welcome here!” The chants followed him all the way to the Ritz Carlton, where Marcos met with supporters dressed in their finest Filipiniana wear. 
But the protests would matter little to the Biden administration, which had described Marcos’ visit as “extremely significant” and the “first kind of meeting at this level and intensity between the United States and the Philippines in decades.” 
For Manila’s oldest treaty ally, Marcos’ five-day official working visit to Washington is an even stronger indication that he is set to follow a path different from that of his foul-mouthed predecessor, who cussed at then-US president Barack Obama, called the US State Department “fools,” and threatened to scrap the Philippines-US Visiting Forces Agreement after the US canceled the visa of his then-police chief, Senator Bato dela Rosa, the architect of Duterte’s controversial drug war.
The lead-up to the White House visit has been eventful and rather quick. Not even a year into office and Marcos had already hosted three top US officials in Malacañang, and had sent his defense and foreign secretaries to a 2 + 2 meeting with their American counterparts. 
In less than a year, too, the Philippine government, under Marcos, agreed to open up four more military bases to US troops and equipment. Marcos also graced the biggest-ever iteration of Balikatan, the yearly joint Philippines-US military exercise. 
Describing the Indo-Pacific as having the “most complicated geopolitical situation in the world right now,” Marcos said it was “only natural” for Manila to look to the US “to strengthen and to redefine the relationship that we have and the roles that we play in the face of these rising tensions that we see now around the South China Sea and the Asia-Pacific and Indo-Pacific region.” 
Biden, as he and his predecessors had repeatedly done in the past, reaffirmed the US’ “ironclad alliance commitments to the Philippines,” including the promise to come to Manila’s defense in case of an attack “in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea.”
When Biden made a reference to Ronald Reagan and the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos, he was drawing from his personal political history.
The Washington Post, reporting on Marcos’ visit to the US, said that in the 1980s, then-senator Biden “was a vocal critic of the elder Marcos” and “suggested that President Ronald Reagan’s willingness to support the Philippine dictator was in part based on his desire to maintain US leases on military bases.”
Had the US president hopped on over to the Executive Residence located across Lafayette Square, he would have heard a Martial Law-era chant that had made a resurgence following Marcos’ election as president in 2022: “Marcos, Hitler, diktador, tuta (dictator, lapdog).” 
The older Marcos last visited the US in September 1982, for a state visit, a trip to New York, then a private visit. Marcos Sr. and the rest of the clan had a close but complicated relationship with the US. Americans supported the Marcos dictatorship until it could not, and later provided refuge for the exiled clan in Hawaii. 
The President and his mother Imelda, half of the conjugal dictatorship, have standing contempt orders against them in the US. But as chief executive, Marcos enjoys diplomatic immunity and has been assured by the Biden administration itself of safe passage and access to the US. 
“When we met in New York last year, you told me  that a strong alliance has to continue – I’m using your phrase — ‘to evolve as we face the challenges of this new century.’ And we are facing new challenges. And I can’t think of any better partner to have than you,” Biden told his White House guest. 
The partnership is not a perfect one – then and now. 
Protests at Lafayette Square echo qualms back home over Americans boots on Philippine soil. Local government units that host military bases under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) have also expressed concern of being dragged into US tensions with China, and over worries of abuse and even crime associated with US soldiers’ access to these bases. 
The Biden administration, seemingly in response to these concerns, promised to “support health, education, environmental protections, economic growth, and disaster preparedness” in areas close to EDCA sites. 
At exactly 2:46 pm, Marcos and First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos arrived at the White House South Portico where Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, flanked by both the Philippine and US flags, were waiting to welcome them. 
Select Philippine Cabinet officials, also wearing barong Tagalog, followed close behind in a much bigger shuttle, to attend the expanded meeting at the West Wing. 
After a brief walk down the corridor by the Rose Garden, Marcos and Biden sat down to speak before the media – a pool of Philippine and US reporters, photographers, and videographers.
“We have many things that – that are new that need to be assessed and, again, our role as partners in the world – in our worldview of what we are hoping for the future of peace, not only in the Asia-Pacific and Indo-Pacific region, but in the whole world. So, thank you once again for this opportunity, Mr. President,” said Marcos. 
“Thank you. And I’m optimistic things will get even better,” Biden replied. 
“Thank you, Sir,” Marcos told Biden. 
“Thank you,” Biden finally said. 
No questions were entertained, as White House aides ushered the media away from the Oval Office. 
In a press statement following the bilateral meeting, the White House said the two presidents set out an “ambitious agenda” that covers a range of issues, including a trade and investment mission to the Philippines, bilateral defense guidelines, support for the Philippine military, holding the Indo-Pacific Business Forum in Manila, opening an Open RAN Interoperability Lab, providing infrastructure support, creating a labor working group, giving education support,working on clean energy, and different development projects under United States Agency for International Development.  
Marcos is also set to meet with US business executives and lawmakers at Blair House, the US president’s Guest House. Biden is scheduled to meeting Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff – Harris had visited Malacañang in November 2022 while Emhoff led the US delegation to Marcos’ inauguration.

9,"Amid China pressure, US, Philippines recommit to security alliance",Reuters,2023-05-02,"WASHINGTON DC, USA – The US and the Philippines reaffirmed their decades-old security alliance on Monday (Tuesday in Manila) and US President Joe Biden told his counterpart President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. the US commitment to the defense of its ally was “ironclad,” including in the South China Sea where Manila is under pressure from China.
Marcos, on the first White House visit by a Philippines leader in 10 years, stressed the importance of the US as his country’s sole treaty ally in a region with “arguably the most complicated geopolitical situation in the world right now.”
The trip marks a dramatic turnaround in US-Philippine relations as both countries seek ways to push back against what they see as China’s increasingly aggressive actions near Taiwan and in the South China Sea.
US officials said the leaders agreed on new guidelines for stronger military cooperation, as well as stepped up economic cooperation.
“The United States remains ironclad in our commitment to the defense of the Philippines, including the South China Sea,” Biden told Marcos in the Oval Office.
A joint statement said this meant that any armed attack on Philippine armed forces, public vessels or aircraft in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea, would invoke US mutual defense commitments under 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty.
Washington sees the Philippines as key to any effort to counter an invasion of Taiwan by China, which claims the island as its own territory. Manila recently agreed to allow the US access to four more sites under an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, but the two sides have not said what US assets will be stationed at those sites.
The joint statement said the leaders “affirm the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of global security and prosperity.”
Under Rodrigo Duterte, Marcos’ predecessor, US relations soured as he turned the Philippines sharply away from its former colonial ruler and built closer ties with China.
Biden has invested in courting Marcos, who still faces a US court judgment connected with $2 billion of plundered wealth under his father’s rule.
US officials said the new guidelines focused on military coordination across land, sea, air, space and cyberspace, while the US administration would also transfer three C-130 aircraft and look to send additional patrol vessels to the Philippines.
“It is only natural for the Philippines to look to its sole treaty partner in the world to strengthen and to redefine the relationship that we have and the roles that we play in the face of those rising tensions that we see now around the South China, Asia Pacific and Indo-Pacific region,” Marcos said.
The summit is the centerpiece of a four-day US visit by Marcos that started on Sunday.
Marcos has sought warm relations with both the US and China, who are vying for influence in the Indo-Pacific.
Experts say Washington considers the Philippines a potential location for rockets, missiles and artillery systems to counter a Chinese amphibious assault on Taiwan. 
However, Marcos told reporters on his plane China had agreed to discuss fishing rights in the South China Sea and also that he would not allow the Philippines to become a “staging post” for military action.
The joint statement said Biden would send a Presidential Trade and Investment Mission to the Philippines to enhance investment in clean energy transition, the critical minerals sector, and food security.
The two countries would also co-host in Manila the 2024 Indo-Pacific Business Forum – the marquee US commercial event in the region – which would further establish the Philippines as a key hub for regional supply chains.
The statement also said the countries looked forward to establishing trilateral cooperation with Japan and Australia.
With many Filipinos frustrated by China’s actions in the South China Sea, including the harassing of Philippine ships and fishermen in parts that both countries claim, popular support has grown in the Philippines for a tougher stance toward Beijing.
Biden was the first official to reach out to Marcos after his election and has made strengthening economic and military ties in the Indo-Pacific region a cornerstone of his foreign policy.
Before the summit, US lawmakers sent a bipartisan letter to Biden calling on him to raise what they called the worsening human rights “crisis” in the Philippines.
They said there were well-documented violations under Duterte but recent reports showed “ongoing impunity.” They cited reports from the Karapatan Human Rights Alliance of 17 extrajudicial killings, 165 illegal arrests from July to December 2022, and a total of 825 political prisoners. – Rappler.com

11,Marcos in the White House: Manila back in Washington’s arms,Bea Cupin,2023-05-01,"WASHINGTON DC, USA – Manila’s pivot back to Washington reaches its climax on Monday, May 1, as a Filipino president steps inside the White House for the first time in over a decade.
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is set to meet US President Joe Biden at the White House on Monday (Tuesday, May 2, in Manila), a symbolic move in the face of China’s efforts to lure Southeast Asia away from America. 
By making this visit, Marcos follows in the footsteps of the late Benigno Aquino III, the last Filipino president to meet his American counterpart at the White House. Marcos’ trip to the US goes a notch higher, in fact, as Marcos is undertaking an official visit, as opposed to Aquino’s lower-level working trip in 2012.
Coupled with moves such as approving four new bases under EDCA, personally witnessing Balikatan, and summoning the Chinese ambassador to Malacañang, Marcos is taking a path closer to Aquino’s than Duterte’s when it comes to the US and China.
“My visit to the United States, and more especially my meeting with President Joe Biden, is essential to advancing our national interests and strengthening that very important alliance,” said Marcos in a speech at Villamor Airbase before boarding the presidential plane PR001. 
Just eight months before this, Marcos also declared in New York City that he could not “see the Philippines in the future without having the United States as a partner.” 
For a president who ran on a platform of continuity, this is a departure from his predecessor, Duterte, who vowed never to visit America as president, called Barack Obama a son of a whore, and declared in Beijing “my separation from the United States, both in military but economics also.”
This is the second time Marcos and Biden are meeting. The first time was in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2022.
If the first meeting in New York was about introductions and making connections, the second one is about making sense of those ties. 
Marcos said he wants to hear from Biden himself where the US stands given tensions in region. The Philippine president, who is joined in this trip by his defense officials, said he also wants the Philippine position of “peace” clear to its longtime ally.
Ambassador Teresita Daza, spokesperson of the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, said in an April 29 briefing that “discussions on security and defense are a given.” For this particular trip, she added, “there will be a heavy emphasis on the economic agenda.”
It is, however, impossible to leave China out of the equation. Marcos entered Malacañang just as competition between Washington and China in the Indo-Pacific heightens. 
The Philippines, among the US’s oldest treaty allies, is right in the middle of this competition, made more tense by China’s brazen acts in the West Philippine Sea, a portion of the South China Sea that’s part of the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.  
The Aquino administration made a successful push to set back China’s claim of practically the entire South China Sea. Beijing, however, has refused to acknowledge the ruling. 
Philippine-China relations then took a 180-degree turn during Duterte’s failed “pivot” to China. 
Several key officials of the Biden administration have visited Marcos in Malacañang, the most prominent of whom are US Vice President Kamala Harris, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The Philippines and the US’ foreign affairs and defense ministers also recently met for a 2 + 2 Ministerial Meeting. 
At the same time, Marcos has made it a point to keep China, its largest trading partner, close. He promised a “maturing” of Philippine-China relations during a state visit to Beijing in January 2023, then summoned Chinese Ambassador to Manila Huang Xilian months later, after a laser-pointing incident in the West Philippine Sea.
Months later, Marcos came to Huang’s defense after the Chinese envoy criticized the addition of four military bases under Manila and Washington’s Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) and advised the Philippines to stand against Taiwan independence if it “[cares] genuinely” about Filipino migrant workers in Taiwan. 
Marcos recently welcomed to Malacañang Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang even as the Philippine government, through the Philippine Coast Guard, has become more vocal about China’s harassment in the West Philippine Sea. 
In an interview en route to Joint Base Andrews for the US visit, Marcos called on China to fulfill an earlier obligation to a communications mechanism that would help avoid “miscalculations” in these waters.
There is a limit, too, to Marcos’ and the Philippines’ willingness to take sides in the Sino-American competition. “We work for peace. We’ll not encourage any provocative action by any country that involves [the Philippines]. We will not allow that to happen. We will not use – we will not allow the Philippines to be used as a staging post for any kind of military action,” said Marcos. 
The Philippines is among the US’s oldest treaty allies, which means both countries have vowed to come to each other’s defense in the event of an attack. Harris, during a visit in November 2022, affirmed the US’s commitment to defending the Philippines from an attack in the South China Sea. 
It also means that Manila is a key part of the US’ strategy in the Indo-Pacific. 
“For the United States, the Philippines is an indispensable ally due its strategic location, just south of Taiwan and abutting the South China Sea. Whether the United States has access to military facilities in the Philippines could potentially be the key variable in a military contingency in the Western Pacific,” said Brian Harding, senior expert for Southeast Asia and Pacific Islands at the United States Institute of Peace. 
Manila also stands to benefit from the military alliance, especially given China’s transgressions. “While the Philippines would prefer to be able to deter China unilaterally and is seeking to develop a more credible defense posture for itself, the reality is its greatest asset is the security guarantee under the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) with the United States and US commitment to abide by the treaty,” he said. 
Marcos has said that he wants the MDT to “evolve” according to changes in geopolitics: the situation in the South China Sea, Taiwan, and North Korea, among others. 
“The conditions under which the Mutual Defense Treaty was written, the original one, are completely different from the conditions we’re facing now. China, of course, has become very dominant in the region. The United States has become less so. But then the other player, i.e. like ASEAN member-states, all the Asian states have also changed their position in the world…. We will talk about all of these things. So that’s really one of the main purposes of the visit,” he told the media in an interview on board the presidential plane. 
There is certainly also personal history at play when you talk about the Marcos clan and the United States. 
Marcos’ father and namesake, the dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr., had a very close relationship with the Americans then. Despite rampant human rights abuses in the Philippines, Washington remained a very close friend and ally to the elder Marcos, until it could not. 
Even when the US finally withdrew support for Marcos Sr., it was the Americans who helped the Marcos clan – the current President included – flee Malacañang for what would eventually become exile in Hawaii. 
Thus it’s in the US, too, where Marcos and his family faced cases over their theft of Philippine funds and human right abuses. Marcos Jr. and his mother, the former first lady Imelda Marcos, have standing contempt judgements against them in the US. But as chief executive, Marcos enjoys and has been promised diplomatic immunity. 
Exile in Hawaii did not last that long, however. In 1992, not even a decade since they were ousted from Malacañang during the People Power Revolution, Marcos Jr. returned to the Philippines and ran for office as a matter of “survival” for his clan. 
The priority of the Marcoses, according to analysts, is to clean their family’s name on the world stage.
Fast-forward to May 2022, Biden was the first to congratulate Marcos when it was clear he would be the 17th president of the Republic. 
Biden, as the Washington Post pointed out ahead of his meeting with Marcos, had opposed the President’s father in the 1980s. 
Biden “suggested that President Ronald Reagan’s willingness to support the Philippine dictator was in part based on his desire to maintain US leases on military bases,” the Washington Post reported on Sunday, April 30. 
“If we are totally identified with a corrupt, discredited regime that does not have the support of its people, we may be able to hold on to our bases in the short term but we will so alienate the people that we will lose them in the long run,” Biden, then a senator, reportedly said. 
While the Marcos dictatorship is not expected to be discussed, the White House said in a statement that human rights would be on the agenda in the meeting with Marcos, consistent with the Biden administration’s strategy on the Indo-Pacific. Malacanang did not include human rights or press freedom in its agenda.
During their meeting, Marcos and Biden will also agree to new guidelines aimed at strengthening military cooperation, said US officials, underscoring a dramatic turnaround in US-Philippine relations over the past year. 
Biden will also reaffirm the countries’ 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, which calls for the United States to act in the event of an armed attack on the Philippine military, said the officials. – with reports from Reuters/Rappler.com
