Well, those wafers now come down and we are setting up a 300-mm Center of Excellence in Cavite, which is doing all of the wafer programs and associated with our products,” he addedAs of 2022, the company’s facility in the Philippines employs 5,252 Filipino workers, with a total of $394.39 million worth of exports for the same year.It has also been carrying out the ADI University Program in the Philippines that is comprised of different activities in providing engineering students with the opportunity to further develop the theory and application of analog circuit design.They are also eyeing to acquire the Philippine counterparts of Maxim -- Maxim Philippines Operating Corp., as a result of the global ADI’s $20.8 billion acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products Inc.ADVERTISEMENTMeanwhile, Maxeon, a global leader in solar technology and innovation, said it is looking into investing $900 million in solar energy in the Philippines, as it expands operations in the country particularly for its R&D.Bill Mulligan, the firm’s chief-executive-officer who operates the SunPower brand in all global markets, including the Maxeon brand in the United States, Canada and Japan, said the investment is seen to provide more than 3,000 jobs in the next few years.The company currently has an R&D facility in Cavite that provides job to at least 2,000 Filipino workers.“The Philippines has been incredibly important... it’s actually a strategic part of our company. And I want to thank you and I want to thank all of the government agencies for all of the help and the support for the 40 plus years that we’ve been in the country,” Mulligan said.ADVERTISEMENTMaxeon has been operating in the Philippines since 2003 under the name of Sunpower Philippines Manufacturing Ltd and opened its first factory at the Laguna Technopark in Biñan City in 2004.BPO company Atento also assured Marcos of its commitment to set up its first Philippine-based call center at the Iloilo Business Park in Mandurriao, Iloilo.The investment costs $800 million and is seen to provide around 1,500 jobs.In March, Optum met with the Board of Investments (BOI) to discuss details of its planned new project in Davao and queries on importation of equipment.ADVERTISEMENTSince 2011, UnitedHealth Group Optum has invested P5.1 billion in capital expenditure in operating four sites in Taguig, Muntinlupa, Quezon City, and Cebu City.UHG’s Optum business in the country provides a broad range of healthcare information management services, including clinical, revenue cycle management, pharmacy services and benefit management, payment integrity, quality and risk adjustment, technology, and other services delivered across voice, non-voice and blended processes.ADVERTISEMENTModerna, a pharmaceutical and biotechnology company that pioneered the production of Covid-19 vaccines, also said that it will establish a “Shared Service Facility for Pharmacovigilance” in the Philippines to serve the entire Asia Pacific Region.The project will also be the first investment by Moderna in the Philippines and its first in Asia.

4,Marcos: PH-US partnerships cover all sectors,Third Anne Peralta-Malonzo,"May 03, 2023","PRESIDENT Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. said all sectors were covered by the partnership between the Philippines and the United States (US).In a meeting with the United States-Philippines Society (USPS) in Washington, Marcos said he was also pleased with the significant progress that both countries have made towards strengthening and further enhancing their security alliance.“Yes, now, prominent are the security defense issues, but if you look at what do we do in partnership, in coordination with the United States and there’s no part of — there’s no sector that isn’t touched by that partnership,” he said.“The strengthening and deepening of relations between the US and Philippines [have] certainly [been] a big step forward with all the developments that have been happening. It has been terribly useful for us to talk about redefining our mutual defense treaty and this I think has given us the opportunity to lay out, as you say, that roadmap for the economy and for another big issue in the Philippines – climate change and all the other big issues,” he added.Also known as The Society, the USPS is a non-profit, bi-national organization of prominent civic and business leaders of the US and the Philippines. It was co-chaired by former US Ambassador John D. Negropotente alongside Filipino business tycoon Manny Pangilinan.ADVERTISEMENTThe organization was formed in May 2012 with the goal of enhancing and raising awareness of the profile of the Philippines in the US in the areas of security, trade, investments, tourism, the environment, history, education and culture.During the meeting, IBM head of International Trade Policy Government and Regulatory Affairs Michael DiPaula Coyle said they are “very, very bullish” on the Philippine economy and are looking forward to working with the government to invest in digitalization.“We’re also very heavily invested in helping grow your talent pool through skills development programs. We’ve had a number of partnerships with the US government with your government to improve skills development particularly in areas like... AI (artificial intelligence) and cybersecurity where I think the Philippines has an enormous opportunity to position yourselves as a very competitive economy particularly in the IT services sector,” he said.On Monday evening (Manila Time), Marcos said the trade relations and partnership between the Philippines and the US must be “continually revisited” so that both parties would mutually benefit from these initiatives.“I was telling the President (Joe Biden) it’s very hard to categorize the partnership between the Philippines and US as one thing. It’s not just in the area of defense. Maybe now there’s a prominent one that we hear about but in terms of trade, in terms of education, in terms of culture, in terms of people-to-people as it has come to be known, all of these things have been going on for a hundred years,” Marcos said in his speech during the dinner hosted by the Philippine Embassy at the Blair House.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT“But it still needs to be continually revisited so as we can make the most of our friendship and our partnership. And so that is the world as I see it today and the reasons that will come. That is why I am very grateful for the invitation of President Biden to come to Washington, D.C. and gain the opportunity to meet the leaders of the government,” he added.Marcos and Biden have affirmed a series of partnerships that is aimed at strengthening the cooperation between the two ally countries on a range of critical issues, including security cooperation, humanitarian aid, fight against looming climate change, food efficiency and security, environmental protection, energy, agriculture, rule of law, human rights and trade and investment.(SunStar Philippines)"

7,MIAA general manager suspended over grave abuse of authority,Third Anne Peralta-Malonzo,"May 03, 2023","THE Office of the Ombudsman has ordered the preventive suspension of Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) General Manager Cesar Chiong over alleged grave abuse of authority.MIAA Senior Assistant General Manager Bryan Co was assigned as officer-in-charge.Also under preventive suspension on the orders of the Ombudsman was MIAA Acting Assistant General Manager Irene Montalbo.The Ombudsman said that Chiong seemed to have abused his authority when he designated Montalbo as assistant general manager for finance and administration despite her unsatisfactory rating, and when he reassigned about 285 MIAA employees without informing them the reason.“Based on the evidence on record, it appears that the evidence of guilt of the respondents is strong and the charge against them involves grave misconduct which may warrant their removal from the service,"" the Ombudsman said.ADVERTISEMENT“Considering further that respondents' continued stay in the office may influence potential witnesses and may prejudice the case filed against them due to their continued access to documentary evidence relative thereto, this Office exercises its power to place respondents under preventive suspension,” he added.ADVERTISEMENTChiong expressed confidence, though, that he will be cleared from the allegations.The two officials’ suspension came following another mess at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3 due to power outage that affected dozens of flights and thousands of passengers.

8,"PH, US security cooperation to ‘keep going’ amid WPS tensions",Third Anne Peralta-Malonzo,"May 03, 2023","AMID tensions in the Asia-Pacific region that include the continuous aggressiveness of China in the South China Sea (West Philippine Sea), President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. said the security cooperation between the Philippines and its longstanding ally, the United States, will “just keep going.”In a chance interview during his meeting with US Vice President Kamala Harris in Washington, Marcos said he is “concerned as you could possibly be” over China’s provocative action in the WPS.“It is one of the major issues that we have to face back home,” he said.“Well, cooperation with the United States certainly is just something that we are building upon that has been going on for many, many, many decades. And we just keep going,” the President added.In the meeting, Harris stressed the need for Manila and Washington to continue to work together to address the maritime issues in the West Philippine Sea through their respective Coast Guards.ADVERTISEMENTHarris visited the Philippines in November 2022, including Puerto Princesa in Palawan, one of the provinces closest to the disputed WPS, where she had the opportunity to chat with some of the local fishermen.In a joint statement on Monday, both President Marcos and US President Joseph Biden welcomed the identification of new sites under the US-Philippines Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (Edca), which is seen to strengthen Philippine security and support the modernization goals of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.Marcos and Biden underscored their “unwavering commitment” to freedom of navigation and overflight in the WPS, as well as the importance of respecting the sovereign rights of states within their exclusive economic zones, consistent with international law.Earlier, the Chinese Embassy in Manila said the US is only using the Philippines for its “selfish geopolitical interests” when it sought for the additional Edca sites in the country as it upholds the Mutual Defense Treaty.It said that while the US claims that such cooperation is intended to help the disaster relief efforts of the Philippines and to drive local economy, “it is plain and simple that those moves are part of its efforts to encircle and contain China through its military alliance.”ADVERTISEMENTIt also said that China and the Philippines should maintain “good-neighborliness” in order to attain mutual benefit instead of “getting distracted by forces who are fanning the flame and driving a wedge between us, even less inviting a bully into our community.”The Philippine government has filed hundreds of diplomatic protests against China over the past years for harassing Filipino fishermen and troops amid their claims in over 90 percent of the WPS.The most recent incident was the near-collision between a Chinese Coast Guard and Philippine Coast Guard vessel in waters around Ayungin Shoal on April 23.ADVERTISEMENTThe BRP Malapascua and BRP Malabrigo were also reportedly shadowed by Chinese navy and coast guard ships, and ordered to leave the waters several times during the seven-day maritime patrol carried out by the Philippine Coast Guard in WPS from April 18 to 24.ADVERTISEMENTChina said the incident was caused by the Philippines’ “premeditated and provocative action,” noting that the Philippine boats ""intruded"" their territory without permission, a claim dismissed by Philippine authorities maintaining that their operation was “non-provocative and did not undermine the interests of other states.” (SunStar Philippines)"

11,A tense week at sea as Philippine coast guard faces China,,"May 02, 2023","WHEN two Philippine Coast Guard vessels set out to patrol the volatile South China Sea recently, they had to face more than China’s growing territorial ambitions.The Associated Press and three other news agencies were invited by the Philippine coast guard two weeks ago to join a 1,670-kilometer (1,038-mile) patrol of one of the world’s most fiercely contested seas.The invitation was part of a new Philippine strategy aimed at bringing attention to China’s increasingly aggressive actions in the South China Sea. China has rapidly built up its military presence in the area in recent years, pushing back other claimants like the Philippines and building artificial islands with airstrips and military garrisons. The rich fishing archipelago is believed to sit atop vast undersea deposits of oil and gas.The Philippines dispatch regular patrols to assert their claims to the islands, spot encroachments, and resupply Filipino sailors stationed on the islands. Arrayed against far larger and more powerful fleets of Chinese coast guard vessels, navy warships and seaborne militias, the Philippine coast guard says its patrol vessels often face David and Goliath confrontations, especially near Beijing’s artificial island bases.The BRP Malabrigo and BRP Malapascua, Japanese-built 44-meter (144-foot) patrol ships, planned to make a circuit of disputed islands, islets and reefs claimed by the Philippines in the Spratly Islands, some occupied by Philippine garrisons and some by Chinese military installations.ADVERTISEMENTThe voyage provided a glimpse of what it's like for Filipino coast guard personnel to work on the frontlines of multiple geopolitical conflicts, while facing a constant battle against sun, sea, stress and gnawing isolation.The sailors, a mix of sunburned veterans and sprightly recruits, brought cellphones brimming with personal photographs and videos and games.Life on patrol was a mix of hard work and claustrophobic leisure. It was often so hot that sailors got dizzy after a few minutes outside, so crewmembers spent most of their down time between four-hour shifts in tiny, air conditioned cabins. When there was room in the mess hall, a few people might gather to watch a film or sing on the karaoke machine — a Filipino necessity. Some liked to take walks in the ship’s narrow passages.The two ships visited one or two destinations a day, working without interruption day and night. The easiest stops were at places occupied by Filipino forces, where the ships sent motor launches to deliver basic supplies like water, crude oil and cigarettes. At one, thirsty sailors offered dried fish in exchange for extra drinking water.Visits to Chinese-controlled areas were harder. At one reef, the patrol encountered more than 100 small Chinese boats, suspected of belonging to the militia, anchored in groups. The Filipinos lowered launches and demanded the boats leave Philippine waters. The Chinese boats did not reply, or leave.ADVERTISEMENTThey faced off with the Chinese Coast Guard at Chinese-occupied Subi Reef, and later at the Second Thomas Shoal, which is occupied by Filipino sailors on a beached, crumbling navy ship, surrounded by Chinese ships.These encounters are tense, drawn-out affairs. Chinese coast guard and navy ships shadowed the patrol for more than an hour, and over the radio accused the Filipinos of intruding into what Beijing claims as its territorial waters and ordered them by radio to leave or face unspecified counter actions.A radio operator, holding a paper script in the corner of the bridge, asserted Philippine sovereign rights and asked the Chinese ships to stay away and abide by international anti-collision regulations.Meanwhile, the rest of the bridge was quiet, and intensely focused. A radar operator watched intently for tiny changes in the other ship’s speed or bearing. When it approached one knot faster, the commander barked an order to alter the Malabrigos’s speed in response. The encounter lasted for more than an hour.ADVERTISEMENTCommander Julio Colarina III, 41, was a 24-hour fixture on the bridge of the Malabrigo, where he slept on a folding bed when off duty. He’s a second-generation defender of the Philippines’ territorial interests. His father, a retired navy man, spent a year in the 1970s garrisoning Philippine-occupied Thitu Island.As crew members rested between four-hour shifts on the bridge, the strains of classic rock hits like “Hotel California” could be heard from the mess hall. One night, a sailor celebrated her birthday in stark austerity: colleagues put a candle on an omelet and prepared sardines, fried fish and rice to mark the occasion.Asked for a birthday wish, the 27-year-old said, “peace and good health always.”On April 23, the second to last day of the voyage, journalists witnessed a cliffhanger encounter when a Chinese coast guard ship blocked the Malapascua as it tried to steam toward the Second Thomas Shoal, as the crew fell silent. The Malapascua’s Capt. Rodel Hernandez said a near-collision was averted when he abruptly reversed his vessel’s direction and shut off its engine to bring the vessel to a full stop.ADVERTISEMENTThe journalists captured the dangerous confrontation on video and cameras, sparking a new round of arguments between Manila and Beijing. The Philippines criticized China for “highly dangerous maneuvers” that it said endangered the Philippine patrol vessels and its crewmembers.China said the Filipino vessels barged into its territorial waters laden with journalists in a “premeditated provocation designed to deliberately create a friction” intending to lay the blame on Beijing.Petty Officer 2nd Class Reggie Lobusta, who has been deployed to the disputed region multiple times in the past, said he felt like he’d just finished yet another round in a long boxing match, with no end in sight.“There will be far worse than what we’ve encountered if these problems are not addressed properly,” Lobusta said.The patrols are considered some of the most difficult assignments in the Philippine Coast Guard. The entire crew was to undergo brief sessions with psychologists in a “stress debrief” after their return to shore, Colarina said, and received half a month’s salary as hazard pay.ADVERTISEMENTAs the Malabrigo headed home after seven days, more crewmembers than usual milled and chatted on the deck, taking selfies with cellphone cameras as the sun set in the background.“It’s our morale booster — the sunsets, sunrises, dolphins and green turtles,” said Lobusta. “It will break my heart when I retire and leave this ship and my second family here one final time.” (AP)"

They are in the process of conducting an evaluation of how much more generators they will need,” Bautista said.ADVERTISEMENT“The 30 percent that they mentioned was based on the original capacity of Terminal 3, but Terminal 3 has expanded operations, there are more concessionaires now, and that’s the reason they will have to conduct an assessment... based on the result of the assessment, they will make a recommendation to the board on how many more generators they will purchase or rent,” he added.In a press conference, MIAA general manager Cesar Chiong said the audit may take 60 to 90 days.

20,Marcos raises near-crash incident in WPS with China,Third Anne Peralta-Malonzo,"May 01, 2023","PRESIDENT Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. has directed the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) to identify the country’s fishing ground in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) amid the ongoing dispute in the territory with China.In an interview with reporters aboard a flight on the way to the United States (US), Marcos reiterated the government’s priority to ensure the fishing rights of the Filipinos in the area.“I mean, of course, the overall priority is to safeguard our maritime territory but when you go down into the details, the most immediate, let’s say, concern are the fishing rights. So that’s what we have to do. That’s what we have to decide and they have agreed again to sit down,” he said.“I’ve asked the Coast Guard and the DFA to put together perhaps a map of these fishing grounds that sasabihin natin, ito Pilipinas talaga ito and we’ll see what they say when we give them our proposal,” he added.Marcos made the statement in light of a near-crash incident between a Chinese and Filipino vessel in the waters around Ayungin Shoal last week.ADVERTISEMENTChina said the incident was caused by the Philippines’ “premeditated and provocative action,” noting that the Philippine boats ""intruded"" their territory without permission.The Philippine Coast Guard, however, maintained that the maritime patrol it carried out in the WPS was “non-provocative and did not undermine the interests of other states.”It maintained that the area falls within the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone.Marcos said he urged China to finish the creation of the team who will handle a high level of communication with the Philippines to avoid similar incidents that could cost lives.The Chief Executive said the Philippines has already created its own team and their names and phone numbers were already given to China.ADVERTISEMENTDuring his state visit to China in the first week of the year, Marcos and Chinese President Xi Jinping committed to establishing a “direct communication mechanism” to prevent possible miscommunication on issues concerning the WPS.The Philippine government had repeatedly called out China over claims of harassment by Filipino fishermen in the WPS.China is claiming sea areas falling within the nine-dash line, which is over 90 percent of the WPS.ADVERTISEMENTThe Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, Netherlands already ruled that China’s claim has no legal basis while it affirmed the traditional and legitimate fishing rights of Filipino fishermen in the area.ADVERTISEMENTChina refused to recognize the arbitral ruling.
