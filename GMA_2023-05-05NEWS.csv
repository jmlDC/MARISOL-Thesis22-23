0,"Over 4,000 motorcycle road crashes recorded from January to April, PNP-HPG says","By JOVILAND RITA, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-05," Philippine National Police - Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG) on Friday expressed concern over the high number of road crashes involving motorcycles.  “For the past year, ang nakita naming mataas ang concern namin is two wheel vehicles, mga motor, 'yun kasi ang mataas ang statistics in terms of road crash incident,” PNP-HPG chief Police Brigadier General Raul Bargamento told reporters.  (For the past year, we had a high concern on two-wheel vehicles because of the high number of road crash accidents.)  Based on PNP-HPG data, a total of 4,029 incidents were reported from January to April this year. Meanwhile, 8,342 incidents were reported in 2022.  Due to this, Bargamento said he directed PNP-HPG regional units to conduct road safety seminars especially for motorcycle groups. He said he monitored many local and national biker groups in the country now.  Bargamento also reminded motorcycle drivers to be cautious and disciplined on the road as well as to always follow traffic rules and laws to avoid accidents.  “'Yung mga drivers natin ng motor, kaunting ingat po. Huwag tayong kumpiyansa. Dahil gumagamit tayo ng motor, maging disiplinado tayo. Lagi nating sundin ang batas trapiko,” he said.  (I advise our motorcycle drivers to be extra careful. Do not be complacent. Because we are using motorcycles, let’s be disciplined and always follow traffic rules.)  Meanwhile, Bargamento said he is eyeing to deploy their additional motorcycles and mobiles to provincial units so they can also conduct operations in their areas.  “May mga probinsya po kami na wala pang Highway Patrol na nadestino because wala kaming mobility asset na magagamit,” he said.  (There are provinces with no Highway Patrol because we do not have assets to use.)  Also, Bargamento said the PNP-HPG is set to sign a memorandum of agreement with the Land Transportation Office (LTO) for the interconnectivity of their systems in June.  He said it will speed up the access of HPG personnel to LTO’s records on vehicles and drivers.  On Friday, the PNP-HPG celebrated its 68th founding anniversary through a ceremony at Camp Crame.—AOL, GMA Integrated News

1,CAAP shortens May 17 air traffic management system maintenance to 2 hours,"By TED CORDERO, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-05," The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) on Friday announced that its scheduled Air Traffic Management Center (ATMC) corrective maintenance activity on May 17 would only take two hours rather than the previously announced six hours.
 The May 17 maintenance activity would begin at 2 a.m. and end at 4 a.m. instead of from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m. “based on careful process reviews and simulations.”
 “As a result of coordination with stakeholders, CAAP already canceled the initial Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), and issued NOTAM B1553/23 as of today,” the agency said.
 Aviation authorities had previously announced that the country’s airspace would be shut down on May 17 to give way for maintenance activities on the country’s air traffic management system to avoid a repeat of the infamous New Year’s Day shutdown.
 The CAAP said it would implement contingency procedures through direct coordination with adjacent Flight Information Regions (FIRs), which will help to minimize disruption to air traffic operations.
 The agency said that all necessary measures were being taken to ensure the safety and efficiency of air travel during the maintenance activity.
 “We apologize for any inconvenience that this schedule change may cause, and we appreciate your understanding and cooperation as we work to maintain the recommended standards of air traffic management in the country,” it said. — DVM, GMA Integrated News

3,Marcos says disengagement with China 'not an option',"By ANNA FELICIA BAJO, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-05," WASHINGTON — President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. on Thursday (US time) said the Philippines will continue to balance its relations with China while defending its sovereignty, noting that disengagement with Beijing is not an option.
 During a question-and-answer session at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) on the last day of his official US visit, Marcos was asked how Manila will maintain a stable relationship with Beijing while defending its sovereignty amid continued harassment in the South China Sea.
 In response, Marcos said, ""Well, in the same way that we maintain our relationship with the US, we constantly consult with our allies and partners. We constantly keep our lines of communications open.""
 He reiterated the importance of having direct communication with Chinese President Xi Jinping as well as other important Chinese officials to avoid misunderstandings on various issues.
 ""I suggested that we institute a system wherein we have a direct contact, one president to the other, and in that way, no matter if I cannot speak for example to President Xi himself, I have someone that I can pick up the phone and call who I know and I have confidence in making my message to the President. And this works, of course, both ways,"" Marcos said.
 ""If the President of the People’s Republic would like a message to arrive to me then we have a system in place, we are — we have a system in place to achieve that and we are still working on it, our Secretary of Foreign Affairs is working on the details of that — well I refer to it as a hotline really,"" he added.
 ""And hopefully that soon, we will have that in place, we will have that functioning and in that way —  disengagement is really not an option."" 
 His response came after the incident in Spratly Islands where a Filipino and a Chinese vessel nearly crashed.
 Marcos also said the Philippines would maintain its foreign policy of being ""a friend to all and enemy to none"" as he cited the significance of engaging with ASEAN member-states and other Asian nations.
 ""Our foreign policy is almost simplistic when I describe it because our foreign policy is based on the pursuit of peace, our foreign policy is based on the promotion of our national interest,"" he said.
 ""That seems the only way because we certainly do not want to provoke a more serious situation than it is already now. We certainly do not want to cause an incident by misjudgment, by mistake, that will elevate the conflict from what it is now to a higher level."" —KBK, GMA Integrated News

 ""Sabi ko naman ay palagay ko dahil magkakilala kami dapat naman ay napakalaking bagay na siyang kokoranahan bilang hari ng United Kingdom, ay dapat makapag-attend na ako,"" Marcos said.
 [Since I know him, it would be good if I would be there during his coronation.]

 [I will be meeting with their new Prime Minister and discuss with him the Philippines' partnership with the UK.]
 ""Sa palagay ko ay ganoon din ang sasabihin niya na dapat papatibayin natin. At naghihingalo, hirap na hirap ang ekonomiya ng UK so baka isang bagay ‘yun na pag-uusapan namin kung papaano mag-trade, kung papaano dagdagan…"" Marcos added.
 [I think he would say the same ... with UK's economy not doing good ... so I think we will discuss how to trade.]
 Marcos said they could possibly discuss Filipino healthcare workers as they gain attention amid the pandemic because of their good service.
 ""We will maintain the same relationship, it has been a very --- a relationship very advantageous to all parties involved so I think that we will stay the course and continue to deal with each other in very similar way that we have done before,"" Marcos said.
 Marcos also said other world leaders have asked to have casual conversations with him. He did not, however, identify them.
 ""So very casual lang ito, very informal pero huwag natin mamaliitin ‘yang mga ganyang klaseng meeting. Dahil kung minsan, ‘yung hindi mo aakalain mangyayari, may nangyayari na napaka-importante pala,"" Marcos said.
 [It will be very casual, very informal, But let us not belittle those kind of meetings. Sometimes, important things happen there.] 
 Marcos said the plane that would carry him will land at Gatwick Airport.
 ""Usually, hindi sa Gatwick ang pinupuntahan ngunit ngayon ay pupuntahan ko ‘yung Gatwick dahil titingnan ko ‘yung operation ng kanilang airport kung bagay ba ito --- ‘yung mga lessons learned nila, ‘yung mga ginagawa nila, kung best practices ‘yan na puwede nating dalhin sa Pilipinas,"" he said.

5,Marcos: Abuses linked to war on drugs committed during 'previous administration',"By ANNA FELICIA BAJO, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-05," WASHINGTON —President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. said Thursday (Washington time) that there had been abuses committed during the ""previous administration"" in the war on illegal drugs, which he said focused too much on law enforcement.
 ""In my view what had happened in the previous administration is that we focused very much on enforcement. And because of that, it could be said that there are abuses by certain elements in the government and that has caused some concern with many, in many quarters about the human rights situation in the Philippines,” Marcos said in a forum organized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
 “Well, I cannot speak to what my predecessor had in mind and what his idea was. But what I can speak is to the policy that we have undertaken and that I said the drug war continues to be at the source of many --- much criminality in the Philippines,” he added.
 He said that syndicates have grown ""stronger, wealthier, more influential, worryingly so.""
 ""Instead of going after everyone, I tried to identify the key areas that we have to tackle, attend to so that we can see a diminution of the activities of the drug syndicates,"" he added.    
 In a separate interview with reporters, Marcos was asked to assess Duterte's drug campaign.
 He said: ""I’m in no position to assess the administration of anybody else. That is not proper for me --- that’s not a proper role for me to take.""
 Marcos has since said his administration would focus on rehabilitation to curb the drug menace.
 The President also said dismantling drug syndicates is necessary to address the problem.
 “So, the change in policy, I believe is much more focused. I always say that the previous administration was focused on enforcement. We have taken enforcement as far as we can,” Marcos said.
 “Now, it is time to look at actually going after dismantling these syndicates and before that we should also look at --- not the rehabilitation of those who have already fallen into this drug culture which has destroyed their lives,” he added.
 Asked for comment on Marcos' remarks, lawyer Harry Roque, former spokesperson of Duterte, said the former president ""never said that drug war was perfect.""
 ""He repeatedly warned the PNP that when they are on the right, he's solidly behind them. They're on their own when they violate the law,"" Roque told GMA News Online.
 Roque also said the anti-drug campaign was one of Duterte's few campaign promises which he delivered.
 ""Probably the reason why he enjoys the highest trust and approval rating of any past president,"" he said. —LDF/RSJ, GMA Integrated News

6,"Tobacco smokers struggling to quit have options, says group","By GISELLE OMBAY, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-05," Adult tobacco smokers who wish to quit the vice should be given more alternatives to help in their gradual decrease of nicotine consumption, a research group said on Thursday.
 In a media forum, ASCRA Consulting Inc.’s project coordinator Joze Songsong introduced the concept of Tobacco Harm Reduction (THR) which would provide options or safer nicotine products —like e-cigarettes or vaping products, heated tobacco products, snus and US smokeless —and nicotine replacement therapy such as patches, gums, lozenges, sprays, and inhalers, for tobacco users who are struggling to quit smoking.
 He explained that millions of Filipinos need to be protected from the dangers of smoking, but some of them are really in need of support in terms of smoking cessation.
 “Through Tobacco Harm Reduction, what we want to do is to empathize with those adult smokers who can't immediately quit because either they use nicotine as a way to alleviate the different social circumstances that force them into this particular lifestyle or habit,” Songsong said.
 “What we want to do is not to advocate for a specific type of cure for these Filipino smokers but to equip them with the right information and the tools to make those informed decisions because these Filipino smokers have the right to informed choices and have the right to make choices for their own health,” he added.
 Results of the 2021 Global Adult Tobacco Survey showed that the prevalence of current tobacco use and smoking among Filipinos aged 15 and above decreased in 2021 to 19.5% of the population or 15.1 million.
 The survey also showed that the quit rate among past 12-month smokers (or those who have reported smoking within the last 12 months) in the country decreased from 4.5% in 2009 to 3.9% in 2021.
 However, the number of adult smokers thinking of quitting because of health warnings increased from 37.4% in 2009 to 43.7% in 2021.
 Dr. Ehsan Latif, Senior Vice President of Foundation for Smoke-free World, said that the Philippines should learn from the progress of other countries like Japan and United Kingdom, which implement harm reduction methods.
 “We can't expect people to quit smoking in just a day. The challenge is how we interact with the private sector. It’s not dependent on one sect
 The Department of Health has been persistently warning Filipinos about the harmful effects of smoke and emissions from tobacco products, vapor products, and heated tobacco products.
 It could be recalled that the controversial vape bill lapsed into law in 2022, providing regulations on the importation, manufacture, sale, packaging, distribution, use, and communication of vape products and novel tobacco products.—LDF, GMA Integrated News

7,Filipino family in Sudan walked 5 km to escape war zone,By GMA Integrated News,2023-05-05," A Filipino family with young kids braved their way through the battlefield and headed towards the Egyptian border by foot in order to escape war-torn Sudan.
 In JP Soriano's report on “24 Oras” on Thursday,  Anthony Lucas — one of the 74 repatriates to arrive back in the Philippines —  said he, his wife, and their three children left their residence and walked at least five kilometers to get out of the war zone.

 He said they had to be careful and took cover to avoid being dragged into the crossfire.
 “Ongoing ‘yung bombing tsaka yung gunfire. 'Yung artillery medyo heavy.  Hindi kami dapat kabahan hindi kami dapat matakot kasi may mga bata...Kailangan malakas kami para hindi ma trauma ang mga bata,” he added.
 (The bombings and gunfire were ongoing. The artillery was also heavy. We really tried not to be scared for our kids. We needed to be strong so they would not be traumatized.)
 More than 300 Filipinos have entered Egypt according to Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) Administrator Arnell Ignacio. Over 100, meanwhile, have fled Sudan but have yet to cross the border.
 “Ang magandang balita, wala na tayong pinoproblema na delikado sa Khartoum. Nakuha na natin,” said Ignacio.
 (The good news is, there are no stranded victims in Khartoum. We’ve evacuated them.)
 All repatriates from Sudan will receive P100,000 worth of financial assistance from the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) and the OWWA.

 One of the instructions of the Health Department is for the facilities to ensure continuous water supply to avoid hiccups in their operations, according to Lei Alviz’s report on “24 Oras”.
 They were also asked to store potable water that would last for three days, to have a reserve water supply, and to repair all damaged faucets and busted pipes.
 The National Kidney and Transplant Institute (NKTI), for its part, had its deep well facility readied in case there will be a water supply shortage. Constructed in 2021, it is connected to the Lung Center of the Philippines and was built by Manila Water.

 At the public briefing, LPP chairperson and Quirino Governor Dax Cua said through the local government units (LGUs), they will be closely monitoring the students and schools which are one of the superspreader venues.
 Cua said they will be coordinating with the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Department of Health (DOH).
 “We will be monitoring closely, ang mga LGUs babantayan natin ang mga kabataan natin, yung mga eskwelahan kasi yan po ang isa sa mga superspreader venue yung mga klase pagka dyan eh kumalat ang COVID eh halos lahat ng pamilya eh aabutin,” he said.

 The DOH earlier reported a 42% increase in the average daily new COVID-19 cases from April 24-30, 2023.
 The DOH, however, said it has recommended to President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. not to bring back the mandatory wearing of face masks amid the rising COVID-19 cases.
 It added that the recent rise in COVID-19 cases does not translate to more severe and critical cases or even deaths.
 Meanwhile, the seven-day COVID-19 positivity rate in Metro Manila has gone past 20% as of May 3, OCTA Research said on Thursday.

12,"Teves, sons file motion to dismiss illegal possession of firearms raps","By JOAHNA LEI CASILAO, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-05," Suspended Negros Oriental Representative Arnolfo “Arnie” Teves Jr. and his sons have filed a consolidated motion seeking to dismiss the complaint of illegal possession of firearms and explosives against them, their camps said Friday.
 Teves’ legal counsel, Atty. Ferdinand Topacio, said they are questioning the legality of the search conducted in his client's houses back in March. 
 “Sapagkat wala po sa ating procedure na may papasok muna sa isang lugar na ise-search na walang witnesses after one hour saka ise-search. ‘Yun ang pagkakataoon na mag tanim ng ebidensya,” Topacio said in an ambush interview.
 (Because there is nothing in our procedure that says that you can enter without witnesses and then conduct a search after an hour. That is a chance to plant evidence.)
 Due to this, Atty. Edward Santiago of Teves’ camp believes the evidence submitted by the complainants will be inadmissible under the doctrine of the fruit of the poisonous tree. 
 “Admitted din naman nila doon sa complaint nila na nag conduct ng— merong team of SAF personnel na nag conduct ng clearing… bago nila inimplement yung actual search,” he said.
 (They also admitted in the complaint that there was a SAF team that conducted a clearing of the area before they implemented the actual search.)
 “So… the evidence na na-gather nila are inadmissible as evidence as in the doctrine of the fruit of the poisonous tree,” he added.
 (So, the evidence that they gathered is inadmissible as evidence in the doctrine of the fruit of the poisonous tree.)
 Santiago said another complaint of illegal possession of firearms and explosives against Teves was dismissed back in March and they are confident the present complaint will also be dismissed.
 According to Atty. Andres Manuel, the legal counsel of Teves’ sons Kurt and Axel, the complaint has been submitted for resolution.
 The Department of Justice is seeking to designate and proscribe Teves as a terrorist to force him to surrender to authorities.
 Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla had said that the complaint of illegal possession of firearms and explosives that was filed against Teves was enough basis to do so.
 Topacio has said that the lawmaker does not own the firearms allegedly retrieved from his houses.
 Degamo killing
 Meanwhile, Topacio also questioned the evidence of authorities over claims that Teves appears to be the mastermind behind the killing of Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo on March 4.
 “Well, para sa akin ah, well ito lang from my point of view as a defense lawyer kung wala kang ebidensya eh talagang hindi ka makaka file kasi baka mapahiya ka lang pag dating sa korte,” he said.
 (Well, for me, from my point of view as a defense lawyer, if you have no evidence, you cannot file because you will only get shamed when it reaches the court.)
 “So, two months after na tag na si Congressman Teves as the mastermind, as the brains behind the assassination, they are still scrambling for evidence, Wala pa rin. Otherwise, they would have filed it,” Topacio added.
 (So, two months after Congressman Teves was tagged as a mastermind, as the brains behind the assassination, they are still scrambling for evidence. Otherwise, they would have already filed it.)
 Back in March, two suspects in the killing of Degamo named a certain “Cong Teves” as the person behind the fatal attack against the local official.
 Teves has yet to return to the country amid fears for his safety. He has appealed for fairness, saying he will come home ""when it is safe enough"" or when the trial is fair.
 “We are still assessing the situation. We will see whether we can get a fair trial,” Topacio said when asked if Teves maintains his stance on his refusal to return to the country.
 Topacio said he regularly talks to the lawmaker to update him on what is happening, adding that Teves remains in “high spirits.”
 “He is comforted by the fact na talaga namang wala siyang kinalaman dito sa pagpatay dito kay Governor Degamo atsaka yung ibang binibintang sa kanya,” he said.
 (He is comforted by the fact that he is really not involved in the killing of Governor Degamo and the other allegations against him.)
 Last month, Remulla said Teves apeared to be ""the main mastermind"" in the Degamo slay and that the National Bureau of Investigation will file murder, multiple murder, and multiple frustrated murder complaints against him and eight others. —VAL, GMA Integrated News

 Department of National Defense officer-in-charge Undersecretary Carlito Galvez and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have established the bilateral defense guidelines between the two countries to modernize the alliance cooperation ""for a free and open Indo-Pacific region.""
 The said guidelines ""reaffirmed that an armed attack in the Pacific, including anywhere in the South China Sea, on either of their aircraft or armed forces – which includes their Coast Guards – would invoke mutual defense commitments under the 1951 PH-US Mutual Defense Treaty.""
 Manila and Washington should expand cooperation on maritime security and maritime domain awareness, including through the continued conduct of combined maritime activities, including but not limited to joint patrols.
 In a separate interview with reporters, Marcos was asked about the evolution of the treaty.
 He responded that what was just finished were the guidelines of the new provisions of the treaty.

 “No. The short answer is no,” Marcos said.
 Marcos disclosed that the US also never asked for the sites under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) to be used as staging points for any attacks against other nations.
 “To be fair, the United States has never brought up the possibility that we will use, that the United States will use the EDCA sites as staging areas for any offensive actions against any countries,” Marcos said.
 “The United States has never said that this is a possibility and we’ve also made it clear to our end that this is not the purpose of those sites and this is not the way that they will be used,” he added.
 The President also mentioned that he personally guaranteed to Chinese Foreign Minister Qiin Gang, who recently visited Manila, that these sites would not be utilized as military bases that will be used to attack other countries.
 “No, these are not intended to be military bases to attack, to move against anyone, any country, not China, not any country… again we turn back to the simple concept of our foreign policy and it is the we’re continuing work that we would like to be involved in the pursuit of peace and that continues to be the case,” he explained.
 Malacañang recently announced four new EDCA sites: Naval Base Camilo Osias in Sta Ana, Cagayan; Lal-lo Airport in Lal-lo, Cagayan; Camp Melchor Dela Cruz in Gamu, Isabela; and Balabac Island in Palawan.
 Existing EDCA sites are Antonio Bautista Air Base in Palawan, Basa Air Base in Pampanga, Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija, Mactan-Benito Ebuen Air Base in Cebu, and Lumbia Air Base in Cagayan de Oro City.
 China has since criticized the latest EDCA sites, saying that this will only draw the Philippines into conflict.
 Marcos and United States President Joe Biden have expressed the need to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.  In a joint statement of the two leaders following their meeting at the White House, it was said that they have affirmed the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of global security and prosperity.
 China and Taiwan split at the end of a civil war in 1949. China has since viewed democratic Taiwan as part of its territory.
 The US, for its part, has been deliberately ambiguous on whether it would defend Taiwan militarily.—LDF, GMA Integrated News

17,"Cope Thunder interoperability exercises between PAF, USAF underway",By GMA Integrated News,2023-05-05," The interoperability exercise between the United States and the Philippine Air Forces known as Cope Thunder is underway.
 According to Raffy Tima's report on ""24 Oras,"" the two countries began holding Cope Thunder exercises in the 1970s,until Mount Pinatubo's eruption forced the curtailment of operations at Clark Air Base, where they were being held.
 The PAF said since the Philippines has fighter jets again and the US Air Force's 4th generation F-16 fighter jets are still in the country, it is just right to resume the training.
 ""Its actually a revival of the name Cope Thunder because it has been a continuing activity for the past years. So basically, it's the same objective for us to maintain our interoperability,"" said AFPAO Chief Colonel Bon Castillo.
 In a statement, the PAF said that the first phase of Cope Thunder will be held from May 1 to 12, while the second one will run from July 2 to 21. The exercise  involves 160 US Air Force members and 400 PAF members from different units.
 The first iteration includes primary flight operations at Clark Air Base, Pampanga—including ""integration flights on various air-to-air combat scenarios to improve interoperability between the two air forces,"" said PAF, and subject matter expert exchanges at Basa Air Base in Floridablanca, Pampanga.
 The training of the two sides will be more extensive in the second iteration.
 ""They are going to simulate that there will be large forces moving in certain deployment areas, probably overseas. There will be large aircraft movement going up to Visayas and Mindanao,"" said Castillo.
 Twelve US F-16 fighters based in Japan will take part in Cope Thunder, flying with PAF's FA-50 fighter jets.
 Cope Thunder aims to enhance the capabilities and readiness of PAF and Pacific Air Forces to respond to potential threats in the region. — Sherylin Untalan/BM, GMA Integrated News

19,Critics say US using Philippines for its own agenda vs. China,"By JOVILAND RITA, GMA Integrated News",2023-05-04," A geopolitics expert, a progressive lawmaker, and members of fishermen's and progressive groups on Thursday weighed in on recent developments in the US-Philippine military alliance, saying that the US is using its military clout and superiority to restrain the growing power of China, and that the Philippines could be dragged into tensions between the two powers.
 “Yung deployment ng US troops dito sa pamamagitan ng mga EDCA bases, lahat ito malinaw naman na nakatuon sa estratehiya ng US. Ang US gusto niya sagkain 'yung paglakas ng China,” analyst and UP professor Roland Simbulan said at the Pandesal Forum at the Kamuning Bakery in Quezon City.
 (The deployment of US troops here through the EDCA bases clearly focuses on the US strategy to restrain the growth of China.)
 He added that the recent meeting between Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. and US President Joe Biden in Washington was, for him, ""a joint US-Philippine agreement to violate in this regard the 1972 joint China-US Shanghai Communiqué and also to violate correspondingly the Philippine-China opening of diplomatic relations where we in fact recognized that Taiwan is a part of China.""
 China views democratic Taiwan as part of its territory, and has vowed to one day seize it, by force if necessary.
 Last month, after Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-Wen met with US Speaker Kevin McCarthy, China launched three days of military exercises around Taiwan in which it practiced encircling it and sealing it off.
 “Tayo talaga ay madadamay [We will be dragged into the conflict],” Simbulan said.
 In response, US Embassy Press Attaché Kanishka Gangopadhyay said that the Marcos-Biden meeting ""reaffirms the longstanding, ironclad alliance between the United States and the Philippines, which has contributed to peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and around the world for more than 70 years.""
 ""For decades, we’ve worked together to promote peace, prosperity, and stability across the region, and we’re growing that effective partnership in scale and scope every single day,"" he added.
 China opposition to EDCA
 The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) between the Philippines and the US grants US troops access to designated Philippine military facilities, allows them to build facilities, and pre-position equipment, aircraft and vessels.
 In February, the Department of National Defense announced a deal that gave American troops access to four more bases in strategic areas of the country, with the aim of accelerating EDCA's full implementation.
 Three of the four newly designated EDCA sites are in northern Philippines, near Taiwan.
 Days after the Chinese exercises around Taiwan, Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian said that the Philippines should ""unequivocally oppose"" Taiwan independence instead of offering the US access to its military facilities near the Taiwan Strait if it cares about the 150,000 OFWs on the self-ruled island.
 The statement sparked outrage and condemnation from several sectors, with Gabriela Representative Arlene Brosas saying Huang ""crossed the line"" and Senator Risa Hontiveros declaring that Huang should be recalled by Beijing.
 The Chinese embassy said that Huang had been ""misquoted.""
 'Toxic'
 At the Pentagon on Wednesday, the US and the Philippines released the first ever bilateral defense guidelines, seen as a reaffirmation that ""an armed attack in the Pacific, including anywhere in the South China Sea, on either of their aircraft or armed forces—which includes their Coast Guards—would invoke mutual defense commitments under the 1951 Philippines-US Mutual Defense Treaty.""
 The guidelines are also seen as an upgrade to the Philippines and the US’ security ties by “institutionaliz[ing] key bilateral priorities, mechanisms, and processes to deepen alliance cooperation and interoperability across land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace.”
 At the Pandesal Forum, International League of Peoples' Struggle general secretary Liza Maza called the guidelines a “sellout.”
 Maza said the Philippines will open its strategic security and defense plan to the US, but that the sharing would not go the other way.
 “Tayo ba open ba sa atin ang strategic and tactical security and defense plan ng US? Of course not,” she said.
 (Is the strategic and tactical security and defense plan of the US open to us? Of course not.)
 Maza also called a “bribe” the development aid that the US will give to the communities where the EDCA sites are being built.
 “Bigyan mo ng ilang proyekto para maalis mo 'yung mangingisda, tanggalin mo 'yung mga community doon para magamit mo 'yung site para sa military agenda mo,” she said.
 (The projects are there so they can remove the fisherfolk and communities and they can use the site for their military agenda.)
 She said these developments are worrisome, adding that the Philippines and US have a ""toxic"" relationship.
 Fishers group PAMALAKAYA spokesperson Ronnel Arambulo said they do not believe that the US will help the Philippines when it comes to China's aggression against Filipino fisherfolk—and that the US will only ""provoke"" China.
 “Ito ay magiging dahilan pa para doon sa probokasyon sa China na pwede maipit pa rin ang mangingisda at lalo pang mang-harass ang Chinese government, partikular diyan sa West Philippine Sea,” he said.
 (This will lead to the provocation of China where fisherfolk will be caught in the crossfire and China will harass them even more in the West Philippine Sea.)
 'Flashpoint'
 Meanwhile, House deputy minority leader ACT Teachers Representative France Castro said the US is using the tension between China and Philippines in the West Philippines Sea to increase the number of EDCA sites.
 Instead of de-escalating the situation, Castro said, the US is aggravating it “so the West Philippine Sea may reach a flashpoint.”
 She suggested demilitarizing the area.
 “Ang US naman in-exploit niya yung strategic location ng ating bansa to advance its geopolitical agenda to the detriment of the Filipino people,” Castro said.
 (The US is exploiting the strategic location of our country to advance its geopolitical agenda to the detriment of the Filipino people.)

20,PNP’s gun simulator system to help cops shoot better... sans bullets,By GMA Integrated News,2023-05-04," The Philippine National Police has acquired a firearm simulator system which can help the law enforcers improve their marksmanship without the use of bullets.
 According to Jun Veneracion's report on ""24 Oras"", the PNP aims to improve the shooting proficiency of police personnel as 20% fail their marksmanship training.
 With the simulator system, shooters use real guns but not bullets. The barrel is instead replaced by a laser system while the magazine contains CO2.
 Targets are on a high-definition screen.
 “Itong magazine is ang laman nito ay CO2 para bawat kalabit mo meron syang recoil para syang tunay na baril ang effect nya,” contact point INC Ruel De Luna said.
 (This magazine is filled with CO2 so every time you pull the trigger, it has a recoil like it's a real gun.)
 “Malamang po makukuha nyo na sa aktwal maganda pong start ito,” certified range safety officer P/LT. Mary Cris Acosta said.
 (You will probably get it off to a good start.)
 The PNP can provide only limited ammunition for the mandatory marksmanship training of 228,000 police officers.
 The PNP spends more than half a billion pesos on ammunition every year for training.
 This is compared to the simulator which costs at least P6 million.
 “With this simulator mapapataas pa natin ang proficiency nila kasi nga one to sawa sila mga PNP kami so dapat 100% proficient kami,” Police Colonel Radel Ramos, PNP training service acting director, said.
 (With this simulator we can increase their proficiency even more because they can use it unlimited so the PNP must be 100% proficient.)
 The police officers will also benefit from the simulator because the bullets cost P26 to P28 for extra training.
 “Kahit anong oras pwede kami mag practice na walang nilalabas na pera sir,” Police Trainee Joseller Joseph Col said.
 (We can practice at any time without spending any money.)
 The simulator system is currently only in Camp Crame. However, the PNP training service is planning to extend it per region. —Richa Noriega/NB, GMA Integrated News

21,China opposes ‘meddling’ in South China Sea amid PH-US defense guidelines,By GMA Integrated News,2023-05-04," China is opposed to what it called meddling in the South China Sea to harm its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign affairs ministry said on Thursday.
 Foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning made the remark in a news briefing when asked about the Philippines and US' bilateral defense guidelines which spelled out how the US will come to the Philippines' defense if it came under attack in the South China Sea.
 ""With the concerted efforts of regional countries, the situation in the South China Sea has maintained overall stability. The US-Philippines defense guidelines is a bilateral arrangement,"" Mao said.
 ""China firmly opposes any country’s move to meddle in the South China Sea issue to harm China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests by citing the guidelines,"" she added.
 ""I would like to stress that the South China Sea is the shared home for countries in the region, not a hunting ground for forces outside the region. When regional countries are committed to mutual trust, solidarity, cooperation and properly handling differences, they have in their hand the key to peace and stability in the South China Sea,"" Mao said.
 Defense Department officer in charge Carlito Galvez and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in Washington established the bilateral defense guidelines between the two countries to modernize the alliance cooperation ""for a free and open Indo-Pacific region.""
 Under the guidelines, the Philippines and the US will expand cooperation on maritime security through but not limited to joint patrols.
 According to a fact sheet released by the White House, the goal is to expand cooperation on maritime security and maritime domain awareness, including through the continued conduct of combined maritime activities, including but not limited to joint patrol.
 The guidelines ""reaffirmed that an armed attack in the Pacific, including anywhere in the South China Sea, on either of their aircraft or armed forces – which includes their Coast Guards – would invoke mutual defense commitments under the 1951 PH-US Mutual Defense Treaty.""
 ""Recognizing that threats may arise in several domains—including land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace—and take the form of asymmetric, hybrid, and irregular warfare and gray-zone tactics, the guidelines chart a way forward to build interoperability in both conventional and non-conventional domains,"" the DOD fact sheet read.
 The guidelines aim to strengthen Manila and Washington's combined deterrence in an evolving security environment, including to:
