0,AI chatbots have been used to create dozens of news content farms,Bloomberg,"May 1, 2023 ","BLOOMBERG – The news-rating group NewsGuard has found dozens of news websites generated by AI chatbots proliferating online, according to a report published Monday, raising questions about how the technology may supercharge established fraud techniques.
The 49 websites, which were independently reviewed by Bloomberg, run the gamut. Some are dressed up as breaking news sites with generic-sounding names like News Live 79 and Daily Business Post, while others share lifestyle tips, celebrity news or publish sponsored content. But none disclose they’re populated using AI chatbots such as OpenAI Inc.’s ChatGPT and potentially Alphabet Inc.’s Google Bard, which can generate detailed text based on simple user prompts.
Many of the websites began publishing this year as the AI tools began to be widely used by the public.
In several instances, NewsGuard documented how the chatbots generated falsehoods for published pieces. In April alone, a website called CelebritiesDeaths.com published an article titled, “Biden dead. Harris acting President, address 9 a.m.” Another concocted facts about the life and works of an architect as part of a falsified obituary. And a site called TNewsNetwork published an unverified story about the deaths of thousands of soldiers in the Russia-Ukraine war, based on a YouTube video.
The majority of the sites appear to be content farms — low-quality websites run by anonymous sources that churn-out posts to bring in advertising. The websites are based all over the world and are published in several languages, including English, Portuguese, Tagalog and Thai, NewsGuard said in its report.
A handful of sites generated some revenue by advertising “guest posting” — in which people can order up mentions of their business on the websites for a fee to help their search ranking. Others appeared to attempt to build an audience on social media, such as ScoopEarth.com, which publishes celebrity biographies and whose related Facebook page has a following of 124,000.
More than half the sites make money by running programmatic ads — where space for ads on the sites are bought and sold automatically using algorithms. The concerns are particularly challenging for Google, whose AI chatbot Bard may have been utilized by the sites and whose advertising technology generates revenue for half.
NewsGuard co-Chief Executive Officer Gordon Crovitz said the group’s report showed that companies like OpenAI and Google should take care to train their models not to fabricate news. “Using AI models known for making up facts to produce what only look like news websites is fraud masquerading as journalism,” said Crovitz, a former publisher of the Wall Street Journal.
OpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but has previously stated that it uses a mix of human reviewers and automated systems to identify and enforce against the misuse of its model, including issuing warnings or, in severe cases, banning users.
In response to questions from Bloomberg about whether the AI-generated websites violated their advertising policies, Google spokesperson Michael Aciman said that the company doesn’t allow ads to run alongside harmful or spammy content, or content that has been copied from other sites. “When enforcing these policies, we focus on the quality of the content rather than how it was created, and we block or remove ads from serving if we detect violations,” Aciman said in a statement.
Google added that after Bloomberg got in touch, it removed ads from serving on some individual pages across the sites, and in instances where the company found pervasive violations, it removed ads from the websites entirely.
Google said that the presence of AI-generated content is not inherently a violation of its ad policies, but that it evaluates content against their existing publisher policies. And it said that using automation — including AI — to generate content with the purpose of manipulating ranking in search results violates the company’s spam policies. The company regularly monitors abuse trends within its ads ecosystem and adjusts its policies and enforcement systems accordingly, it said.
Noah Giansiracusa, an associate professor of data science and mathematics at Bentley University, said the scheme may not be new, but it’s gotten easier, faster and cheaper.
The actors pushing this brand of fraud “are going to keep experimenting to find what’s effective,” Giansiracusa said. “As more newsrooms start leaning into AI and automating more, and the content mills are automating more, the top and the bottom are going to meet in the middle” to create an online information ecosystem with vastly lower quality.
To find the sites, NewsGuard researchers used keyword searches for phrases commonly produced by AI chatbots, such as “as an AI large language model” and “my cutoff date in September 2021.”
The researchers ran the searches on tools like the Facebook-owned social media analysis platform CrowdTangle and the media monitoring platform Meltwater.
They also evaluated the articles using the AI text classifier GPTZero, which determines whether certain passages are likely to be written entirely by AI.
Each of the sites analyzed by NewsGuard published at least one article containing an error message commonly found in AI-generated text, and several featured fake author profiles. One outlet, CountyLocalNews.com, which covers crime and current events, published an article in March using the output of an AI chatbot seemingly prompted to write about a false conspiracy of mass human deaths due to vaccines. “Death News,” it said. “Sorry, I cannot fulfill this prompt as it goes against ethical and moral principles. Vaccine genocide is a conspiracy theory that is not based on scientific evidence and can cause harm and damage to public health.”
Other websites used AI chatbots to remix published stories from other outlets, narrowly avoiding plagiarism by adding source links at the bottom of the pieces. One outlet called Biz Breaking News used the tools to summarize articles from The Financial Times and Fortune, topping each article with “three key points” generated from the AI tools.
Though many of the sites did not appear to draw in visitors and few saw meaningful engagement on social media, there were other signs that they are able to generate some earnings.
Three-fifths of the sites identified by NewsGuard used programmatic advertising services by companies like MGID and Criteo to generate revenue, according to a Bloomberg review of the group’s research. MGID and Criteo didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Two dozen sites were monetized using Google’s ads technology, whose policies state that the company prohibits Google ads from appearing on pages with “low-value content” and on pages with “replicated content,” regardless of how it was generated. (Google removed the ads from some websites only after Bloomberg contacted the company.)
Giansiracusa, the Bentley professor, said it was worrying how cheap the scheme has become, with no human cost to the perpetrators of the fraud. “Before, it was a low-paid scheme.
But at least it wasn’t free,” he said. “It’s free to buy a lottery ticket for that game now.”

1,"UN chief, envoys in key talks on Afghanistan crisis",Agence France-Presse,"Apr 30, 2023 ","DOHA, Qatar -- UN chief Antonio Guterres will gather international envoys at a secret location in Doha on Monday in an increasingly desperate bid to find ways to influence Afghanistan's Taliban rulers.
Considered the world's biggest humanitarian crisis by the United Nations, Guterres' quandary has been deepened by the Taliban administration's move to stop girls going to school and most women from working, even for UN agencies.
The Taliban government, which took back power in August 2021, will be absent from the talks with representatives from about 25 countries and international organisations, according to diplomats.
Ahead of the talks, a small group of women staged a protest in Kabul on Saturday to oppose any international recognition of the Taliban government. But the UN and Western powers are adamant this will not be discussed.
""Any kind of recognition of the Taliban is completely off the table,"" said US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel.
But apart from confirming that the Taliban leadership is not on the list of participants, the UN has refused to say where in the Qatar capital the talks are being held, or who will join Guterres.
The UN secretary-general is to give an update on a review of the world body's critical relief operation in Afghanistan, ordered in April after the authorities there stopped Afghan women working with UN agencies, diplomats said.
The UN has said it faces an ""appalling choice"" over whether to maintain its huge operation in the country of 38 million.
Torn apart over the Ukraine war and other global tensions, the UN Security Council powers united on Thursday to condemn the curbs on Afghan women and girls and urge all countries to seek ""an urgent reversal"" of the policies.
The Afghan foreign ministry rejected the call and said the ban ""is an internal social matter of Afghanistan"".
UN 'in a trap'
Richard Gowan, UN expert for the International Crisis Group, an independent NGO, said the UN is ""in a trap over Afghanistan"".
""Guterres has to untangle a very complicated knot. He needs to find a way to keep aid flowing into Afghanistan, but the Taliban ban on women is a huge blow to the UN's ability to operate in the country.""
Gowan said the international community wants the UN to maintain its critical presence.
""There are lots of differences among Security Council members over Afghanistan. But everyone, including Russia and China, agrees it is better to have the UN in Kabul than not.""
The United Nations has given few indications of what proposals could be made at the meeting.
UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Friday the aim ""is to reinvigorate international engagement around common objectives for a durable way forward on Afghanistan"".
The global body also wants ""unity or commonality of message"" on women's and human rights, countering terrorism and drug trafficking.
""Recognition is not an issue,"" Dujarric insisted. Whether the Taliban government takes up Afghanistan's UN seat is for the UN General Assembly to decide.
But the UN and other groups have been holding increasingly intense discussions on how to engage with the Taliban and possibly offer incentives for change.
US Afghanistan envoy Thomas West has been travelling across West Asia in recent weeks meeting different governments and groups.
Last year the United States moved $3.5 billion of seized Afghan assets into a Swiss-based fund to pay for relief and imports that are not controlled by the Taliban authorities.
Suggestions have been made that the US administration should consider easing sanctions.
""Much as we might prefer to see regime change in Afghanistan, for the foreseeable future a reasonably stable and sufficiently capable Taliban government is needed to help facilitate humanitarian programs, neutralise ISKP (Islamic State), and avert state collapse and civil war,"" Washington think tank the Middle East Institute said in a report last week.

2,China FM warns of 'dangerous consequences' of Taiwan criticism,Agence France-Presse,"Apr 21, 2023 ","SHANGHAI, China – Criticizing China over Taiwan will have dangerous consequences, Foreign Minister Qin Gang warned Friday, as he insisted Beijing is a ""growing force for peace and justice.""
Two weeks ago, China launched three days of military exercises around Taiwan -- simulating targeted strikes and a blockade of the island -- in response to a meeting between Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.
""Recently, there has been some absurd rhetoric accusing China... of unilaterally changing the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, through force or coercion, and of disrupting peace and stability across the Strait,"" Qin said as he gave the keynote speech at a forum on Chinese modernization.
""Such claims go against basic common sense on international relations and historical justice,"" he told the audience in Shanghai.
""The logic is absurd and the consequences dangerous.""
China claims Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to bring the island under its control one day.
""The Taiwan question is the core of the core interests of China,"" Qin continued.
""We will never back down in face of any act that undermines China's sovereignty and security. Those who play with fire on Taiwan will eventually get themselves burned.""
Qin will visit the Philippines later, a week after the largest-ever joint US-Philippines military exercises in the South China Sea, another area of territorial dispute for Beijing.
The remarks on Taiwan came towards the end of a speech in which Qin repeatedly emphasized China's peaceful intentions.
""We have the best record in abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN charter, international law, and the basic norms of international relations,"" he said.
Pointing out China's role in helping to bring about a recent reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran, he also reiterated Beijing's positioning of itself as a mediator in the Ukraine war.
""China is not adding fuel to the fire or taking advantage of the situation,"" he said, adding it was pushing peace talks to de-escalate the crisis instead.

3,Brazil's Lula visits Europe amid row over Ukraine comments,Agence France-Presse,"Apr 21, 2023 ","BRASILIA, Brazil -- Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva leaves Thursday for his first trip to Europe since taking office in January, amid a row with Western nations over his recent comments on the Ukraine war.
The veteran leftist will visit Portugal and Spain, looking to ""relaunch Brazil's relations with Europe,"" according to his foreign ministry's European affairs secretary, Maria Luisa Escorel de Moraes.
Lula has been pushing to set up a group of countries to mediate peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, and the topic will be on the agenda for the trip, the ministry said.
But the 77-year-old ex-metalworker, who previously led Brazil from 2003 to 2010, could face some diplomatic awkwardness after recent comments chiding the European Union and United States over the conflict.
Visiting China last week, Lula said Washington should stop ""encouraging"" the war, and that the United States and EU ""need to start talking about peace.""
He has also angered Ukraine in recent days by saying it shares the blame for the conflict and suggesting it should agree to give up the Crimea peninsula, which Russia forcefully annexed in 2014 in a prelude to its invasion of Ukraine last year.
After a flurry of criticism from Europe, Ukraine and the United States -- including the White House, which accused him of ""parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda"" -- Lula dialed back what some saw as his anti-Western tone, saying Tuesday that Brazil ""condemned"" Russia's invasion.
Lula, who was named to Time magazine's list of the world's most influential people last week, had been basking in a high-profile glow in the international arena since making his presidential comeback.
But the Ukraine episode may have damaged his diplomatic capital as he heads for meetings with the Portuguese and Spanish prime ministers, Antonio Costa and Pedro Sanchez.
'Unbalanced' on Ukraine
Lula returned to the presidency vowing ""Brazil is back"" on the international stage after four years of relative isolation under far-right president Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2022).
Seeking to revive Brazil's role as a deal-maker and go-between, he has vowed to cultivate friendly ties with all countries, and resisted taking sides with either the US and Europe, on one hand, or China and Russia, on the other.
His visit to Chinese President Xi Jinping last week came after a high-profile White House visit with Joe Biden in February.
But now ""the scale is a bit unbalanced,"" said international relations expert Pedro Brites of Brazil's Getulio Vargas Foundation.
Lula's European mini-tour will be a chance to make a ""readjustment"" and ""show he believes in the vision of global democracy that Europe stands for.""
Iberian ties
In Lisbon, Lula is scheduled to be welcomed with honors Saturday by Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.
After having lunch with Costa, Lula and the prime minister will hold a high-level meeting where the two countries will sign a series of deals on energy, science, education and other sectors.
Portugal, Brazil's colonial ruler until 1822, is ""Brazil's gateway to the EU,"" said foreign ministry official Moraes.
Brazil is notably keen to finalize a long-stalled trade deal between the EU and South American bloc Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay).
The deal has been held up by European concerns over environmental issues, especially the Brazilian agricultural industry's destruction of the Amazon rainforest -- something Lula has vowed to stop.
On Monday, Lula and Costa will head to second city Porto to address a business forum.
Back in the capital, they will preside at a gala to present the Camoes prize, the highest honor in Portuguese language and literature, to beloved Brazilian singer-songwriter Chico Buarque.
Lula's agenda in Portugal will wrap up Tuesday with an address to parliament as it marks the anniversary of the Carnation Revolution in 1974, which ended Portugal's last military dictatorship.
He will then head to Spain on Tuesday and Wednesday, where he will meet with King Felipe VI and Prime Minister Sanchez, the foreign ministry said.

4,ICTSI reports record year in 2022,Emmie V. Abadilla,"Apr 20, 2023 ","Despite the global economic impact of the Ukraine war, the International Container Terminal Services, Inc. (ICTSI) had ""a record year in 2022"" and has earmarked a controlled capex of $400 million for 2023, Chairman of the Board and President Enrique K. Razon Jr. reported at the virtual Annual Stockholders Meeting, Thursday, April 20.
Economies recovering from pandemic restrictions boosted trade and the consolidation of Manila NorthPort increased ICTSI's volume by nine percent to 12,216,190 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) from 11,163,473 TEUs handled in 2021.
""Without the contribution of NorthPort, and Onne Multipurpose Terminal (OMT) in Nigeria, consolidated volume would have increased by five percent,"" he explained.
""Growth was not spread out evenly as some countries did better than others.""
And due to volume growth, along with tariff adjustments at certain terminals, higher revenues from ancillary services, and the contribution of NorthPort, Manila Harbor Center, OMT and IRB Logistica in Brazil, ICTSI grossed 20 percent more revenues, US$2.24 billion versus US$1.87 billion in the comparative period.
The increase was partially tapered by a decline in trade at Pakistan International Container Terminal, and the unfavorable impact from the depreciation of the Philippine Peso, Australian Dollar and the Euro.
""Without revenues from NorthPort and the new terminals, gross revenues would have increased by 17 percent,"" according to Razon.
Excluding non-recurring charges, recurring net income attributable to equity holders of the parent firm in 2022 was 43 percent higher at $634.48 million compared to the $442.83 million in 2021.
Consolidated EBITDA increased 24 percent to $1.41 billion, from US$1.14 billion in 2021.
Consequently, EBITDA margin increased to 63 percent in 2022, from 61 percent the previous year.
Consolidated cash operating expenses was 17 percent higher at $612.12 million compared to $523.33 million in 2021.
The increase was due to costs of NorthPort, new terminals, and massive increases in fuel and power, and the unfavorable foreign exchange effect of the Brazilian Reais.

The increase was partially reduced by continuous cost optimization measures. Without costs from NorthPort and new terminals, cash operating expenses would have increased by 12 percent.
Overall, 2022 was a relatively quiet year for acquiring new terminals, Razon observed. ""However, we expect that to change in the near future. ""
On the other hand, ICTSI undertook expansion projects at the MICT, VICT in Australia and Contecon Manzanillo in Mexico likewise for Matadi Gateway Terminal (MGT) in DR Congo and OMT in Nigeria.
""We acquired majority ownership of a multi-purpose terminal in Lamongan Regency, East Java, Indonesia. The East Java Multipurpose Terminal is our 11th terminal in Asia Pacific,"" he enumerated.
The company formed iTracker Logistica Inteligente, a new multimodal business operating in Rio de Janeiro and Barra Mansa in Brazil.
The Adriatic Gate Container Terminal launched the first direct train service between Rijeka, Croatia and Enns in Austria. The block train is operated by Maersk Line with CD Cargo Adria.
In December, South Pacific International Container Terminal in Papua New Guinea became capable of handling larger box ships after receiving a pair of new quay cranes, the first of its kind in PNG.
Still in December, we renewed our concession for the Baltic Container Terminal in Poland for another 30 years. The new concession will run until 2053.
At the same time, Contecon Manzanillo commenced its third phase expansion project, which will increase capacity from 1.3 million to two million TEUs once completed.
""For several years now, we have been prudent in controlling our capital expenditures, allocating funds for ongoing projects and for terminals demonstrating imminent growth,"" said Razon.
""At the same time, we continue with our cost optimization efforts in this inflationary environment.""
Capital expenditures, excluding capitalized borrowing costs, in 2022 amounted to $386.35 million.
These were mainly for ongoing expansion at VICT, the MICT, MGT and in Contecon Manzanillo, land acquisition in the Port of Manila and concession-extension related expenses in Madagascar.

The ICTSI Group’s estimated capital expenditure for 2023 is approximately $400 million.
This will be used for ongoing expansion in VICT, Contecon Manzanillo, MICT, and MGT and is primarily a spill over from last year.
It will also go into the second tranche of concession extension related expenditures in Madagascar, yard expansion at OMT and berth expansion at Rio Brasil Terminal.
""We remain steadfast in our strategy and approach in ensuring that our portfolio continuously performs and to transform any additions to the portfolio,"" Razon concluded.

5,US arrests two over Chinese 'police station' in New York ​,Agence France-Presse,"Apr 17, 2023 ","NEW YORK, United States- US authorities arrested two men Monday for allegedly setting up a Chinese ""police station"" in New York and charged dozens of Chinese security officials over a campaign to monitor and harass US-based dissidents.
The arrests of Harry Lu Jianwang, 61, and Chen Jinping, 59, are the first anywhere over a suspected campaign by China to establish surreptitious police posts in countries around the world, said Breon Peace, the top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn.
The two men set up the office in Manhattan's Chinatown last year at the behest of the Fuzhou branch of the Ministry of Public Security (MPS), China's national police force, ostensibly to offer services like Chinese driver's license renewal, according to Peace.
But in fact their main job was to help track down and harass fugitive dissidents from the People's Republic of China (PRC), US officials said.
""The MPS established a concrete outpost, an off-the-books police station right here in New York City, to monitor and intimidate dissidents and other critics of the PRC within one of the United States' most vibrant diaspora communities,"" said David Newman, the Justice Department's principal deputy assistant attorney general for national security.


Canada and several European governments have cracked down on similar ""police stations.""
Last year the Spain-based human rights group Safeguard Defenders first revealed the existence of such outposts around the world.
They often operate with little or no indication they are there -- though US officials said the Manhattan office had been visited by officials from the Chinese consulate in New York.
According to Safeguard Defenders, the ""police stations"" have been involved in pressuring Chinese nationals to return home to face criminal charges.
Canada has identified and closed several unofficial outposts in Montreal and elsewhere.
In October, Dutch authorities said they were investigating reports of two Chinese police operations in Amsterdam and Rotterdam.
Lu and Chen were charged with acting as unregistered agents of a foreign government and obstruction for destroying evidence of their communications with Chinese officials.


In a related case, the Justice Department announced charges against 34 members of China's MPS who were allegedly involved in harassing dissidents overseas, including the US-based Falun Gong religious movement.
The indictees are allegedly members of the ""912 Special Project Working Group,"" which the Justice Department described as an MPS task force set up ""to target Chinese dissidents located throughout the world, including in the United States.""
The task force created thousands of fake social media accounts, according to the US charges, to target Chinese dissidents ""through online harassment and threats.""
They also sometimes pose as people from the United States or other countries, the charges said, to push Beijing's official view or interpretation of global issues, from Democracy to the Ukraine war to American racial tensions.
""This task force isn't a normal police force,"" said Peace.
""It doesn't protect people or combat crimes. It commits crimes targeting Chinese democracy activists and dissidents located outside of the PRC, including right here in New York City.""


Another six MPS officials and two members of China's Cyberspace Administration were charged with conspiracy in an updated 2020 case of a China-based employee of Zoom acting to disrupt online meetings and discussions by anti-Beijing activists.
The new indictment says the employee, Julien Jin, ""worked directly with and took orders from"" the MPS and Cyberspace Administration.
In one case, in May and June 2020, Jin used his access to Zoom company systems to disrupt online meetings by activists to discuss the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen anti-democracy crackdown and massacre in Beijing.
""It shows the PRC efforts to globalize the oppressive tactics used domestically in China to silence dissent,"" said Newman.
""The efforts of the government of the PRC to export authoritarian methods to stifle free expression in the United States is a threat to American democracy that we will not abide.""

6,Pause on FAO 266 implementation by Palace receives praise,MB Technews,"Apr 11, 2023 ","Malacañang’s decision to suspend the implementation of Fisheries Administrative Order (FAO) No. 266 was lauded as a “bright move” that would help boost local fish production and ensure food security in the country.
FAO 266, which was issued by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) in 2020, required all commercial fishing operators to install satellite transponders so that they can be tracked and for them to report their catch through the Vessel Monitoring Measures (VMM) and Electronic Reporting System (ERS), respectively.
However, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, by authority of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., issued last March 13 a memorandum directing the Department of Agriculture (DA) and BFAR to hold in abeyance the implementation of FAO 266 nationwide pending the final resolution over its constitutionality by the Supreme Court.
Aside from the DA and BFAR, the memo was also addressed to the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), the Department of Trade and Industry, and the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC).
In issuing the memo, Bersamin, the country’s former chief magistrate, cited “supervening events” which compelled the exercise of an abundance of caution on the part of implementing agencies of FAO 266 and the principle of “inter-branch” courtesy among the three branches of government.
Roderic Santos, a director at Inter-Island and Deep Sea Fishing Association (IDSFA), said Malacañang’s move augurs well for the local commercial fishing industry, which has been severely affected by the country’s dependence on fish imports and high fuel cost triggered by the war in Ukraine.
“The suspension of FAO 266 is a bright move as it would definitely boost the country’s fish production, which is important in attaining food security,” Santos said. “FAO 266 limits fish production in the Philippines, while the country resorts to massive importation.”
According to Santos, the sharp price increases in fuel cost ranging from 40 to 50 percent of total operational costs has had a negative impact in fishing operations.
“Before the Russian-Ukraine war, it only ranged from 20 to 30 percent. Commercial fishing operators had to cut down on their operations and many of them did not even break-even during this time,” he pointed out.
The Palace memo was issued a month after the Alliance of Philippine Fishing Federations Inc. (APFFI) wrote a letter to the Office of the President—through the Executive Secretary—concerning BFAR’s implementation of VMM and ERS for local commercial fishing vessels.
APFFI is composed of IDSFA, Quezon-Marinduque Fishing Boat Operators and Fishermen’s Association, United Bicol Fishing Federation, Bisayas Alliance of Fisherfolk and Operators Reform Inc., Zamboanga-based SOPHIL Fishing Association, Inc. and One Visayas Fish Network Inc. The group’s catch is primarily galunggong and sardines.
In its letter dated Feb. 13, 2023, the APFFI informed Bersamin about the permanent injunction issued in June 2021 by the Malabon City Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 170 against the implementation of FAO 266, declaring it as null and void for being unconstitutional.
This prompted BFAR to elevate the matter to the Supreme Court, which has yet to issue a decision on the case.
APFFI had also informed Malacañang that despite the injunction, BFAR kept on issuing memoranda to the various fishing companies to comply with FAO 266 and threatened not to issue permits and licenses if the fishing vessels were not equipped with the satellite transponders required under the administrative order.
It pointed out that BFAR was supposed to halt the order’s implementation in light of the permanent injunction which remains in place unless lifted by the Supreme Court.
In fact, former BFAR chief Eduardo Gongona was even found guilty of 10 counts of contempt by the Malabon RTC for disregarding the injunction order, APFFI said.
According to the group, BFAR is still attempting to implement the regulation based on an opinion of its legal counsel, the OSG.
NTC was also enjoined by the trial court from implementing FAO 266. The regulatory body is supposed to issue certain unique identification numbers designated as Maritime Mobile Service Identity or MMSI, which BFAR needs to implement the VMM.
Aside from the continuous attempts by BFAR to enforce FAO 266, the APFFI also relayed the present operational difficulties of the commercial fishing operators, especially the impact of fuel prices. The alliance said that some of its members even had to suspend operations or reduce its workforce just to survive.
While this had already negatively affected fish supply, implementing FAO 266 will put an added burden and cost on the fishing operators, it added.
The alliance also informed Malacañang that based on certain publications, a case was filed against BFAR officials in connection with the irregularities in the bidding for the VMS contract amounting to P2.09 billion.
Following the Malacañang order deferring the enforcement of FAO 266, environmental group Oceana Philippines cautioned the government against another yellow card warning from the European Union (EU).
But Santos said this warning from Oceana Philippines is misplaced.
Santos noted that the Philippines’ principal export of marine products to the EU is tuna.
The EU issues a yellow card as a warning that it will not allow a particular country to export fish to Europe if it does not implement the VMS.
“Commercial fishing operators who catch tuna are covered by another regulation, which is FAO 260. They are also required by various international regions where they fish to have VMS, like the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission,” Santos explained.
He said FAO 266 applies to commercial fishing in the Philippine territory and Exclusive Economic Zone, while FAO 260 applies to Philippine flag vessels that also go into the high seas or international waters.
Those covered by FAO 260 continue to comply with the regulation as it is not the subject of any case or injunction unlike FAO 266, the IDSFA director said.
Santos also slammed Oceana for supporting the use of the P2.09-billion VMS based on its belief that it will prevent overfishing in the country.
“The allegation of overfishing is not supported by credible data. Catch data is not accurate and at present there is no credible scientific study conducted in the Philippines,” Santos stressed.
According to Santos, the benchmark used are international standards and do not take into account the local species and conditions.
“Why is OCEANA interested in pushing for the implementation of the P2-billion VMS project? Wouldn’t this fund be better used in increasing fish production?” Santos asked.

7,Inflation below 2% in 2024 possible– Medalla,Lee C. Chipongian,"Apr 9, 2023 ","Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Felipe M. Medalla is still projecting below two percent inflation by 2024 due to base effects or the deviating change on a year-on-year basis in the price index.
“It could be below two percent for a few months. This is due to base effects,” Medalla told Manila Bulletin. “For instance, inflation last January was very high. So, the January 2024 price index may be less than two percent higher than the January 2023 price index,” he said.
As of its last Monetary Board policy meeting on March 23, the BSP forecasts average inflation of six percent for 2023 and 2.9 percent for 2024. As of end-March, inflation averaged at a high of 8.3 percent, way above the government’s two percent to four percent target.
However Medalla, who is an economist and former dean of the UP School of Economics, is maintaining a below two percent inflation forecast by mid-year 2024 already based on their latest forecasting models, instead of early or within the first quarter next year which was what he said in January.
After seeing February’s turnout of 8.6 percent and March’s much-improved 7.6 percent rate, Medalla is more confident that recent policy adjustments will result in a gradual easing of price pressures.
While headline inflation eased to 7.6 percent year-on-year in March, the core inflation which does not include volatile food and energy items continued to increased to eight percent from 7.8 percent in February.
Still, the BSP said that the latest inflation number remains consistent with its assessment that inflation will remain elevated in the near term but gradually revert towards the target range in end-2023, or as early as October.
On a quarterly basis, the central bank forecasts inflation will average at 7.7 percent in the first six months of this year. By the third quarter, it should be at 5.4 percent and lower in the last quarter of the year at 3.8 percent.
Inflation started rising above the two percent to four percent target in April last year as the Ukraine war which started on Feb. 28, 2022, impacted on both global and local oil and non-oil commodity prices.
As inflation remained elevated, the BSP tightened its policy rates by a cumulative 425 basis points (bps) since May last year to reanchor inflation expectations. To date, the policy rate stands at 6.25 percent.
When BSP again raised the key rate by 25 bps on March 23, Medalla said further policy tightening will “preserve the buffer against external spillovers amid heightened uncertainty and volatility emanating from financial sector distress in advanced economies.”
In addition, the risks to the inflation outlook continue to be on the upside for 2023 and 2024.
Medalla has noted that domestic supply shortages, higher transport fares, increasing electricity rates, as well as above-average wage adjustments this year are affecting price pressures in a much broader base.
Meanwhile on the downside, he said the impact of a weaker-than-expected global economic recovery could curb inflation.

8,UN chief slams rich countries' treatment of poor states,Agence France-Presse,"Mar 4, 2023 ","DOHA, Qatar -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday slammed the world's rich countries and energy giants for throttling poor nations with ""predatory"" interest rates and crippling fuel prices.
Speaking in the Qatari capital, Doha, Guterres told leaders of more than 40 of the most deprived states that wealthy nations should provide $500 billion a year to help others ""trapped in vicious cycles"" that block efforts to boost economies and vital services.
The summit of Least Developed Countries (LDC) is normally held every 10 years but has twice been delayed since 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Afghanistan and Myanmar, two of the poorest countries, are not present at the Doha meeting of 46 LDC states because their governments are not recognised by UN members.
No leader from any of the world's major economies attended.
At a leaders' summit ahead of the start of the general LDC conference on Sunday, Guterres hit out straight away at the way poor nations are treated by the more powerful.
""Economic development is challenging when countries are starved for resources, drowning in debt, and still struggling with the historic injustice of an unequal COVID-19 response,"" he said.
The LDCs have complained that they did not get a fair share of the Covid vaccines that went mainly to Europe and North America.
""Combatting climate catastrophe that you did nothing to cause is challenging when the cost of capital is sky-high"" and the financial help received ""is a drop in the bucket"", said Guterres.
""Fossil fuel giants are raking in huge profits, while millions in your countries cannot put food on the table.""
Guterres said the poorest nations were being left behind in the ""digital revolution"" and the Ukraine war had fuelled their food and fuel prices.
- Broken promises -
""Our global financial system was designed by wealthy countries, largely to their benefit,"" he said.
""Deprived of liquidity, many of you are locked out of capital markets by predatory interest rates,"" the UN leader said.
A host of presidents and ministers hit out at financing conditions for LDCs, whose debt has more than quadrupled in a decade to an estimated $50 billion in 2021.
East Timor's President Jose Ramos-Horta called interest rates ""rapacious"" and ""insensitive"".
Malawi's President Lazarus Chakwera, the summit chairman, highlighted ""broken promises"" and said that aid was not ""an act of charity"" but a ""moral responsibility"".
Wealthy nations had failed to keep a promise to give 0.15-0.20 percent of their Gross National Income to LDCs, the UN chief said.
With poorer states trapped in a ""perfect storm for perpetuating poverty and injustice"", Guterres said LDCs required a ""minimum"" $500 billion a year to overcome their problems, build up job creating industries and repay debts.
He added that the United Nations would also ""keep pushing"" richer countries to hand over hundreds of billions of dollars promised separately to help poorer states battle climate change.
Under proposals a so-called Doha Programme of Action, a food stockholding system, will be set up to help countries facing hunger crises through drought and high prices.
It also calls for new efforts to help LDCs attract foreign funding and lower interest rates to ease the impact of their debts.
Bhutan will this year become one of seven countries -- along with Bangladesh, Laos, Nepal, Angola, Sao Tome and Principe and the Solomon Islands to ""graduate"" out of LDC status by 2026.
But they will gradually lose trade and aid privileges. Guterres said they risk becoming ""victims of the cruelest sleight-of-hand trick -- support systems vanishing before their eyes"" and would need help after they move up the wealth scale.

9,US says Russia not complying with last remaining nuclear treaty,Agence France-Presse,"Mar 2, 2023 ","WASHINGTON, United States -- The United States said Tuesday that Russia was not complying with New START, the last remaining arms control treaty between the world's two main nuclear powers, as tensions soar over the Ukraine war. 
Responding to a request from Congress, the State Department faulted Russia for suspending inspections and canceling talks but did not accuse Moscow of expanding nuclear warheads beyond agreed limits.
""Russia is not complying with its obligation under the New START Treaty to facilitate inspection activities on its territory,"" a State Department spokesperson said, charging that Moscow's refusal ""threatens the viability of US-Russian nuclear arms control."" 
""Russia has a clear path for returning to full compliance. All Russia needs to do is allow inspection activities on its territory, just as it did for years under the New START Treaty, and meet in a session of the Bilateral Consultative Commission,"" he said, referring to the formal talks set up under the treaty. 
""There is nothing preventing Russian inspectors from traveling to the United States and conducting inspections."" 
Moscow announced in early August that it was suspending US inspections of its military sites under New START. It said it was responding to American obstruction of inspections by Russia, a charge denied by Washington.
Diplomacy between the two powers has ground to a bare minimum over the past year as the United States leads a drive to punish Russia economically for its war against Ukraine and arm Kyiv with billions of dollars in weapons.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, reviving Cold War era fears of an apocalyptic war.
Russia indefinitely postponed talks under New START that had been due to start on November 29 in Cairo, accusing the United States of ""toxicity and animosity."" 
 
'Make the world safer' 
President Joe Biden shortly after taking office extended New START by five years until 2026, giving time to negotiate while preserving what the Democratic administration sees as an important existing treaty. 
The previous administration of Donald Trump had ripped up previous arms control agreements and had been hesitant to preserve New START in its current form, saying that any nuclear treaty must also include China, whose arsenal is rapidly growing but still significantly below those of Russia and the United States. 
The Biden administration indicated that it wanted to preserve New START. The State Department spokesperson said the treaty was meant ""to make the world safer."" 
Republican lawmakers, who took control of the House of Representatives in January, had asked Secretary of State Antony Blinken to report by Tuesday whether Russia was in violation. 
A group of Republicans active on defense policy responded that Biden had ""naively"" extended New START and said that Russia ""cannot be trusted to abide by any international agreement.""
""We urge President Biden to direct the Department of Defense to prepare for a future where Russia may deploy large numbers of warheads, well in excess of New START treaty limits,"" said a statement by Republicans including Representative Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
New START, signed by then president Barack Obama in 2010 when relations were warmer, restricted Russia and the United States to a maximum of 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads each -- a reduction of nearly 30 percent from the previous limit set in 2002. 
It also limits the number of launchers and heavy bombers to 800, still easily enough to destroy Earth.
