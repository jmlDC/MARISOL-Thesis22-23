DICT chief laments Pinoys ‘bad habit’ as SIM registration is extended,1.0
"Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Secretary Ivan John Uy on Tuesday, April 25, denied that low turnout was the reason for the extension of the SIM registration as he lamented the “bad habit” of Filipinos when  to doing things “at the last minute.”",12.0
"During a Palace briefing after his meeting with President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., the official said that “low turnout was not the main reason for extension” since there were already 82 million SIM registrations out of 168,016,400 total number of active SIMs in the Philippines.",14.0
"“Clearly, matitigas lang talaga ang ulo ng ating mga kababayan (our fellowmen are just hard-headed). They were always hoping for extension,” Uy lamented.",10.0
"“We should start being more responsible  When we say deadline, it is really a deadline,” he added.",6.0
The DICT chief said this after reporting that there was a “surge in the registration” in the last two weeks before the original April 26 deadline.,2.0
"According to Uy, there were only an average of 100,000 SIM card registrants during the first few months of the registration period.",2.0
"“That goes to show the issue is not really limited ID or anything. It is just our bad habit of delaying to the last minute,  (with) the law,” he stressed as the country’s major telcos claimed lack of valid IDs and digital literacy as obstacles to registration.",6.0
"Meanwhile, Uy also bared plans to concentrate on provinces and islands with low registration turnout.",12.0
"Among these island provinces, he noted, were Dinagat Islands, Camiguin, Siquijor, Tawi-Tawi, and Basilan.",14.0
The official said that residents of far-flung provinces should have no problem registering their SIMs because “our system is allowing even barangay-issued IDs so (the) barangay is already the lowest government agency” that is “fully accessible” to all residents.,6.0
"“In the next 90 days, we will be concentrating on some of those islands and some of  where we will be deploying more people and more resources to those islands for registration,” he shared.",8.0
"A day before the April 26 deadline, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla announced that the deadline has been extended by 90 days, giving active SIM users three more months to have their numbers registered.",5.0
"Uy said there would be an estimated 15 to 18 million, or as much as 20 million, SIM cards that would be registered during the extension.",1.0
"He expects total SIM registrations to be around 100 million since the remaining 50 million are disposable ones used for “different purposes,” such as telemarketing and scamming.",7.0

"President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.  to extend the SIM card registration period to 90 more days as he recognized that the remaining unregistered SIM cards are still a significant number.",13.0
Department of Information and Communications Technology Secretary Ivan John Uy said it was actually not the low turnout of registrants that prompted the President to approve the 90-day extension.,13.0
"He said Marcos believes the remaining unregistered SIM cards, which are estimated to be around 20 million, are still a significant number that warrants an extension.",8.0
"""Actually it's not the low turnout. We are already at 82 million and as I said earlier, the 168 million original number is not an accurate number in terms of legitimate SIM card users. The expected number would be about a hundred million more or less, maybe a 110 million on a hindsight. So with that number at 82 million, we are about 80 percent registered,"" Uy explained.",12.0
"""So, when you're talking about 70 percent of all SIM cards issued being legitimate SIM card users, sa 168 million natin mga nasa (of 168 million there are only) 100 to 110 million, so we are expecting maybe about 20 million pa ang hindi nakapagrehistro (unregistered) and that's still a significant number. So the President has decided to allow the extension of 90 days,"" Uy added.",2.0
Another reason that prompted Marcos to extend the registration deadline is the data showing that most of the unregistered SIM cards were from far-flung areas and provincial islands.,8.0
"""When the statistics came in, when we're looking at the low turnout, we discovered that some of the low turnouts were in the island provinces,"" Uy said.",12.0
