Blended learning being implemented by some schools amid extreme heat --- DepEd,10.0
"The Department of Education (DepEd) on Wednesday, April 26, said that blended learning is already being implemented in some schools to address the concerns of learners, teachers, and parents regarding the conduct of in-person classes during the dry season.",
"“Some schools are already implemented blended learning,” DepEd Spokesman Michael Poa told the Manila Bulletin in a Viber message.",
"“Classes are held at certain times of the day when it’s not too hot but supplemented by ADMs [Alternative Delivery Modes],” he added.",
"On April 20, DepEd issued a reminder to schools that they are allowed to suspend classes and implement modular distance learning in consideration of the “well-being of the learners affected by extreme climate conditions as they attend in-person classes.”",
"The agency also reiterated that the DepEd Order No. 037 s. of 2022 or the “Guidelines on the Cancellation or Suspension of Classes and Work in Schools in the Event of Natural Disasters, Power Outages/Power Interruptions, and Other Calamities,” provides for the implementation of modular distance learning “in the event of canceled or suspended classes due to natural disasters, calamities, and human-induced hazards to ensure learning continuity and that  and objectives are met.”",
"Asked how many schools have temporarily shifted to blended learning since the DepEd memo was issued, Poa said that field offices are “currently collating” the initial data.",
Shortened class hours,
"Meanwhile, Poa reiterated that DepEd regional offices have already issued their respective advisories on matters related to the conduct of in-person classes during hot weather.",
"Last week, the Teachers’ Dignity Coalition (TDC) urged DepEd to consider shorter class hours or class days instead of implementing modular distance learning which is “not effective.”",
"“The pure modular has been proven ineffective, that's why we have learning gaps now,” said TDC National Chairperson Benjo Basas said in a mix of English and Filipino.",
"Instead of shifting to pure modular learning, TDC said that shorter periods of face-to-face classes would be more effective.",
"As a response, Poa noted that “simply shortening classes will also not be effective for learning, especially since we are on learning recovery right now.”",
"To address the problem of extreme heat in schools, TDC said that DepEd should focus on long-term solutions.",
"For TDC, the long-term solutions include reducing the number of students per class to avoid overcrowding, building more classrooms, and hiring more teachers.",
Basas noted that providing proper ventilation like installing enough electric fans or air conditioning systems in schools would also be crucial in addressing the problem.,
"Poa, in a Viber message to reporters on April 24, noted that while schools have Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE), this will not be enough to put up air conditioning systems in all classrooms.",
"“Kaya po mariin naming pinapaalalahan ang ating mga school heads na kung hindi na po conducive ang learning environment sa mga paaralan nang dahil sa init ng panahon maari po silang mag suspinde ng in-person at mag-implement ng ADMs (That's why we strongly remind our school heads that if the learning environment in schools is no longer conducive due to the heat of the weather, they can suspend in-person and implement ADMs),” Poa added.",
