"“Kaya po mariin naming pinapaalalahan ang ating mga school heads na kung hindi na po conducive ang learning environment sa mga paaralan nang dahil sa init ng panahon, maari po silang mag suspinde ng in-person at mag-implement ng ADMs (That’s why we are strongly reminding our school heads that if the learning environment is no longer conducive due to heat, they can suspend in-person classes and implement ADMs),” he said.",9.0

"The Federation of Parents-Teachers Association earlier said the DepEd must consider putting up air conditioners in all classrooms instead of resorting to ADMs or reverting to the former school calendar when school breaks are effective every April to May.  The DepEd maintained its position to study and assess the possible reverting of school breaks to the summer season following calls from groups and legislators, especially after incidents of heat exhaustion in some schools.  Last March 23, some 83 learners out of 2,121 participating learners in an unannounced fire drill in a school in Cabuyao, Laguna were hospitalized amid unbearable heat.  On the following day, another 32 learners of the same school were brought to the hospital after experiencing dizziness in the middle of the class.  Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration’s (PAGASA) forecast heat index shows that several areas in the country shall be at “extreme caution” levels, with others set at “danger” levels, from Monday to Friday this week.
