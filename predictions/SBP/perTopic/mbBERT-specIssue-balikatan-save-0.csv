"Now what’s next? Cope Thunder – Philippines 23-1, that’s what.",
"For the first time after three decades, the Philippine Air Force (PAF) and the United States Air Force (USAF) will revive the Cope Thunder exercises with primary flight operations over Clark Air Force Base in Pampanga. ",
"The Cope Thunder – Philippines 23-1 will take place from May 1 to 12, according to the US Pacific Air Forces Public Affairs.",
"Cope Thunder began in the Philippines in 1976 but it had to be stopped after the closure of military bases in Clark and Subic Bay in 1991. The following year, it was moved to the Eielson Air Force Base where it was renamed Red Flag Alaska.",
"“This is the first iteration of Cope Thunder in the Philippines since 1990. It provides a unique opportunity to integrate forces and improve interoperability between the Philippines and the United States,” the US Pacific Air Forces Public Affairs said.",

"AFP, US counterpart's live fire drill a success as mock vessel sinks off Zambales",
"The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the United States Armed Forces declared as successful the conduct of  joint littoral live fire exercise in San Antonio, Zambales on Wednesday, April 26, when it achieved its objective to sink a mock vessel.",
"Col. Michael Logico, executive agent for the Philippine side of the Exercise Balikatan 2023, said BRP Pangasinan (PS-31) sank at 2:55 p.m. when an F-35B Joint Strike Fighters aircraft of the US delivered a laser-guided bomb to it.",
"BRP Pangasinan, a World War II-era corvette, represented an enemy force approaching the Philippine territory by sea during the exercise. The vessel was  by the Philippine Navy in 2021.",
"“It will not be fair to give all the credit to the US Air Force because a lot of the other aircraft and navy ships also contributed to the sinking of BRP Pangasinan. But what delivered the final salvo was the F-35,” Logico said.",
He said that the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) that were fired by the troops during the earlier part of the drill did not hit the target. These rockets were supposed to sink the vessel.,
"“Even before the exercise, we were also not sure if the HIMARS will hit since it is a ground-based and area weapon, not a precision weapon,” Logico said.",
"Aside from this, several other concerns have to be considered such as the location of BRP Pangasinan.",
"“The ex-PS31 was not anchored because it is too deep: 6,000 feet. So it was drifting,” he said.",
"The officer also mentioned that there were two intruders which delayed the exercise, and not one as earlier reported. One was an aerial interloper which was a private unregistered single craft aircraft that flew in the middle of the ocean near the operational area while the other one was a boat. ",
"“This resulted to the delay since they [troops] have to  [the location] and because of the drift, they found it hard to hit PS-31,” he said. ",
AFP says PH has right to hold drills within territory as 'intruder' delays Balikatan main event,
The Philippines has an “inherent and invaluable” right to conduct military exercises within its own territory.,
"(HIMARS rockets are fired during  joint littoral live fire exercise of Exercise Balikatan 2023 in San Antonio, Zambales on April 26, 2023. Photo by Noel Pabalate / MANILA BULLETIN)",
"This was stressed by Colonel Michael Logico, executive agent for the Philippine side of the Exercise Balikatan 2023, after the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the United States Armed Forces conducted  joint littoral live fire exercise in San Antonio, Zambales on Wednesday, April 26, which served as the main event of this year's Balikatan.",
"“We are exercising inside of our territorial waters and inside of our territorial airspace and that is our inherent and invaluable right to exercise within our territory,” Logico told reporters after the live fire drill. ",
"The exercise was highlighted by the sinking of former Philippine Navy corvette BRP Pangasinan (PS-31) at 12 nautical miles from the shoreline through the firing of rockets, artilleries, and other aviation weapons. ",
The location of the ship is well within the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Philippines. The exercise was also held at approximately 100 nautical miles from Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal which was seized by China from the Philippines in a tense standoff in 2012.,
"Logico said he would not want to anticipate China’s reaction to the AFP and US military’s joint drills near the Scarborough Shoal. “I cannot speak for them (China),” he said.",
But the Balikatan main event was marked by a surprising delay when the radars of the AFP and US military detected an aerial intruder flying within the operational area where the sinking exercise was being held. The interloper was later identified as a “a private unregistered single craft aircraft.”,
Logico said they had to delay the firing of the rockets to sink BRP Pangasinan since it could pose danger to the interloper.,
"“Safety is always a primary consideration when we conduct the exercise. Any interloper or any intrusion into the exercise that will endanger the lives of people, whether its intentional or accidental, is our primary consideration. As a general SOP [standard operating procedure] we lift fires every time that there is an interloper to our territory,” he said.",
It has yet to be determined whether the aircraft got inside the operational area by mere accident or intentionally as a form of sabotage.,
"“We are not sure if it was intentional or accidental so I will not need to jump for a conclusion,” Logico said.",
"Meanwhile, Col. Jackson Doan, from the US Marine Corps Forces Pacific, said the live fire exercise was meant to develop the interoperability of the forces from the Philippines and US militaries so they can work together in future scenarios.",
"“The message is not geared toward anything outside of the strong relationship and bond with the Philippines. The message is very simple,” Doan said.",
"“We’ve been called upon to train together and we learn from that. That key element of partnership and resolve is far stronger than any other measures and technical prowess, any other measure of exploding targets or any other measure of offensive and defensive capability,” he continued.",
"“The resolve in partnership is far stronger than any technical element that we have and that’s the true message of Balikatan, in translation shoulder to shoulder. That doesn’t mean weapon to weapon. It really means family,” he added.",

Stephen Parreño among others.",
"The sinking exercise began around 9 a.m. when the US Armed Forces fired the first round of volley of its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which contained six rocket fires. HIMARS, an American rocket system, has been in service since 2010. It is currently being employed in the Ukrainian war and has seen service in the Afghanistan War, Syrian Civil War, and Iraq War.",
"The rocket fires were aimed at BRP Pangasinan, which was positioned at 12 nautical miles from the shoreline of San Antonio, near the West Philippine Sea (WPS). The former Philippine Navy corvette, which was  in 2021, represented an enemy force approaching the Philippine territory by sea.",
"The location of the ship was monitored by Hermes 900, a drone used for intelligence gathering, and other redundant sensors which transmitted the information to  intelligence fusion effects center (CIFEC) at Camp Aquino in Tarlac. The intelligence center provided  operational picture of the entire area and coordination between the different firing units are processed in that particular location. The orders were also handed to the firing units through the CIFEC.",
"Simulating a real-world scenario where troops have to take out an adversary ship, the first rocket fire was aimed at the center mast of BRP Pangasinan to take away  systems while the remaining five shots were supposed to sink it.",
"However, the first shot missed the target since the vessel “is drifting so it was not in the correct location,” a US military personnel announced. The first shot was located at approximately six to nine meters away from the vessel while the five other shots hit different points.",
A second set of HIMARS rockets were then prepared for firing as the CIFEC calculated the new position of BRP Pangasinan. But an aerial interloper was detected by the radars of the AFP and US Armed Forces which delayed the exercise for a few minutes.,

"“The range is cold because of safety issue, because of an aerial interloper that was reported to have entered the opera box [operational box]. We are waiting for the range to clear. The interloper was a private unregistered single craft aircraft in the middle of the ocean,” a US military personnel announced.",
"Prior to the exercise, picket vessels from the Philippine Navy and Philippine Coast Guard were deployed to secure the operational area. These vessels were to enforce the Notice to Mariners issued weeks before the Balikatan to prevent  and local fishing vessel from passing through the operational area.",
"Once the interloper was escorted out of the operational area, the second volley of HIMARS rockets were fired and the exercise went smoothly.",
"(Artillery pieces are fired during  joint littoral live fire exercise in San Antonio, Zambales on April 26, 2023. Photo by Noel Pabalate / MANILA BULLETIN)",
"It was followed by artillery fires from the Philippine Army’s Autonomous Truck Mounted Howitzer System (ATMOS), which are 155 mm self-propelled howitzers, as well as 105mm howitzers from the Philippine Marine Corps, and other US artilleries.",
"The artillery pieces were aimed at a much nearer secondary target called “killer tomato,” which are a bunch of drums tied with a bamboo, located 4.7 nautical miles away from San Antonio town’s shoreline.",
"After the artillery firing, the AFP and US Armed Forces utilized aerial assets in the capability demonstration exercise.",
"Among the assets used by both countries were Boeing AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, FA-50 Golden Eagle fighter attack aircraft, F-16 Fighting Falcons multirole fighter aircraft, F-35B Joint Strike Fighters aircraft, and AC-130 Spectre gunship.",
