"Speaker asks telcos: Reveal total of postpaid subscribers, active but unlisted SIMs",1.0
House Speaker Martin Romualdez is asking the country's  (telcos) to reveal the total number of their postpaid mobile phone subscribers as well as the active but unlisted SIMs that they have sold.,
" data should give us, the public, an idea of how many SIMs, postpaid and prepaid, need to be registered,” Romualdez said in a statement Friday, April 28.",
He added that telcos should filter their data by discarding inactive SIMs.,
"Romualdez asked for these figures just days after President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. extended the SIM registration window for another 90 days.",
"Republic Act (RA) No.11934 or the SIM registration law set the registration period between Dec. 27, 2022 and April 26, 2023.",
SIM cards are used to avail of network services on electronic devices such as mobile phones.,
"Reports said that as of April 23 or three days before the original April 26 registration deadline, only 82.8 million SIM owners have registered.",
"Of the 82.8 million registrants, 39.9 million signed up with Smart Communications, 37.09 million with Globe  and 5.79 million with DITO  Corp.",
There have been reports that the three telcos have sold a total of 165 million to 170 million SIM cards.,
Romualdez says OFW families could be finding SIM registration difficult,
House Speaker Martin Romualdez is worried that families of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) are finding it a challenge to have their subscriber identity module or SIM cards registered.,
"“I suspect that OFW families in the provinces are finding it difficult  with the registration requirement. Some may even be unaware of it,” Romualdez said in a statement Friday, April 28.",
"""Let us assist [OFWs] and their families to register. Their mobile phones are their principal means  and connecting to each other. The thought that they could instantly make audio-video calls eases the pain of being thousands of miles away from home and from their loved ones,” the Leyte 1st district congressman explained.",
"He said the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) and the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) should help the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), National  Commission (NTC) and telcos inform OFWs and their families of the registration requirement.",

SIM cards are used to avail of network services on electronic devices such as mobile phones.,
The Speaker believes that many OFWs and their families back home here in the country are using unlisted prepaid SIMs because of the convenience of acquiring them.,
Romualdez lauded telcos for offering registration assistance and mechanisms for their postpaid and prepaid SIM users to list up.,
"However, he asked them “to go the extra mile in seeking out people who have bought and used their SIMs and help them to register so they would be able to continue using their cellular phone service"".",
"“That is to the benefit of the telcos, financially,” he pointed out.",
"“Let us help millions of Filipinos who have mobile phones, but who still have not registered their SIMs as required by law, to register. Let us make it easier for them to take advantage of the 90-day registration extension granted by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.,” he further said.",
SIM registration fee allowed—DICT,
"Retail outlets charging customers for registering their SIM cards on their behalf are not violating any law, a Cabinet member said.",
"Department of Information and Communications Technology Secretary Ivan John Uy said it is merely a ""private transaction"" between the seller and SIM card user, who opted to get help from an individual in registering the SIM.",
"""Well, actually it’s a private transaction between the SIM card holder and the, and the SIM seller ‘no, retailer ba ito? Mga retailer, nasa palengke, oo (Retailers in the markets, yes). So, it’s a private transaction between them,"" Uy said in a Palace press briefing.",
"He said the SIM card holder is merely ""asking for assistance from an individual"" and it is only proper to pay for their service, especially if the sellers used their own mobile data for registration.",
"He likened the transaction to pay phones in stores, where the caller pays for P5 per call.",
"""Hindi naman siguro lumalabag sa batas na mag-charge sila ng kaunting fee dahil may gastos rin naman sila (I don't think they are violating any law by charging a small fee because they also spent their own resources there),"" Uy said.",
"""And I think 20 pesos is very, very reasonable. And for many na medyo digitally challenged, I think nakakatulong naman iyon (who are digitally challenged, I think this can help them),"" Uy added.",
"The DICT chief said this after President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. approved the proposal to extend the SIM registration period after the April 26 deadline.",
"According to Uy, Marcos  to extend the deadline due to the remaining 20 million unregistered SIM cards and low turnout in island provinces.",

Ranking solon warns Pinoys vs complacency amid extension of SIM registration window,
"Filipinos shouldn't  with President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.'s extension of the SIM registration period for another 90 days.",
"Thus, said House Committee on Appropriations Chairman and Ako Bicol Party-list Rep. Zaldy Co, who  the move of the President.",
"""I requested and suggested only 60 days extension but the President did better by pushing the deadline back by 90 days,"" Co said in a statement Wednesday, April 26, which was the original deadline for SIM registration under Republic Act (RA) No.11934 or the SIM Registration Act.",
"""The 90 days leeway should not mean another excuse for SIM subscribers to wait until the last few days of the extension before they register. SIM subscribers must realize that their SIM phone numbers are means of identification and access to essential services as the country  more digital,"" Co said.",
"""Here at the House of Representatives, led by Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, one of our key concerns is 'disenfranchisement' of the poor and marginalized who have difficulty with SIM registration. We do not want them to be shut out of telco service because of their inherent problems stemming from being poor and marginalized,"" the Bicolano pointed out.",
SIM stands for subscriber identity module. SIM cards are used to avail of network services on electronic devices such as mobile phones.,
"The SIM Registration Act originally set the enlistment window between Dec. 27, 2022 and April 26, 2023. The law provides for an extension of up to 120 days.",
"""Assistance must be given, especially to senior citizens who are unfamiliar with technical matters, persons with disability and persons with special needs who have inherent handicaps making them unable to follow online instructions, and solo parents and working parents who are hard-pressed to set aside hours to fall in line at service desks and kiosks,"" Co said.",
He further noted that the extension gives the telcos  more time to work with the government agencies that have verifiable databases backing the IDs and identification documents they have issued.,
The lack of IDs of some Filipinos has been cited as one of the reason for the low turnout so far in connection with the SIM registration.,

"This, however, is not yet final and is still under discussion, Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Secretary Ivan John Uy said.",
"""So this is the last chance. The law actually has our hands tied. We are only allowed to do this, the extension once and up to a certain period of time. Thereafter, it will be a hard deadline,"" Uy said in a Palace briefing on Tuesday, April 25.",
"He reminded them that those who do not register will lose all services, numbers, access to their SIM card, which means they cannot call out, receive calls and cannot text. They will also lose access to their e-wallets and other financial services linked to their SIM card.",
"""So I urge the public really to register quickly,"" he said.",
The DICT chief said they are exploring options in order to further urge the public to register their SIM cards promptly and not delay it.,
"""We are exploring some options that will be available to us in order to incentivize our public to register. We did not put those conditions in the first SIM card registration. But because of our observation that people are not taking our deadlines seriously, we are now exploring other options to incentivize registration,"" Uy said.",
"By ""incentivizing"", it means that users who fail to register their SIM cards within 90-day period might lose certain services even if the registration period is still ongoing.",
"""Let’s say, after the 60 days, you will lose your access to your Facebook accounts or to your TikTok accounts.

"""And so eventually, once we reach the 90-day, you will  all services to all your SIM cards. So those are still being threshed out by the telcos as to which ones will be easier for them to implement and how do we schedule the gradual reduction of the services. So iyong mga matitigas ang ulo, they wanted some convincing whether we’re serious or not, makakatikim sila nitong mga incentives namin (they will have a taste of this in incentive),"" Uy explained.",
Uy pointed out that the 90-day extension is a reasonable time for everybody to register.,

DICT chief laments Pinoys ‘bad habit’ as SIM registration is extended,
"Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Secretary Ivan John Uy on Tuesday, April 25, denied that low turnout was the reason for the extension of the SIM registration as he lamented the “bad habit” of Filipinos when  to doing things “at the last minute.”",
"During a Palace briefing after his meeting with President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., the official said that “low turnout was not the main reason for extension” since there were already 82 million SIM registrations out of 168,016,400 total number of active SIMs in the Philippines.",
"“Clearly, matitigas lang talaga ang ulo ng ating mga kababayan (our fellowmen are just hard-headed). They were always hoping for extension,” Uy lamented.",
"“We should start being more responsible  When we say deadline, it is really a deadline,” he added.",
The DICT chief said this after reporting that there was a “surge in the registration” in the last two weeks before the original April 26 deadline.,
"According to Uy, there were only an average of 100,000 SIM card registrants during the first few months of the registration period.",
"“That goes to show the issue is not really limited ID or anything. It is just our bad habit of delaying to the last minute,  (with) the law,” he stressed as the country’s major telcos claimed lack of valid IDs and digital literacy as obstacles to registration.",
"Meanwhile, Uy also bared plans to concentrate on provinces and islands with low registration turnout.",
"Among these island provinces, he noted, were Dinagat Islands, Camiguin, Siquijor, Tawi-Tawi, and Basilan.",
The official said that residents of far-flung provinces should have no problem registering their SIMs because “our system is allowing even barangay-issued IDs so (the) barangay is already the lowest government agency” that is “fully accessible” to all residents.,
"“In the next 90 days, we will be concentrating on some of those islands and some of  where we will be deploying more people and more resources to those islands for registration,” he shared.",
"A day before the April 26 deadline, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla announced that the deadline has been extended by 90 days, giving active SIM users three more months to have their numbers registered.",
"Uy said there would be an estimated 15 to 18 million, or as much as 20 million, SIM cards that would be registered during the extension.",
"He expects total SIM registrations to be around 100 million since the remaining 50 million are disposable ones used for “different purposes,” such as telemarketing and scamming.",
"20-M unregistered SIM cards, low turnout in islands prompted PBBM to extend registration",
"President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.  to extend the SIM card registration period to 90 more days as he recognized that the remaining unregistered SIM cards are still a significant number.",
Department of Information and Communications Technology Secretary Ivan John Uy said it was actually not the low turnout of registrants that prompted the President to approve the 90-day extension.,
"He said Marcos believes the remaining unregistered SIM cards, which are estimated to be around 20 million, are still a significant number that warrants an extension.",
"""Actually it's not the low turnout. We are already at 82 million and as I said earlier, the 168 million original number is not an accurate number in terms of legitimate SIM card users. The expected number would be about a hundred million more or less, maybe a 110 million on a hindsight. So with that number at 82 million, we are about 80 percent registered,"" Uy explained.",
"""So, when you're talking about 70 percent of all SIM cards issued being legitimate SIM card users, sa 168 million natin mga nasa (of 168 million there are only) 100 to 110 million, so we are expecting maybe about 20 million pa ang hindi nakapagrehistro (unregistered) and that's still a significant number. So the President has decided to allow the extension of 90 days,"" Uy added.",
Another reason that prompted Marcos to extend the registration deadline is the data showing that most of the unregistered SIM cards were from far-flung areas and provincial islands.,
"""When the statistics came in, when we're looking at the low turnout, we discovered that some of the low turnouts were in the island provinces,"" Uy said.",
"""So with this when it was presented the President noticed that we need to put in more effort to deploy more teams to those island provinces in order to address the low turnout,"" he added.",
"The DICT chief said the daily registrants were only hitting about 100,000 to 200,000 per day but it went back up to one million registrants a day nearing to the supposed April 26 deadline.",
"With the 90-day extension, they are expecting that the remaining unregistered SIM cards pegged at 20 million will be registered as they will not hold back in deactivating all the remaining unregistered SIM cards after the 90 day period.",

"Estrada: Telcos should make SIM registration user-friendly, fuss-free",
"Senator Jinggoy Ejercito Estrada on Tuesday, April 25 said  (telcos) should undertake the necessary steps to make the procedure for the registration of SIM (subscriber identity module) cards easier for prepaid subscribers. ",
Estrada made the call after the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) announced a 90-day extension for the ongoing SIM registration. ,
The senator said it is lamentable that only 49.31 percent of the 168 million subscribers  with the SIM Registration law. ,
"“We’re hoping that in the next 90 days, the 100% target registration will be met,” Estrada said.",
Estrada said one of the biggest reason why a number of people are having a hard  with the requirements of the law is due to the process not being user-friendly for prepaid subscribers. ,
Many  about the lack of internet connection or the inaccessibility of the registration sites which hampers registration.,
"“In the next 90 days, telcos should undertake the necessary actions to make the registration procedure fuss-free. No amount of information dissemination will work if the mobile network carriers will not address the concerns of the general public,” said Estrada, who is also a co-author and co-sponsor of the SIM Registration Act or Republic Act No. 11934. ",
"“Pundits will always have their say against this law but the majority will agree with me that the benefits of registered SIM outweigh the perceived threats or danger to people’s lives and public order,” he said.",
"“From the time RA 11934 was signed into law in October last year, the number of spam and scam text messages received daily by every mobile phone subscriber, myself included, reduced significantly or was almost nil,” the senator also noted.",
Estrada reiterated that the purpose of enacting this law is to deter illegal acts aided by SMS technology and help law enforcers track down the perpetrators.,
"“Only the privacy of criminals will  by the SIM registration law. Wala ng manghahangas na makapanloko sa text dahil mabibisto sila kapag rehistrado ang SIM (No one will dare to fraud through text messages, because they would be caught once their SIM are registered),” he stressed. ",
"Sen. Grace Poe, chairperson of the Senate Committee on Public Services, also  the decision of the DICT to extend the period of SIM registration, which is supposed to end on April 26. ",
Poe also said both the National  Commission (NTC) and the telcos should double the efforts to reach out to more subscribers in rural and remote areas to ensure that “no one is left behind.”,
She also said a “lot more ground needs to be covered” as key areas such as the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) have yet to be reached according to the data by NTC.,
"﻿“It should be all hands on deck in expanding the reach of SIM Registration and in ensuring that no one gets left behind,” Poe said.",
"﻿“DICT, NTC, and telcos must also disseminate the correct information on the law and help clarify the confusion surrounding it. It should be emphasized that SIMs will still be available in local retailers and sari-sari stores even past the SIM Registration deadline. Users will simply be required to register first before they can activate their new SIMs,” she stressed. ",
