"So mas maganda po na ngayon, habang wala pa po ibang mga modifications na yan, or, shall we say, ‘yung tinatawag po na incentives, ay mai-register po ninyo yung SIM po ninyo (So it's better that while there are no other modifications, or, shall we say, the so-called incentives, you can register your SIM),” said Salvahan.",6.0

"You can still use your phone, you can still call, you can still text and then after a certain period, you will lose your outgoing calls so that way, ramdam niyo kung ano effect na di kayo nagpaparehistro,"" he said.",6.0
Uy said they are also exploring available options to incentivize those registering their SIM cards in order for the public to take the deadline more seriously.,6.0
He said the lack of government-issued identification documents or the down times of the registration system are not really the problem that was raised by the  but “it’s just our bad habit of delaying to the last minute.”Uy said IDs issued by barangays are acceptable for SIM registration and  have already upgraded their systems.“This is the last chance.,6.0
