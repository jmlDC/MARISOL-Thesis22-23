NTC: 90-day extension for SIM registration ‘final’,6.0
"AN OFFICIAL from the National  Commission (NTC) said on Wednesday, April 26, 2023, that the 90-day extension for SIM registration is already “final.”“Based on the discussion po, hindi na po.",
"That will be the final extension po, ‘yung 90-day period po na extension,” NTC Deputy Commissioner Jon Paulo Salvahan said, referring to the sectoral meeting led by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. on updates regarding SIM registration on Monday, April 24, in Malacañang.",
Marcos approved the 90-day extension for SIM registration during the meeting.,
"Under the SIM Registration Act, which was signed into law by Marcos in October 2022, the registration deadline could be extended to up to 120 days.",
"Salvahan reminded the subscribers that their SIM cards will automatically be deactivated, which means they will no longer be able to use it for any services either call or text and online transactions, if it will not be registered by July 26.",
"He said the 90 days is enough for subscribers and  to address concerns in SIM registration, such as lack of identification documents, knowledge and even illiteracy.“Please do not wait for the deadline, because within the 90-day period po... we might consider some modifications in the effects of the SIM registration.",
"So mas maganda po na ngayon, habang wala pa po ibang mga modifications na yan, or, shall we say, ‘yung tinatawag po na incentives, ay mai-register po ninyo yung SIM po ninyo (So it's better that while there are no other modifications, or, shall we say, the so-called incentives, you can register your SIM),” said Salvahan.",
"Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Secretary John Ivan Uy earlier said he does not see any more reasons for the public not to register their SIMs in accordance with the law, noting that IDs issued by barangays are acceptable and  have already upgraded their systems.",
"With the 90-day extension, the government expects that around 15 to 18 million more subscribers will register their SIM.",
"So far, over 87 million out of the 168 million active SIM cards in the country were registered.",
A group of petitioners tried but failed to get the Supreme Court’s nod to declare the SIM Registration Act unconstitutional.,
DICT to ‘gradually’ remove services of unregistered SIMs,
THE Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) is looking into “gradually” deactivating some services of unregistered SIM cards during the 90-day registration extension.,
"DICT Secretary Ivan John Uy said they will observe the rate of registration within the extension period and may start deactivating some services on unregistered SIM cards “30 days or 60 days into registration.”""Let's say after 60 days, you will lose your access to your Facebook accounts or your TikTok accounts.",
"You can still use your phone, you can still call, you can still text and then after a certain period, you will lose your outgoing calls so that way, ramdam niyo kung ano effect na di kayo nagpaparehistro,"" he said.",
Uy said they are also exploring available options to incentivize those registering their SIM cards in order for the public to take the deadline more seriously.,
He said the lack of government-issued identification documents or the down times of the registration system are not really the problem that was raised by the  but “it’s just our bad habit of delaying to the last minute.”Uy said IDs issued by barangays are acceptable for SIM registration and  have already upgraded their systems.“This is the last chance.,
The law actually has our hands tied.,
"We are only allowed to do this extension once and up to a certain period of time,” he said.",
"In the next 90 days, Uy said they will be concentrating on having subscribers from the  register.",
"The National  Commission (NTC) said as of April 24, 87.44 million, or 52.04 percent of the 168 million total SIM cards that are active, had already been registered.",
SC denies petition seeking to declare SIM registration law unconstitutional,
"THE Supreme Court (SC) has denied the petition seeking to declare the Republic Act 11934, also known as SIM Registration Act, as unconstitutional, the SC Public Information Office (PIO) said Tuesday, April 25, 2023.",
"The petition, which was filed by the National Union of the Philippines (NUJP), Bayan Secretary-General Renato Reyes Jr., lumad leader and former Bayan Muna partylist representative Eufemia Cullamat, among others, sought for the declaration of the law as unconstitutional, prevent its implementation and order the public  entities to cease and desist from using, storing, transferring, and processing all information gathered into the SIM Register, and to destroy data already gathered.“The Supreme Court, during its en banc deliberations today, April 25, 2023, denied the prayer to issue a temporary restraining order in National Union of Journalists of the Philippines Inc., et al.",

Globe uses ‘emergency blast’ for urgent SIM registration reminders,
GLOBE Telecom has tapped the Emergency Cell Broadcast (ECB) system to send out urgent reminders to its users just a few days before the SIM registration deadline.,
This was done to instill urgency on millions of customers who have yet to register their SIMs.,
Globe has used the ECB as  of network management and implemented the emergency blast within acceptable parameters.,
The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) has no objections to the use of ECB after prior notice.,

"For Cañete, the 90-day extension to reach the NTC’s target of registering more SIM cards in the country “might be too much”.“Pero kung moingon ka og paigo na [ang 90-day registration], dili pod ka makaingon na paigo na kay para nako murag sobra na, para nako personal (But if you say the extension will reach our SIM card registration target, I think the extension is too much),” Canete said.“But under the provision of the law under SIM card registration, nag ingon didto na ang DICT, NTC may extend the period of registration for up to 120 days,” Cañete added.",
