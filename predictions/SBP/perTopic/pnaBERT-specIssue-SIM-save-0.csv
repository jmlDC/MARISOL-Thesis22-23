Romualdez calls for easier SIM registration,6.0
"MANILA – Speaker Ferdinand Martin G. Romualdez on Friday urged the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), National  Commission (NTC) and the three  (telcos)  up with a simpler, more convenient and faster process of registering subscriber identity modules (SIMs).",
"In a statement, Romualdez thanked President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. for extending the registration deadline for the millions who failed to register their SIMs, adding that the providers of cellular phone services in the country should make some adjustments.",
"“Let us help the millions of Filipinos who have mobile phones, but who still have not registered their SIMs as required by law, to register. Let us make it easier for them to take advantage of the 90-day registration extension granted by President Marcos,” he said.",
"“In particular, let us assist overseas Filipino workers and their families to register. Their mobile phones are their principal means  and connecting to each other. The thought that they could instantly make audio-video calls eases the pain of being thousands of miles away from home and from their loved ones,” Romualdez said.",
"He also called on the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) and the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) to help the DICT, NTC and telcos inform OFWs and their families of the registration requirements.",
"“I suspect that OFW families in the provinces are finding it difficult  with the registration requirement. Some may even be unaware of it,” Romualdez said.",
The Speaker assumes many OFWs and their families back home are using unlisted prepaid SIMs because of the convenience of acquiring them.,
The House leader lauded telcos for offering registration assistance and mechanisms for their postpaid and prepaid SIM users to list up but asked them “to go the extra mile in seeking out people who have bought and used their SIMs and help them to register so they would be able to continue using their cellular phone service.”,
"“That is to the benefit of the telcos, financially,” Romualdez said.",
"According to reports, as of April 23, or three days before the original April 26 registration deadline was extended by the President, some 82.8 million SIM owners have registered.",
"Of the 82.8 million registrants, 39.9 million signed up with Smart Communications, 37.09 million with Globe Telecom and 5.79 million with DITO  Corp.",
There have been reports that the three telcos have sold a total of 165 million to 170 million SIM cards.,
Speaker Romualdez appealed to the telcos to reveal the number of their postpaid mobile phone subscribers and the total number of active unlisted SIMs that they have sold.,
" data should give us, the public, an idea of how many SIMs, postpaid and prepaid, need to be registered,” he said, adding that telcos should filter their data by discarding inactive SIMs. ",

He said the PNP is actively coordinating with the DICT for a parallel investigation.,
"""We assure the public that we are closely collaborating with DICT to ensure the security, safety, and privacy of information in the custody of the PNP to  with the provisions of the Data Privacy Act,"" Maranan said.",
"Meanwhile, the PNP- Anti-Cybercrime Group  the 90-day extension for the registration of subscriber identity module (SIM) cards.",
