Marcos is heading out straight after the coronation weekend to attend the ASEAN Summit in Indonesia.",14.0,rappler,2023-05-05
"“Sa palagay ko, dahil magkakilala kami, eh dapat magkapag-attend ako (Since we know each other, I should be there),” Marcos told reporters before he left DC to fly to London. The jet-setting Marcos has had 12 foreign trips since  president, the Indonesia summit will be his 13th.

"Marcos spent 8 years in the United Kingdom in the ’70s as a proper posh schoolboy. He attended Worth, a private boarding school for boys (it became co-ed recently) outside London from 1970 to 1974. During his high school years at Worth, his father the former president Ferdinand E. Marcos declared martial law in the Philippines and began a 20-year dictatorship of the country marked by gross human rights violations and corruption.",11.0,rappler,2023-05-05
"In 1975, Marcos began reading for his college degree at the prestigious Oxford University, one of the world’s best universities that has produced leaders both good and bad.

"Cables obtained by the University of the Philippines’ Third World Studies Center reveal that Marcos flunked his exams for his Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) degree not once but twice. Throughout this, Phillippine diplomats in the UK were exerting all their efforts negotiating with Oxford. In the end, they applied for a mitigating circumstance, a British education system of submitting justifications why you deserve an extension. The Philippine diplomats cited Marcos  by flu..exacerbated by the long and exhaustring trips back to London from Manila…and the adverse psychological effects on him after visiting devastated areas in Mindanao after the earthquake and tidal wave.”",14.0,rappler,2023-05-05
"Oxford “departed from its normal rule” of kicking out students who had flunked their exams, and instead allowed Marcos to take exams for a special diploma where he “obtained a reasonable class II level.” The South China Morning Post reported that during this time, after being informed of his flunking, Marcos “went out and gate-crashed a college party,” which was, for the would-be president, “a wild night ending with Bongbong’s Mercedes 450SL sports car crashing into a wall of historic All Souls,” said the reports as quoted by the book Marcos Lies published by the UP Third World Studies Center.

"The invitation from the Palace as among the carefully-selected 2,000 or so VIPs, among them 100 heads of state, is a radical improvement from when Marcos first met a British monarch. Cables from the British foreign office released in 2001, and reported by ABC News, reveal how diplomats cringed at former first lady Imelda Marcos’ request to have an audience with Queen Elizabeth II in 1970. Imelda was taking her son Bongbong to Worth, and she wanted for not only her, but also her son, to meet the Queen. The audience happened, with diplomats noting that “this has never been done before and I cannot understand why it has been allowed in this case.” ",14.0,rappler,2023-05-05
